TOTW 36 Predictions,21-May-18 22:13,"Starting Eleven
Before we jump into this week’s predictions, it is important to mention that certain players may not feature, due to the upcoming Ligue 1 and Serie A TOTS release on Friday.
Also, bigger players may sneak in with weaker performances as we see a lot of the bigger leagues finishing this week.
Areola 
We kick start these predictions with a Ligue 1 player, a player who has an outside chance at a team of the season as well. Areola pulled of 6 incredible saves against Caen, to secure a point for the French Champions, and with a lack of competition, he has put himself in a fantastic position here.
Pereira 
Over to the Super Lig next, where Trabzonspor played host to Karabukspor. The game consisted of 3 goals, and each one of these went in favour of the hosts. Pereira was the man behind two of these, and when we consider that he is a full-back, who also managed to keep a clean sheet, the achievement becomes even more impressive.
Dubois 
Back across to France now, where a single goal separated Nantes and Strasbourg in their Ligue 1 fixture. Dubois was the man behind the goal, and was also a part of the defensive structure that provided a clean sheet. Ticking two boxes could very possibly be enough to see his name in lights this week.
Rugani 
Over to Italy next, and a game where we saw Buffon end his magical career at Juventus. The game itself was very tight, and Juventus only just edged out a 2-1 victory. Now while Rugani didn’t keep a clean sheet, he did score the winning goal, and with the Serie A TOTS dropping this week, maybe he can steal a spot amongst the others!
Vecino 
Now whether a hero card or a team of the week card is more fitting, is debatable for sure, however the importance of Vecino’s goal, simply cannot go unnoticed. Inter Milan pulled off a 3-2 win against Lazio, and with the winner securing Champions League next season, this match literally had everything to play for. Vecino scored a late winner, after a penalty brought Inter Milan back into the match, and with it, we will see Inter Milan in the CL next year!
Sanson 
Is this selection a little ambitious? Possibly. Was Sanson absolutely incredible on the weekend? Not really. However with the lack of big games, and especially big performances from midfielders, a goal during a 2-1 win for Marseille, may just about be enough to see him receive his first special card of the year.
Calhanoglu 
AC Milan have had an extremely average season, one that definitely fell short of expectations. With the final game of the season, a home match against Fiorentina, they at least managed to ends things on a high. A 5-1 win here showed what they are building, and with a goal and 3 assists, Calhanoglu comfortably makes our shortlist.
Rony Lopes
I’m starting to worry myself with some of these choices, as once again we see a player who could easily feature within the Ligue 1 TOTS. Although we run this risk, we can’t ignore top performances based on speculation and hence Lopes makes our predictions thanks to his 2 goals, during a 3-0 win for Monaco against Troyes.
David Villa
America is our next stop, where NYCFC player hosts to Colorado. The match brought us four goals, and sadly for Colorado, they all went in favour of the hosts. Villa scored twice and assisted a third, which is more than likely enough to secure him his first Inform of the campaign.
Depay
Damn! This man may not have started the season with a bang, but his performances for the second half have been nothing short of incredible. Another game, and yet another hat-trick. Lyon beat Nice 3-2 on the weekend, and while normally Depay would be a lock, the likelihood of a team of the season card this week may see him miss out.
Gomez 
Over to Spain for our next selection, where Celta Vigo and Levante faced off in the final game of their season. In a game that provided us with 6 goals, four went in favour of the home side. Now while Aspas has a chance, after scoring twice, our nomination goes with Gomez, who scored twice and also provided an assist.

TOTW25 Predictions,05-Mar-18 14:17,"Starting Eleven
Ederson 
First up this week we have what could be seen as a slightly controversial pick. Manchester City beat Arsenal for the second time in a single week and during the 3-0 away victory, Sane both scored and assisted. Ederson however ensured that Arsenal’s early pressure was to no avail and with 5 saves, including one from the spot, he is our choice this week.
Barzagli 
Juventus were away to Lazio on the weekend and in an incredibly tight match they managed to just edge out a 1-0 victory. Barzagli was solid at the back, stopping Lazio in their tracks and ensuring the clean sheet was maintained. We all know how EA like to include a big defensive name, this could be Barzagli’s time to shine!
Hubner 
Hoffenheim were away to Augsburg for their Bundesliga fixture and with a promising performance they left with all three points in a 2-0 win. Hubner at the back was like a rock, defensively great and he even provided an assist.
Traore 
Angers played hosts to Guingamp in their Ligue 1 clash and with a dominating display they left as 3-0 victors. There were some fantastic performances throughout the side, but Traore at centre-back ensured the clean sheet and scored one of the goals too.
Vazquez 
Sevilla played hosts to Athletic Bilbao for their La Liga clash and it was one was traffic as the hosts picked up all the points in a 2-0 win. Vazquez was the player who really stood out, scoring once and assisting the second. He picked up the man of the match award, can he also grab himself his first Inform of the year?
Sung-yueng 
A few months back and everybody simply assumed Swansea were done for, they were a team facing relegation no matter what. A new manager and a fantastic new approach has changed everything, with Swansea now sitting mid-table it would be a shock to see them not stay up. This was enforced with another incredible win on the weekend as they destroyed West Ham 4-1. A goal and an assist from midfielder Sung-yueng should be enough to see him pick up an Inform as well.
Feghouli 
This was a painful decision, one that shouldn’t have had to made. Galatasaray were on the road this weekend and in an absolute masterclass they left as 7-0 winners. Gomis scores four goals in a single half and because he featured in the current team of the week, we are forced to exclude him from the predictions. Feghouli however was also incredible and while he may not have scored, he did pick up three assists in a dominating display of class.
Son 
Run for cover guys, because it’s happening again! The man who gave us all nightmares last year on FIFA is back with yet another Inform (most likely) this year. Tottenham comfortably beat Huddersfield 2-0 on the weekend and with Son scoring both, I would be shocked to not see him feature.
Griezmann 
Atletico played hosts to Leganes midweek and in an absolutely dominating performance, they left as 4-0 winners. After missing out on an Inform last week due to having a man of the match card in packs, there is no way Griezmann can be passed up again. Scoring all four goals in the 4-0 victory is surely enough to make the cut this time!
Dzeko
In a weekend that shocked the footballing world with the horrific death of Astori, not many Serie A games took place this weekend. Roma were away to Napoli on Saturday and in a 6 goal thriller picked up a 4-2 win. The whole team were fantastic, but Dzeko scored twice and was incredible throughout.
Jonas 
This man made our predictions last week and was somehow excluded from the line-up. Benfica destroyed Maritimo 5-0 on the weekend and with Jonas picking himself up a hat-trick in a dominating performance, there is no chance he misses out this time around!
 
Substitutes
Muller
Mainz were away to Hamburg for their Bundesliga clash and although the game ended in a goalless draw, one man deserves some recognition. Muller was fantastic between the sticks and despite his side being reduced to 10 men, he commanded his defensive line, pulled off 6 saves and even stopped a penalty.
Dunk
Brighton were hosts to Arsenal for their Sunday fixture and for the first time in years, Arsenal picked up a fourth successive loss. The entire Brighton team were fantastic, defensively right and dangerous pushing forward. Murray could very easily take this spot with the lack of defenders available this week and just a single goal from Murray, Dunk gets our vote. In a 2-1 win, he scored once and despite conceding, was solid at the back!
Welinton
Alanyaspor were away for their weekend match and in an extremely tight match, they just managed to edge out a 1-0 victory. Welinton at the back was absolutely incredible, controlling the match and locking down his defensive line.
Horta
Braga were away to Estoril on the weekend and once again, goals were flowing in Portugal. Braga left as 6-0 victors and with so many top tier performances, picking a single nomination wasn’t easy. Horta on the left not only scored twice but assisted a further two. Surely playing a part in four games will be enough to make the cut.
Linssen 
Vitesse played hosts to Ajax on Sunday and despite the odds being stacked against them, they took all the points in a narrow 3-2 victory. Linssen on the wing was incredible, scoring twice and wrapping up the points for his side.
Kilinc 
Sivasspor were away to Antalyaspor for their weekend fixture and after coming out as 4-1 winners, it looks like the journey was worthwhile.Kilinc assisted twice and scored another which could just be enough to secure him a spot.
Wenger 
The MLS returned this week and with it a whole heap of explosive results. Houston were hosts to Atlanta United for their first fixture and in a dominating performance they left as 4-0 winners. Wenger was incredible throughout, scoring one, assisting another and taking the man of the match award too.
Gomez 
Stuttgart were away to F.C Cologne for their Bundesliga clash and in a 5 goal thriller they just managed to edge out a 3-2 victory. Tommy on the wing provided all 3 assists, however our nomination goes with Gomez who scored twice and was incredible throughout.

*Gomez PTG card stats will be upgraded and his club will be changed to VfB Stuttgart if he make it to the TOTW
Kuwas 
Heracles we’re away to Roda for their Eredivisie clash on Friday and it seems like the journey was worthwhile, as they left with a comfortable 3-0 win. Kuwas on the wing was the man of the hour, scoring once and assisting another, with a near perfect match rating as well!
Bamford 
Middlesborough played hosts to Leeds in the Championship and with a fantastic performance from the entire team, they left as 3-0 winners. Bamford was the man of the hour, scoring not one, not two, but three goals, to be the first Championship player included with a hat-trick this week.
Reid 
We’re staying in the Championship for yet another pick and another hat-trick. Bristol City were 4-0 winners at home to Sheffield Wednesday on the weekend and Reid was the hero. Picking himself up two goals from open play and one from the spot to wrap up his hat-trick.
Oztumer 
We stay in England once more and dropping down a division we come across yet another hat-trick. Walsall were away to Southend and during a 3-0 victory for the visitors, it was Oztumer who scored all three. It’s tough to exclude someone with three goals, however seeing EA exclude one of the above wouldn’t surprise me."
Review - Record Breaker Milner,01-May-18 07:10,"Another Liverpool Champions League game, another Hamez Milner assist.  Last Tuesday, Milner notched yet another assist in Liverpool’s 5-2 victory over Roma extending his total to 9 for the campaign.  In doing so Milner further surpasses the Brazilian James Milner’s (Neymar) and the Man Bear Pig’s (Rooney) previously shared record of 7.  Milner’s record setting performances earned him a Record Breaker card in the latest group of MOTM cards.
In looking at the EPL midfield options I couldn’t help but think that Milner could be the solution to some of my squad issues.  Reliance on Calcio A (hate calling it this) midfielders such as Nainggolan, FB Florenzi (God), and SMS has created endless problems for me and other players I am interested in.  I went straight to work with Milner, applying a HUNTER chem style, and deploying him in the LEFT and RIGHT CAM of a 4-2-2-2.  Milner was the engine in the following squad:

 
PACE
Base stats alone, Milner’s pace is the obvious deficiency.  Even with HUNTER applied you cannot get away from the fact that Milner is slow at this stage in FIFA.  If this is three months ago I am not sure it is even an issue.  But at this stage in the game Milner literally cannot keep up with the competition.  If midfield speed is a necessity for your squad to properly work then unfortunately Milner will leave you disappointed.  However, if you can look past this obvious deficiency, James Milner offers a lot more than most of the quick players I have tried.
RATING: 3.5/5
 
SHOOTING
Having applied HUNTER for pace, the boosts to Milner’s shooting were a welcome bonus.  Milner can crack a ball from anywhere on the pitch and it causes keepers issues.  Some players seem to have an elevation to their shots that helps allude the height of most keepers when they dive, and Milner is one of them.  Bobby Firmino and Ruud Gullit are two other cards that I have used that have both velocity and height upon striking a ball.  This puts Milner in some excellent company and his 4 STAR WEAK FOOT doesn’t hurt either.  One concern would be his finishing.  Milner is often in the right place at the right time and this opened up quite a few chances throughout the weekend.  However, he can definitely miss some open chances and my issue was with hitting the keeper, rather than missing the goal.
RATING: 4/5
 
PASSING, DRIBBLING & DEFENDING
In some of my previous reviews I have combined stats for different reasons, but never have I combined three.  Yet, as I sit here thinking about the past weekend with this card it just makes sense.  One of the best compliments I can give this card, is that it plays like James Milner does in real life.  He is consistent, not exactly flashy, but gets the job done.  This type of consistency mixed with a Beatles-esk haircut explains why Milner parody accounts such as Boring James Milner are entertaining.  But then you see the results of consistency; assists, tackles, possession, and goals and you start to realize that consistency is really entertaining.  It is fun when your players find the right pass and it reaches your streaking Salah rather than missing two yards behind; it is fun to dribble by players as they fly into challenges; and it is fun when your player goes into a tackle and actually comes out with the ball.  If that is the results of Boring James Milner, then I hope he keeps the Wolverine side burns till the day he dies.  I am starting to realize that it is the little things in FIFA that make me enjoy different players.  And seeing James Milner with his side burns flowing, piggy backing CR7 after just setting scoring the game winning goal, brings me more joy then it should.
RATING (PASSING): 4.5/5
RATING (DRIBBLING): 4/5
RATING (DEFENDING): 4.5/5
 
PHYSICAL
If the 5 base stats Milner has rated 80 overall and up, Milner’s physical stats are the most intriguing.  One 60: 68 JUMPING, one 70: 77 STRENGTH, one 80: 84 AGGRESSION, and one 90: 96 STAMINA.  If I am honest I did not look over all of Milner’s stats before jumping into this weekend’s FUT Champs.  I saw a shiny blue and red card, with crazy base stats, in the Premier League, with strong links to Salah, and I jumped in with both feet.  It wasn’t until about game 10 that I went back and looked closer at this card.  I was shocked the Milner was at only 68 JUMPING, because at 5’8 I did not remember him losing a ball in the air.  In fact he even scored a few headers along the way.  Perhaps a less central position reduced the amount of big midfielders he was jumping against?  I do not have the exact answer, but it was a welcome bonus in a position that I am normally losing aerial battles.
RATING: 4/5
 
FINAL SCORE
RATING: 4/5
If I had to pick a song to go with this card it would be “Steady, As She Goes” by the Raconteurs.  Milner just bobs along to the beat of his own drum, quietly making huge contributions to your squad in his own simple, “boring” way. But all memes, Twitter parodies, and Hamez jokes aside, this card is entertaining to use.  I am quite torn moving forward with my own team as I know there are slightly better options available.  However, none fit into my team as easily as this card, and none have such a well-rounded set of attributes, especially for 100k.  The price of Miner’s card has been largely effected by numerous pack openings in relation to TOTS and lightning rounds; and with that Record Breaker James Milner has entered the category of: “You might as well give it a try if you are interested, what do you have to lose.”  That is my ultimate recommendation for FUT Managers.  He is 100% worth a try; his stats and attributes far exceed the cost, and if you turn around and sell him you are looking at minimal loses.  But I should warn you, it doesn’t get any better than seeing the long lost member of the Beatles slamming home goals and then knee sliding to the corner flag, just picture a guitar in his hands.  
Cheers for Reading!

REVIEW - TOTS FIRMINO,08-May-18 08:55,"As the blue tide of TOTS cards continue to come rolling into the FUT markets; it is hard for FUT Mangers to decide which direction to go, myself included.  Having tired and enjoyed every version of Roberto Firmino in FIFA 18, I made the decision to continue upgrading from the PTG and purchased TOTS Bobby prior to Weekend League starting.
The past few FUT Champ competitions I have been using a 4-2-2-2 formation with more success than in the past and so I needed to fit Bobby into the squad.  In the past I would have probably preferred a 4-2-3-1 and used him as a CAM.  In the end I decided to use Bobby as the LEFT ST in the 4-2-2-2 and used FALSE 9 player instructions, pulling him back into the midfield to receive the ball.  I have always used HUNTER on past versions of Firmino, yet upon further inspection I realized that HAWK provided a larger boost and less wasted ratings above 99, so I went with that.  Firmino was the talisman in the following squad:

 
PACE
FINALLY! Every past version of this card has been slightly short in the pace department.  All it took was five upgrades to finally get to a level where I can use this card and not think, “should I be looking at a slightly quicker option.” There are quite a few cards out there, and I have reviewed many who do not live up to their pace statistics.  Bobby is definitely not one of them and I could immediately feel the increase in his quickness.  He does not quite reach the lightning levels of 2POTM Salah or TOTS Alejandro Gomez but he is still rapid and a huge improvement on his past cards.
RATING: 4.5/5
 
PHYSICAL & SHOOTING
TOTS Firmino plays like he is 6’3 - 250 pounds (18 Stone) and yet can dribble like a magical pixie, which I will get to later in the review.  Like I was saying, the man plays like a giant and simply inflicts himself upon opponents.  I would liken Firmino’s Physical and Shooting to Thunder and Lighting, especially with HAWK applied.  Thunder: He is powerful when sprinting, strong when protecting the ball (92 STRENGTH), amazing in the air (99 JUMPING), and finally 99 STAMINA means he can do all of this. All. Game. Long.  Lighting: 4 STAR WEAK FOOT and 99 RATED SHOOTING STATS in ALL CATEGORIES except penalties.  The ball flashes off of his foot and it took me a few games to adjust having hit numerous crossbars early on.  If you are playing next week and notice dents in the FeWC Stadium nets, that was me, or at least it was Bobby. After I sorted out the power adjustment I was shocked at how many balls would find the top corners and I had a lot of fun hammering shots from around the pitch and really testing the limits of this card…. I didn’t find many.
PHYSICAL RATING: 5/5
SHOOTING RATING: 5/5   
 
DRIBBLING
I already referenced the magical WL pixie, but I will elaborate a bit.  Any FUT Managers who have previously owned a Firmino card will know that this guy is silky on the ball.  Now, with 90 RATED DRIBBLING STATS across the board (87 COMPOSURE just under) it is incredible to see him get even better on the ball.  Responsive turning, touch tight dribbling, fluent direction changes, and agility while dribbling at pace all add to the threat of this card.  Bobby is like Houdini on the ball and it didn’t matter how many extra defenders were brought in to lock me down, I felt like I could escape any situation with relative ease.  One thing I noticed is how close he keeps the ball in his feet when cutting and often avoids the outstretched legs of would be defenders.  I could almost hear Ray Hudson screaming “MAGIC!!!” as I swerved through my opponents barrage of pylons.  If you can’t tell already I really, really, like the dribbling on this card.
RATING: 5/5
 
PASSING & DEFENDING
While I always struggle to quantify the passing stats in FUT reviews, I will say that Firmino’s 84 CROSSING feels like it is about 15 stat points short.  In my video are a few examples, but that is a small sample set.  Often in the second half I will sub in TOTS Alejandro Gomez which moves Bobby out to the LEFT CAM of the 4-2-2-2.  In all honesty Bobby is almost more dangerous as a playmaker than in the box himself.  The crosses he whips in are accurate and have a height that lands the ball perfectly into the dangerous positions for attackers.  In these wide positions I was also able to see some of Firmino’s defensive work on display.  While low defensive ratings affect Firmino’s ability to dispossess opponents running at him.  The pace, strength, and dribbling stats Firmino does have make him a threat when chasing down opponents.  I wouldn’t be starting him as a CDM, but if FUT Managers are interested in a CM who can chip in with some goals I would definitely give Bobby a shot.
PASSING RATING: 4.5/5
DEFENSIVE RATING: 3.5/5
 
FINAL SCORE: 
RATING: 4.9/5
During every Firmino celebration you have the opportunity to observe his neck tattoo of a crown and the name “Deus” (God) attached.  While I don’t recommend getting your name tattooed on your neck, I will make an exception in Bobby’s case.  At the risk of getting carried away I will summarize TOTS Roberto Firmino by saying he is the best attacking player I have used in FUT this year.  NIF Ronaldo, 90 Rated Aubameyang, 98 POTY Salah, Prime ADP, and the list goes on.  None of the aforementioned players can match Firmino in the key category for a striker, stats.  If I hadn’t spent the first five games trying to rip the net apart I would say that I could have added at least 5 goals to my final review picture, he is that good.  Beyond goals and assists you even have the little things thrown in with this card.  One example would be his heading.  If you are late in a match and you need to launch the ball forward from goal kicks or clearances he beats most CB’s in the air and you can relieve the pressure.  All weekend long I was surprised with the different qualities in this card.  I based my final score on the attacking abilities of TOTS Firmino and in all honesty I feel like he is the complete package and a 5/5.  However, I want to reserve this rating in case a card should come around that really blows me away.  As it stands, Bobby Firmino is the perfect storm for my team and he rained down punishment on my opponents throughout the weekend, I don’t doubt he would do the same for you.  
Cheers for reading!

Game Highlights:"
Double Review - OTW 86 MKH & OTW 85 Batman,10-Feb-18 08:58,"Henrikh Mkhitaryan is one of those high rated players that is rarely used this year, but sparks some interest when he earns himself an inform. Arsenal v. Everton ended with Mkhitaryan assisting three goals in just his second match for Arsenal, enough to earn a spot in this weeks TOTW. His enticing 5 star weak foot, dribbling, and passing stats raise some eyebrows and have lead to me playing 11 games with the card and reporting back to you.
This review is based off of 8/11 games using Mkhitaryan with a “Basic” chemistry style, then “Marksman”. The reviews are based on this squad:
​​
PACE
Mkhitaryan’s pace reminds me a lot of Okocha with his size and speed. Mkhi. is not very tall (5’9”) and has 91 agility, those two stats paired with his 89 acceleration and 84 sprint speed means it’s easier to staple jello to the wall then to catch Mkhitaryan on a run. He accelerates like he’s been shot out of a catapult meaning most players are left coughing in his dust. It seriously takes him no time at all to go from completely still to his top speed, like a rocket blasting off but if you skip all of the “T-minus 10 seconds to blast off” stuff. At this point I’m convinced you have a better chance of catching measles than Mkhitaryan.
Rating; 4/5
SHOOTING
This is where I’m a little confused with his card. I’ll start with the good stuff, 89 shot power is immense, I thought he had blown a hole in the net a couple of different times. That and his 84 positioning were impressive, as he seemed to be in the right place at the right time, especially right in front of net. But…he only has 78 finishing and 76 long shots. Sadly his finishing felt like 78 finishing, it was mediocre. There were times where he wouldn’t even get it on target or would just smash it into De Gea’s chest. But then there were also times that he would score a worldie or volley one into the top corner. It’s honestly hit or miss and in my opinion here you should be boosting his shooting stats to some degree if you want to use his card.
Rating; 3/5
PASSING
This is where his card really begins to shine, and rightfully so considering how he got his inform! 88 short passing, 89 vision, and 87 curve set Henrikh apart from the rest. He uses and abuses his 5 star weak foot by ruling the midfield like Mussolini, Stalin, or Kim Jong-Un would. Especially if you switch this card to a CAM in game he is the one pulling strings and starting everything, no play works it’s way up the field without touching his foot at least twice, which makes sense because he does have the “Playmaker” trait. The only disappointing stat (aside from FK’s) in this category is his 75 long passing, which leaves something to be desired, so I’d stick with the short passing for most parts.
Rating; 4/5
DRIBBLING
Yes, it’s all I have to say. But that’d be no fun, so I’ll explain. This Armenian maestro has 91 agility, 89 ball control, 89 dribbling, and 86 balance. Weaving in and out is his specialty and all he wants to do is send Aubameyang on goal, so he will stop at nothing to keep that ball on his foot. Something about this card gives him an unreal touch and quick feet, making it an absolute joy to watch him, let alone use him on the pitch. He puts on a better show than Queen or AC/DC, and he makes it his job to make Kante and Vieira look stupid. It’s like his 5 star weak foot makes his dribbling better because his stats don’t look insane, just really good. He makes walking up the field with the ball entertaining and impressive. He could probably make an instant ramen dinner look fancy. This has to be his best stat, and if you like an agile dribbling winger, Mkhitaryan could be your man.
Rating; 4/5
PHYSICAL
No one likes to look at the physical stats of a short player, because usually you end up having to justify getting them afterwards. 87 stamina is the only thing that’s remotely green in this category so buckle up it’s going to be fun. 63 strength and 69 aggression on him mean he’s like an Armenian blade of wheat, blowing over quite easily. But to be honest it doesn’t feel that low, his agility and balance mean he’s pretty good at staying on his feet. But the real trouble is when he’s fighting shoulder to shoulder with someone because that’s most definitely his kryptonite. Having his shirt pulled? No big deal, body slammed by Bailly? Catch him in the ICU.
Rating; 2.5/5
 
MENTALITY
Possibly my second favorite part for Henrikh is this right here, all about his weak foot and traits. Four star skill moves and five star weak foot make this card more appetizing than a tide pod. You’ll love not having to worry about which foot to shoot on, and even better is his passing is always at 100% since it’s not relying on his weak foot. It honestly makes such a huge difference and I adore having any player with a five star weak foot. That being said he also has four star skill moves, meaning he’s got everything he needs to beat that defensive player and break down the line. He also has the “Flair”, “Speed dribbler”, “Playmaker”, and for some odd reason the “Long Shot Taker” trait.
Rating; 4/5

CONSENSUS
Rating; 3.58/5
Henrikh Mkhitaryan is an incredibly dynamic and impressive player. Sitting at just below 200,000 coins I’d like to say there are better options on the wing, but he does bring a lot of things that many don’t offer, the most prevalent option being that five star weak foot. He’s a fantastic playmaker and amazing with the ball on his feet but lacks some finishing. In my opinion I’d give his non-inform a try first as it’s cheap enough, and if you get along with it then upgrade to his IF as you can still feel improvement between the two cards. I can’t say he justifies his price tag of 200,000 coins as that’s a bit exorbitant at the moment but if you have the coins by all means. I’d recommend his OTW over the LW card because if he gets a SIF he will be one of the best wingers you can get. If you change your formation in game I recommend using Mkhitaryan as a CAM because it’s the other position he’s built to play in! If you’re going to use a chemistry style I’d suggest a boost to his shooting, and maybe his physical. Otherwise best of luck to you and Henrikh as I hope the relationship works out.
 
Game Stats:
​​

 
Michy ‘Batman’ Batshuayi should be a household name from now on, let me explain just why. He ended up getting two goals and an assist on his debut for Borrusia Dortmund clearly earning himself a spot in this weeks TOTW. He had already gotten a special card for Chelsea, but this card for Dortmund would be considered his SIF card. Are we going to see more Batman in upcoming Weekend Leagues or will people favor Werner and Aubameyang more?
PACE
 
Michy Batshuayi is a tall player, 6’0” to be exact. Usually that means lower agility and balance right? Well apparently not. He has 85 agility and balance, as well as 81 acceleration and 85 sprint speed. For a taller player he is no stranger to speed that’s for sure. He does a great job pushing his way through to goal and has enough pace to do so. Now what I’m getting at is he’s not very fast, 84 pace is good! But nowadays doesn’t exactly cut it for top of the line striker. What sets Batshuayi apart is that he’s strong, tall, and has surprisingly good pace to back it all up. He reminds me a lot of Marco Van Basten when it comes to speed. He takes these long strides and if someone dares to catch up he has no trouble stiff-arming them. I honestly love his pace for this type of a card and did not feel let down at all. What I feel is that it fits his type of play style and card very well because usually you’d expect 80 or less pace for his type of play.
Rating; 3.5/5
SHOOTING
This is where you start to really get along with Marco Van Ba…I mean Batshuayi. Let me read off the statistics, 92 positioning, 92 finishing, 92 shot power, 84 long shots. God almighty that’s making me sweat a little bit. He is so clinical, I have no clue if that has to do with his 88 composure but he keeps reminding me of Marco Van Basten as time goes on. Shooting with Batshuayi is much like throwing a bowling ball with the gutter guards up, there’s no way you miss (unless you’re like my friend Paul who managed to throw it into the other lane, don’t be like Paul). Pressing the B button with Batshuayi is 9.8/10 a goal, and the 0.2/10 times is because De Gea saved it with his feet. Pressing shoot = scoring goal. But I do have a bone to pick with Batman here, his curve is terrible. I do not recommend trying to finesse the ball from long ranges, but rather power the shot. If you’re one-on-one a low driven finesse is still optimal but don’t try and replicate Messi or Ronaldo curling the ball in from distance and odd angles as it’s not his strong point.
Rating; 4.5/5
PASSING
There is not much to say here, he’s bad at passing might suffice though. 75 short passing, 42 long passing, 74 vision, 72 curve, and 77 crossing is embarrassing. He’s not a playmaking card, and definitely not a CAM. He’s fit to play as a ST and that’s the end of the discussion, while he did manage to get 6 assists for me in those 11 games it was mostly from easy passes right in front of net. Don’t try and create plays with Batshuayi but rather let him finish them. If you’re not using a chemistry style to boost his passing then avoid his.
Rating; 2.5/5
DRIBBLING
Batshuayi has a pleasant 84 dribbling on his card, and it’s evenly spread out. But my favorite stats aren’t his 84 ball control and 82 dribbling, but rather 85 agility and balance. The more agile a player is, the better he feels when he’s doing anything and everything. You don’t want a clunky player trying his best to stand up straight but is able to dribble like Neymar. You’d rather a player who can stand up straight really well and has decent dribbling, which is what Batshuayi has. He feels fluid on the ball for a taller player and is no stranger to taking good, close touches with the ball. His dribbling isn’t fantastic, but actually rather impressed me and made me like his card even more. If I had to compare his dribbling to someone I’d say Morata, Immobile, and one of the IF Cavani’s.
Rating; 3.5/5
PHYSICAL
This is what makes this card what it is. 88 strength and 88 jumping are amazing. Batman doesn’t need Robin when he can body slam anyone that gets near him. He seriously will stiff arm anyone getting in his way and will not get pulled down. He has 85 balance and agility, and 88 strength. That means he not only can shove people away and hold his own but has amazing balance and agility to keep himself on his feet. He has good speed for a tall and strong player, good strength for a fast and tall player, and good height for a strong and fast player. It’s such a wonderful trio of things that I’m left very impressed by this SIF Batshuayi. But I’d be bad at my job if I didn’t mention his sad 71 stamina. He has issues playing the whole game through and by the 80th minute will be dragging his feet and begging to be subbed off for Musa.
Rating; 4/5
MENTALITY
Honestly my reaction here is, m’kay. He has three star skill moves and four star weak foot. The four star weak foot is really great and helps his ridiculous shooting even more…but the skill moves are a let down. It’s really nice to be able to pull off a Berba spin or something impressive to make that pesky defender fall on his butt, but Michy has to rely on his strength. His only trait is the “Selfish” trait which doesn’t exactly suit his card too well since he will really only be getting the ball when he’s through on goal as that’s the role he plays best. But to be fair the “Engine” chemistry style covers all the areas he lacks in so he might shine even more.
Rating; 3/5

CONSENSUS
Rating; 3.5/5
Michy ‘Batman’ Batshuayi is a really great Bundesliga striker card to use, and I think I could even say the best one. He has such a great powerful shot, good pace, fantastic strength and physical, as well as decent dribbling. But he’s not very dynamic. He has one job and that’s to break through on goal, muscle defenders off, and score. He’s no Mertens who is a pest anywhere on the pitch and can curl in shots from odd angles. Neither is he like Werner or Gnabry who have pace and dribbling on their side. But he fits more of an Ibrahimovic/Lewandowski role. He kind of sits in this grey area inbetween where he’s fast enough, but also strong enough to be both a target striker and to get in behind. Personally I prefer him to get in behind and break through on goal because his passing is trash for working up plays. But he’s honestly a better Lewandowski in my eyes. If you use an “Engine” chemistry style on him to boost his pace, passing, and dribbling, I would consider him the best Bundesliga striker and at a great price too (90,000 coins). All I’m saying is he scores goals, and that’s really that. Don’t expect too much of him aside from putting the ball in the back of the net as he’s not a flashy player but more restricted. Is he ready for the weekend league? I’d say yes, but there are many better options that aren’t too expensive (IF Mertens, SIF Icardi, IF Son, etc.)"
TOTW 33 Predictions,30-Apr-18 17:39,"Starting Eleven
Zieler 
Our first stop this week is Germany, where we find Stuttgart away to Leverkusen. Now a brief look at the match stats shows that Leverkusen controlled the game; with 21 total shots, 7 on target, a penalty and 65% possession, you would have assumed they were at least clinical enough to score a couple. Sadly, for them, this wasn’t the case. Stuttgart however, had a single shot on goal, which they converted, but the man of the hour is without doubt Zieler, the man between the sticks. With 7 saves, including one from the spot, he single-handedly won Stuttgart the points here.
Cuadrado 
Juventus were away to Inter Milan for their weekend fixture, and with things so close towards the top of the table, a loss here could have seen them hand the title to Napoli. With just minutes remaining on the clock, and Inter winning 2-1, Juventus did what Juventus do best, and turned the game on its head. An own goal from Skriniar and a late winner from Higuain wrapped up the points, but the man of the match has to be Cuadrado. Playing out of position at full back, not only was he incredible both going forward and defensively, but he also contributed with an assist as well.
Schweinsteiger 
Over to America next, and a selection that may shock most. Chicago were away to Toronto for their MLS match, and in a game of four goals, neither side could quite edge out the win. Schweinsteiger however was sensational, not only was he playing as a center-back, but after missing an initial penalty, he went on to score from open play and provide the assist for their second. Could we see this man as a shock inclusion this week?
Hack
Mainz played host to Leipzig for their Bundesliga clash on Sunday, and thanks to some fantastic performances across the team, they took all the points in a 3-0 victory. Hack was incredible at the back, and while he may not have provided any goals or assists, he hardly put a foot wrong across the 90 minutes, while his goal line clearance was as valuable as a goal up the other end.
Van Aanholt
Crystal Palace have had a tough relegation battle to deal with over the past few months, however the fantastic form they have found themselves in recently, has seen them climb to the middle of the table. This form was once again present while at home to Leicester on the weekend, the 5-0 win saw goals split evenly across 5 players, but with a clean sheet and dominating game at the back on top of this, Van Aanholt is our man this week.
Tadic 
From a side that appears to have escaped the drop, to one that is very much still fighting for their lives now. Southampton have had a really rough ride in the Premier League this year, and while most never expected them to be in this position, with just a couple of matches left, anything could happen. This weekend they were hosts to Bournemouth, and in a narrow 2-1 victory, it was Tadic who was in fine form, scoring both the goals and helping his side edge that little bit closer to safety.
Gueye 
Everton were away to Huddersfield on the weekend, and while they may not have had the season many were expecting, it looks like they are slowly getting themselves back on track, while laying the foundations for next year. A 2-0 win on the road suggests progress, and while with just a single goal Gueye would usually miss out, with the sheer volume of players receiving TOTS cards over the upcoming weeks, combined with his brilliant performance here, perhaps we could see him sneak into the line-up.
Sterling 
Next up is a bit of a controversial pick, now this isn't because his performance wasn’t TOTW worthy or because he is undeserving, this is simply because we are expecting the Premier League TOTS to drop on Friday, and having the cards overlap makes no sense. Either way, these predictions are based off facts, and during Man City's 4-1 win away to West Ham, Sterling and his 3 assists was a testament of just how far he has come as a player this year. With this being said, I wouldn't be surprised to see a shock inclusion of somebody like Jesus for his single goal instead.
Dzeko
Roma have been absolutely incredible this year, and while they may not be pushing for a Serie A title, they have been solid in the league and their Champions League run has been a pleasure to watch. Dzeko has been a fundamental part of this, and during Roma's 4-1 victory over Chievo on the weekend, he showed just what he is capable of. Two goals and a man of the match performance could be enough to see this man receive yet another upgrade.
Kramaric 
Kramaric has been incredible at point this season, and his transition from winger to striker, has been completed with near perfect results. Hoffenheim were 3-1 victors over the travelling Hannover on Friday, and while the team were solid throughout, Kramaric with three goals to his name, was the only man that was ever making his way into these predictions.
Messi 
Over to Spain for our final spot in the starting eleven, and while this feels unlikely to actually happen (much like Sterling), these predictions need to be based of factual results and figures, and hence leaving Messi out was never an option. Barcelona picked up a 4-2 win on the road to Deportivo, and while Suarez provided 3 assists and Messi 3 goals, the sheer volume of special cards they have already accumulated, combined with the La Liga TOTS approaching, makes me a little weary as to whether EA will allow this to happen.
 
Substitutes
Wellenreuther
Our first choice for the substitues sees us heading over to the Eredivisie, where Willem II were away to PEC Zwolle. Once again, the stats suggest that the home team should have secured a comfortable win and all the points, however the sensational form of Wellenreuther was simply too much for them to handle. With 9 saves and a fantastic match from start to finish, this man has to be nailed on this week.
Morrison 
Over to the Championship now, where Cardiff were on the road to Hull. A fantastic performance throughout ensured that the visitors secured the points with a 2-0 win, and when we consider just how magnificent Morrison was defensively and then add the fact that he scored both the goals, we surely have to be seeing a second inform this week.
Kaldirim 
Over to Turkey now, where Fenerbahce were away to Kasimpasa for their Super Lig fixture. The visitors secured a comfortable 4-1 win, and there were plenty of possible TOTW candidates to choose from. Souza was solid in the middle with a goal to his name, Ozbayrakli was great at right-back, and also secured a goal, however our nomination goes with the left-back, Kaldrim. An assist and man of the match award may just be enough to see him secure his first special card of the campaign.
Almiron 
Back across to America now, where Atlanta United were hosts to Montreal for their MLS fixture. It was a comfortable win for the hosts, with the match finishing 4-1, and despite Kratz coming off the bench to score twice, our nomination simply has to go with Almiron. A near perfect match rating, a goal from open play and one from the spot, just has to be enough to see this man get upgraded.
Fernandes 
Sporting were away to Portimonense for their Liga Nos fixture this week, and in a game that provided 3 goals, it was the visitors who managed to steal the points with a 2-1 win. Fernandes was the man of the hour, running circles around the oppositions defensive line and scoring both of the goals for Sporting.
Pepe
For those of you who have previously completed the Ligue 1 SBC, you will likely still have nightmares around just how expensive Lille was to complete. Obviously as the year draws on, the costs have started to drop, but this inform a few months back would have been incredible. Pepe was in fine form during Lille's 3-1 win over Metz, scoring once, assisting another and receiving an incredible match rating too.
Bacca 
Spain is our next stop, and Bacca is the next prediction who is surely nailed on to receive an inform. During Villarreal's 4-1 win over Celta Vigo, Bacca scored not once, not twice, but three times to wrap up his hat-trick. This is one of those players that you can almost guarantee a spot for.
Petersen 
Petersen has had a fantastic season with Freiburg so far, goals have been flowing and this weekend was no exception. Freiburg edged out the points against FC Cologne in a 3-2 win, and once again Petersen was the hero on the day. Scoring twice and wrapping up the man of the match award, we could very possibly be seeing a third inform for this striker.
Simeone 
With Juventus trailing 2-1 to Inter with just minutes left, Napoli fans were surely considering the possibility of a Serie A title this year. However, after seeing Juventus pick up a win, it looks like spirits began to drop and during their away match to Fiorentina, they picked up a 3-0 loss and with it, lost any real chances of taking the league this season. Simeone was sensational for Fiorentina, scoring all three goals and crushing Napoli's dreams in the process.
Trotta 
Crotone have had a really tough season, fighting the relegation zone for the majority of it and never did they really look like they were a team who could stay up. Football however, is a magical game, and with yet another win on the weekend, survival is looking like a real possibility. Crotone were hosts to Sassuolo, and with the match ending 4-1, both Simy and Trotta picked up two goals each. If we see an inform, it could go either way, but our selection is with Trotta who played on the wing.
Revell
Back across to England now, where we take a look at League 2. Now there were 2 hat-tricks present this weekend, one from McNulty (Coventry) and another from Revell (Stevenage). The fact that McNulty already has an inform, and EA's selection process, we opted with Revell here. Stevenage beat Exeter 3-1, and with him scoring all the goals, there is a fantastic chance he makes the lineup.
Edouard 
Our final selection this week sees us heading across to Scotland, where we find the biggest match in Scottish football. Celtic were at home to Rangers for the Old Firm derby, and although many were hoping for a tightly fought contest, it was all one-way traffic. Celtic picked up a comfortable 5-0 win, and Edouard was the man behind 2 goals, while also providing an assist for the third."
RATINGS REFRESH - BUNDESLIGA & LIGUE 1,24-Jan-18 14:24,"Bundesliga:
Next up with our predictions we head over to Germany and the Bundesliga. While we see some solid upgrades across the board, the list below showing potential downgrades is definitely even more suprising! 

Hummels +1 Upgrade
With 19 games played in the Bundesliga and just 14 goals conceded by Bayern, it will probably come as no surprise to see them atop the table, 16 points clear of second place. Now while a great team will usually have prolific goals scorers, it is also critical that they are built from the back with a solid defensive line. Hummels is the man who leads this line and with the success both he and Bayern have enjoyed this season, a +1 boost seems only logical. 

Werner +1 Upgrade
This 21-year-old German striker started to make a name for himself last year after helping Leipzig shoot up the Bundesliga table and qualify for Champions League football. Moving into the current year and it seems like this youngster is still a long way off his full potential, with 10 goals and 3 assists from just 16 appearances so far. After receiving his huge upgrade this year of an 82-rated card, it looks likely that just 6 months later EA could be boosting it once more, moving Werner up to that special 83 rating. 

Naldo +2 Upgrade
While Bayern seem to have run away with the league again this year, just one-point separates 2nd and 7th place in the Bundesliga. Thanks to consistently solid displays from the likes of Naldo at the back, Schalke sit in third place and in serious contention for a Champions League spot. It's clear just how solid he has been as a center back, but when we also look at the 4 goals, 2 assists and multiple motm awards he has picked up, anybody can understand why a +2 upgrade could be on the cards. 

Goretzka +1 Upgrade 
Hype surrounding this German youngster has been off the charts for the past couple of years, and this winter transfer window, where he has secured himself a summer move to Bayern, has only added to the hype! With 4 goals from just 9 starts this season, Goretzka shows that he can not only dominate the midfield, but also find the back of the net when the opportunity is present. A +1 boost is all we are expect now, but watch out for this guy in FIFA 19! 

Kimmich +3 Upgrade
Over the past few years, this 22-year-old German right back has simply gone from strength to strength. Every single area of his game seems to be filled with talent, determination and success, whether defensively or going forward. Kimmich has not only been solid defensively, but has also provided numerous assists this season and even found the back of the net a fair few times. With 3 special cards already released this year, a +3 upgrade seems absolutely correct here. 

Coman +3 Upgrade 
With the likes of Ribery and Robben available for those winger positions and at the young age of just 21, it was always going to be difficult for this Frenchman to break into Bayern's starting eleven. However, despite the mountain ahead of him, this seems to be exactly what Coman has achieved, starting 9 games and coming on as a substitute in another 8. While he may have only scored twice this season, his presence and contribution go a lot deeper than goals, and therefore a +3 upgrade is fully deserved. 

Bailey +5 Upgrade
The final mention from the Bundesliga sees us talking about the Jamaican left midfielder from Bayer Leverkusen. With 7 goals, 5 assists and 3 man of the match awards already this season, Bailey has shown just how valuable he is to this Bundesliga team. While we have talked about many rating boosts from 1-3 points, this guy gets a huge increase from 76 all the way up to 81 and its hard to argue against it. 
 
Upgrades

 
Downgrades

 
 
Ligue 1:
For our second league today, we head over to France and the Ligue 1. Some huge names are once again on the list to receive an upgrade, however the number of players likely to be upgraded, who have a special card so far, really seems to be lacking! 

Cavani +1 Upgrade
Since Ibrahimović moved on from PSG the other year, Cavani has finally been given his chance to lead the line and show exactly what he is capable of. With an attacking trio of himself, Neymar and Mbappe, it is no surprise that PSG are flying this season, but when we look at Cavani's contribution of 3 assists and 20 goals, we see just how important this man really is. 

Fabinho +1 Upgrade
Monaco currently sit fourth in Ligue 1, 10 points behind the leaders but just 2 points behind second place Lyon. While their attacking stats have been solid, their defensive ones are equally impressive having conceded the second least amount of goals in the league. Fabinho plays a large part in both areas, holding down the midfield while creating opportunities going forward too. A boost of +1 seems very fitting on this occasion. 

Marquinhos +1 Upgrade
We move back to league leaders PSG once more here, but this time we look at their defensive setup. While Thiago Silva could potentially be getting a downgrade, the younger Brazilian center back could be moving the other way. PSG have been sensational going forward, but we cannot disregard just how important their back line have been too. Marquinhos has been at the heart of this and a +1 upgrade may very well be on the cards. 

Mbappe +1 Upgrade 

After a mega money move in the summer, 19-year-old Mbappe joined PSG with the entire world wondering just what this youngster was capable of. Proving all doubters wrong and showing that he was worth every penny, Mbappe has already bagged himself 9 goals in the league this season and has another 8 assists to his name. A +1 boost right now seems correct, but can you imagine what this guy could be capable of in a few years' time? 

Thauvin +1 Upgrade
Marseille currently sit third in the table with just a mere point separating them from second place Lyon. Thauvin has been critical to their success so far, assisting 8 goals and scoring a further 10 himself. This is one of those players that you simply expect to receive an upgrade, and moving up from 82 to 83 seems extremely fitting. 

Fekir +2 Upgrade
With the goal scoring stats provided by this 24-year-old Frenchman, it would surprise many people that he is not actually, a striker. From a central attacking midfield role, he has already found the back of the net 16 times and assisted another 5 in Ligue 1 alone, propelling Lyon into second place within the league. A +2 upgrade is the very least this man deservers, and if his season continues in this manner we could be seeing a fantastic base card in FIFA 19.

REVIEW - TOTS DOUGLAS COSTA,28-May-18 07:00,"Another week, another TOTS release, and this time FUT Managers were treated to a two for one special.  The Ligue 1 and the Serie A (that’s right I said it) TOTS players boast some serious firepower for sure.  They also boast some serious price tags and so I tried to review an affordable player with a considerable upside.  In the end I decided that TOTS Douglas Costa was the perfect mix of price and performance while offering easy links to hybrids as well.  I tested this card over 20 games of Weekend League in order to gain a sense of his abilities against the best squads and players in FUT.
I continued to roll with a 4-2-2-2 formation and I used Costa either as a LF/RT ST or the RIGHT CAM throughout the weekend.  In selecting a chemistry style I wanted to boost Costa’s 82 FINISHING, which is quite poor for an end game player.  However, after applying the SNIPER style Costa receives a +15 FINISHING BOOST moving him to 97 FINISHING, much better.  Costa was the cruise missile in the following squad (switched with Salah for 10 games at ST as well):

 
PACE
At 99 ACCELERATION and 94 SPRINT SPEED at only 5’6 you know you are getting a speed demon.  At this point in FUT there are so many players boasting these levels of speed.  However, I think all FUT Managers can agree that there are certain players who can truly pull away from opponents, and those that are just quick.  Costa was definitely in the first category and gave my opponents serious issues if they wanted to chase back controlling their midfielders.  Costa is like the Road Runner, just out of reach of the flailing Wile E. Coyote trying so hard to catch up, but always so far away.
RATING: 5/5
 
SHOOTING
Maybe it is the way I approach the ball when shooting, or the angle I hold the stick, or maybe even the camera angle?  But for me, left footed players in FUT are the best at opening up and curling the ball into the far corner.  Costa was no different and I scored quite a few goals in this manner and goalies just couldn’t cope.  The problem is that Costa’s 3 STAR WEAK FOOT feels more like a 1 star weak foot and intelligent defenders keep you onto his right foot, very similar to all of the versions of Salah.  Even more disappointing is Costa’s finishing, which did not feel like it was 97 rated during the weekend.  By my notes, Costa should have scored 6 more goals this weekend and that is only counting clear scoring chances.  Quite disappointing.
RATING: 3.5/5
 
DRIBBLING & PASSING
In a previous review I mentioned that players with pace always have a high pass completion rate for me.  They pull away from midfielders and move defenders, which ultimately opens up passing lanes.  I would 100% put Costa in this category and say that his pace pulls opponents defenders way out of position and this led to many of his assists this weekend.  It doesn’t hurt that Costa has ALL 90+ PASSING stats except for 86 LONG PASSING.  So you know that all of the passes are going where you want.  Furthermore, Costa’s dribbling is insane and with the SNIPER chem style applied he moves to a base stat of 99 DRIBBLING.  Costa looks like he has Velcro attached to his foot and the ball just follows him around.  He simply pulls it away from would be defenders and they Charlie Brown into the air and Costa skips on by.   The speed that he takes his touch out of the dribble is also amazing and took me a few matches to get used to, but after that it opened up shooting and passing lanes for me throughout the weekend.
PASSING RATING: 5/5
DRIBBLING RATING: 5/5
 
DEFENDING & PHYSICAL
While I don’t think FUT Managers would be purchasing Costa in hopes of a defensive powerhouse or a midfield juggernaut, I will still point out that Costa is definitely not either of these.  I have seen smaller midfielders with pace deployed in defensive positions with amazing success.  Raheem Sterling for instance is like a rabid squirrel hunting down opponents causing havoc all game long.  Costa is definitely not like this and has zero defensive qualities to add to your squad.  From the Physical standpoint it does appear that Costa has some hidden stats.  Players such as TOTS Alejandro Gomez show strength on the ball despite his 52 STRENGTH rating and Costa does the same at only 76 STRENGTH.  He feels significantly stronger on the ball which was a nice addition to the squad.  The final comment I would make is on the 90 STAMINA that Costa possess.  Around the 70th minute of every match I noted a significant drop off in Costa’s output.  He seemed slower, weaker, and could not keep up with other players in my squad.   This was a frustration in that I wasn’t using a sub to change the game and instead was wasting a sub because Costa was no longer effective.  Small complaint, but still worth noting.
DEFENDING RATING: 1.5/5
PHYSICAL RATING: 3.5/5
 
FINAL SCORE
RATING: 3.9/5
With the FUT Market continuing to dip as we approach the World Cup mode the value for coins conversation has changed.  As of this writing TOTS Douglas Costa is 310k on the XBOX market and by the time this review is released he could be into the 200k price mark.  At 200-230k I would say that this card is absolutely value for coins.  Opponents cannot handle the pace that Costa brings to the team and if you enjoy dribbling this card will bring you a great deal of joy.  On his left foot Costa can produce magic and if you enjoy these types of players you will be extremely satisfied.  However, at 300-330k you are getting the exact same qualities… and that is it.  In my opinion at this point in FUT it takes a very special card to be worth 300k+ and Costa does not tic enough boxes to reach these “very special” levels.
Cheers for Reading!

FUT FM EPISODE 50,12-May-18 07:12,"Hey comrades, welcome to a very special FUT FM. It’s our 50th episode AND it comes at the heels of the FIFA 18 World Cup announcement. Exciting!
Let’s jump into the show:


 
FIFA 18 World Cup Update Explained

We’re thrilled that EA have announce the return of the beloved World Cup mode!
It’ll be out on May 28th as a free add on for FIFA 18, and every World Cup team will be in the game. That means you’ll finally be able to play with nations like Serbia and Croatia! Every tournament stadium is licensed as well.
Furthermore, the players from the World Cup squads will be available in a new FUT mode, along with brand new Icons. As a result, the chemistry system will be a little different.
Players from the same nation will have strong links, and players from the same confederation will have weak links.

The new FIFA 18 FUT World Cup mode will not have a transfer market, and it’ll share your coins from the core game. As a small bonus, every time you open a World Cup pack, you’ll get a free corresponding pack in the base game.
EA have also confirmed that the World Cup mode will have a new system to deal with duplicates, along with SBCS. They’ve also confirmed that you can take non qualified nations into the World Cup (this is presumably base game functionality).
Both of us are pretty excited for this mode in FIFA 18! Although we don’t expect gameplay to be updated in any way, it’ll be nice to go back to lower rated teams for a while.
With so many powerful cards in FUT, there’s not much room for creativity on the pitch and when it comes to squad building. Although there’s plenty to learn from how great players play with these super powered teams, it takes a different kind of approach to be successful with more modest squads.
So although there are no planned gameplay changes, we’ll definitely see a different meta.
 
Easiest TOTS Ever?

With the ability to get TOTS players from daily objectives, DKTs, and a perfectly fair SBC for the Premier League, this TOTS is shaping up to be the most giving one to date.
Although this year’s game introduced many new coin sinks, it’s still good to be able to get some of the best players in the game for relatively cheap. Even if the likes of TOTS 86 Ben Davies won’t be in your starting 11, it’s still good SBC fodder.
For example, our own Goran was able to get Prime Icon Del Piero very easily after grabbing a few TOTS cards.
We hope that this trend continues with FIFA promos in the future. We can’t expect to get awesome cards for cheap all the time, but it definitely helps to pepper them out throughout the year. Plus, it keeps the game exciting and fresh!

MARQUEE MATCHUPS,19-Jan-18 10:41,"Valencia vs Real Madrid
First up this week we head over to La Liga where last year's Champions League winners, Real Madrid, are having an absolute nightmare of a season so far. With Madrid currently 19 points off league leaders and rivals Barcelona, they travel to third place Valencia, really needing all the points. While not a derby per say, with Champions League spots currently so tight, both teams head into this match really needing the points, which instantly adds importance to the match. Investing in this match is nice and simple, with an excess of gold players available for both sides simply ensure you consider other factors such as position, rating and rarity. 

AC Milan vs Lazio
Flying across to Italy for our second selection of the week where we find a struggling AC Milan playing hosts to fourth place Lazio. Just like La Liga, competition for Champions League spaces is really heating up and moving into the second half of the season Lazio plan on continuing their solid form while AC Milan will be desperately trying to undo some of the damage done before Christmas. Just like before, investments are nice and simple with an abundance of gold players available for both sides. 

Marseille vs AS Monaco
Over to France now where we find third place OM play hosts to fourth place AS Monaco in a heated battle at the top end of the table. With just a point separating these two sides, a win for either team will see them jump ahead and secure themselves that all important third place spot, qualifying them for the Champions League, well at least for a week! Investments here remain nice and simple, plenty of gold options and hence no need to panic. 

Melbourne Victory vs Sydney FC
Our fourth pick this week sees us flying half way across the world, down to Australia where Melbourne Victory play hosts to Sydney FC. According to Wikipedia, this match has more significance than you may assume. Known as ""The Big Blue"" or also ""The City Derby"", the rivalry stems back to one forged between Melbourne and Sydney, however the information that both teams play in blue is where I believe the real issues lie! Investments here are ideally picked up nice and quickly, silvers for minimum are ideal however if this becomes impossible, never be afraid to turn your attention to the bronze players available.  

KAA Gent vs Club Brugge
For the next match we come back to Europe, and head towards Belgium where KAA Gent play hosts to Club Brugge in a match known as ""The Battle of Flanders"".  Club Brugge comfortably sit atop the table on 53 points, with Gent currently 19 points behind with 32. The table suggests the match can only go one way, however these sorts of matches can often offer a pleasant surprise to the neutral spectators. Investments here again are fairly simple as both sides have enough gold players to go around. 

Birmingham vs Sunderland
For our final pick this week we head over to England where we find bottom of the table Sunderland travelling to second from bottom Birmingham in an extremely important relegation battle match. Now usually we see games picked based off rivalries, derbies or simply top teams, but if the bottom two sides going head to head in a must win match isn't worthy of the marquee matchup's title, then I lose all hope. This match is definitely more of a gamble, and hence being smart with what your spending is critical. Gold cards, silver cards or even bronze for discard is fantastic, the higher you being spending, the more risk you knowingly undertake."
REVIEW - The WorldCup Chimera,04-Jun-18 07:39,"The World Cup Mode is here, the hype is real, the pack weight is fantastic, the FUT market is destroyed, and we are all going insane.  In terms of reviews I was torn on how I wanted to write them during the World Cup Mode.  FUT Managers cannot simply go and purchase the players I review if they like what they hear.  With that in mind I have decided that each World Cup Mode review will contain a brief overview of three different players in hopes that FUT Managers can benefit from my experiences.  These ratings will be based on player levels in the World Cup Mode and not compared to the end game players that exist in FUT.  
My initial fear was that I would struggle to get players worth reviewing as I was not interested in spending many coins…. then I opened my starter pack, spent 50k coins, opened my ICON pack, and a monster was born.  My starter pack contained Thiago (a player I have never used in FUT before) and I was immediately disappointed considering all of the Messi, Neymar, and Ronaldo pulls I was reading about, but I was hoping there were better things to come.  After some uninspiring pulls I completed the ICON SBC and all was forgiven as Lothar Matthäus joined the squad.  I started putting together a hybrid of my best pulls and soon realized that I would have to start with a European squad and a 4-1-4-1 formation was the only way to make them fit.  I threw Renato Sanches into the mix as an afterthought and a throwback to FIFA 17; my squad was complete:

 
As I said before this team was amazing for me and I can’t get over how lucky the mixture of players I pulled were.  I was not exaggerating that a monster was born with this squad; and that monster was in my midfield.  In Greek Mythology there is a creature called a Chimera: A lion like creature, with the head of a goat emerging from the back, and a king cobra for a tail.  The fact that this creature is sometimes considered female is even more scary (don’t tell my wife I said this).


 
Thiago Alcántara: The King Cobra
RATING: 4/5
Starting with the tail; Thiago lined up in the defensive CM position of the 4-1-4-1 and for some unknown reason I didn’t change the formation in game; in fact I didn’t change the player instructions or player positions either, I just played.  Thiago just patrolled the pocket in front of my backline and disrupted everything my opponent could throw at me.  His stats don’t suggest a defensive juggernaut, but time and time again he was intercepting passes and starting me the other way on the counter attack.  His pace would normally be an issue, but in this case everything was in front of him and he always had just enough quickness to strike down attacks.  When he breaks up play his amazing dribbling stats allow him to slither his way through opponents and get the ball forward.  His passing is insane and I can imagine he could be a threat in a more advanced CM position as well.  I did manage a few long shots that he can hit with some real venom, but for the most part he remained further back.  Really impressed with this card and for any FUT managers discouraged by packing him, he is worth a go.
 
Lothar Matthäus: The GOAT
RATING 4.8/5
The title speaks for itself; Matthäus is another player that I have not had the pleasure of using in past versions of FUT, and if he is anything like he is in World Cup Mode, then I have obviously been missing out.  He absolutely melted my opponents in the midfield and was the link to my striker in every game.  I know that I would have been changing my formation immediately if it was not for Matthäus and without him I would not have had the success I have enjoyed so far.  He runs, and runs, and runs at a pace that other midfielders cannot cope with, especially later in the match.  You only have to look at his stats to know that this card is a game changer; all 80/90+ BASE STATS and a 4 STAR WEAK FOOT make Matthäus the complete package.  There may be better attacking options in the midfield positions for World Cup Mode, but as an all-around beast this guy is the GOAT.
 
Renato Sanches: The Lion
RATING 4.3/5
No, I haven’t lost my mind with this rating, and no I don’t have 100 Renato Sanches’ in my trade pile waiting to sell J. Without Renato Sanches this monster would not have been complete.  You have Matthäus destroying opponents left and right, Thiago poisoning would be attacks, and then you have Sanches and his beautiful mane ripping opponents to shreds.  Time and time again during the Online Tournament I would need a timely goal, a last second tackle, a block in the box, or someone to take control of the game; time and time again that person was Renato Sanches.  He is back baby (like FIFA 17 back I swear).  Granted, I used him at the start of FIFA 18 when I was scraping for coins and he was good then, just not Bakayoko good.  However, with the style of this World Cup Mode it is like he was made for this gameplay and vice versa.  If you have a European squad, and you scroll through and this guy is sitting in your club, you have to try him.  Beyond his 4 STAR WEAK FOOT there is nothing about his stats that screams game changer and in fact his stats probably suggest the opposite.  But I stand by my rating and if you watch my video you will see him delivering once again in the World Cup Final, in injury time, to bring me to the ultimate glory. This lion does not sleep!
Cheers for reading.

The Anticipated Return of AirJapes,23-Feb-18 07:38,"Hey comrades, welcome to the 39th FUT FM, featuring FIFA legend AirJapes. It’s been a while since he’s been on, and we want to give him a big thanks for a lovely chat!
Unfortunately Goran (drpoplove) had to sit out on this episode, so Nelly (nellygotbored) takes over hosting duties and, well… maybe forgets the format of the show.
Sorry Nelly, we still love you though. <3
This week we take a long hard look at the design of FIFA Ultimate Team, debate what the actual gameplay should reward, and so much more. Let’s get to it!
 

 
Quickly Circling Back On The 433 False 9

Last week, we brought up the 433 False 9 and questioned why it was so ineffective in high level play.
Although people have suggested many reasons, ranging from the ease of passing to absurdly high attributes on super powered in form cards, at the end of the day, it just leaves you exposed too often.
Compared to the more meta formations, the 433 is not reliable enough defensively.
And as Japes points out, you need a truly stacked team to make it work in attack in  FIFA 18. That brings us to our next point...
 
Does FIFA Ultimate Team Need To Be Redesigned?
 

 
With the new animation system in place and generally harder defending, there’s never been a bigger gap between Gold Players and In Forms/Icons.
As one of the consequences of this, it would seem that less and less people are playing/enjoying FUT Champs.
Between the FUT FM crew and Japes, we have amassed several decades of collective FIFA experience, and all of us agree that the power creep has gotten out of hand. It’s getting impossible to enjoy the Weekend League unless you have a hyper upgraded team, which of course means that you have spend to a huge amount of time playing.
Or that you spend a lot of real world money.
On the other hand, you should expect the likes of a 96 card to destroy an 81 player any day of the week. But how do you make that balanced and fun?
It’s a tough nut to crack, but a Hearthstone-style duplicate system could help level the playing field. Or perhaps a draft and ban system is needed, similar to the likes of LoL or Heroes Of The Storm.
Either way, striking more of a balance would require a major revamp of FUT’s mechanics.
If you could make one major change to how FUT works, what would you do? Let us know on Twitter. Or let us know if it should stay exactly how it is!
With the amount of highly visible FIFA pros and content creators leaving the scene, it might be be time time for change.
 
Should FIFA Reward Football IQ Or AI Mastery?

All sports games have to assist you in many ways. After all, you’re only controlling 1 player most of the time.
But the thing is… most successful competitive games take out as much of the AI element as possible. You can’t really do that in FIFA, outside of the Pro Clubs mode. As long as 1v1 is the primary focus, the AI will have to be a part of the flow.
As Japes and Valerio debate in this episode, there’s a real divide between how much the AI should help you out.
For example, the casual player needs to be able to pick up the game and have through balls work in order to create goal scoring chances. But then for the hardcore player, it can get frustrating when the defender auto lunges and misses the through ball interception all of the time.
On the flip side, if you make through balls too manual, the casual player (the most common player) will not have a good time.
Like with the FUT redesign point, the question is, how do you balance all of this?
Maybe the answer here is to have less AI assistance for the Weekend League, similar to how Madden has a setting to reduce RNG. But is that even truly feasible?
The casual player wants to log in and have a blast, but the hardcore player wants to compete.
Which side of the debate are you on? Or do you have a different idea of what FIFA should be rewarding? Give us a shout on Twitter.
 
The Potential Effect Of The EU General Data Protection Regulation On FIFA
 

The European Union is updating its internet privacy laws in about 3 months to accommodate the the current state of the internet.
The EU GDPR looks like it will fundamentally change how how we handle and process data, and it’s safe to speculate that similar laws will be adopted in other regions over the next few years.


One of the more FIFA-relevant aspects of the GDPR is that the data collection company should be telling you how and why it’s using your data. It’ll be interesting to see if this translates into generic “hey we are taking your data to
enrich your experience” disclaimers, or if companies will be forced into revealing more details.
Of course, over the years it’s become clear that game companies and marketers use all available data they can to encourage more online spending. So maybe we’ll finally get a clear answer on how packs work, and whether all of the rumors of them changing weights based on your behavior are true or not.
After all, EA’s VP of Engineering has stated that the company can alter the game experience as they see fit:
EA Digital Employees Present, ""A Day In The Life""

Thanks for listening to FUT FM and reading this article, we’ll be back next week with another special guest, cheers!

MARQUEE MATCHUPS,11-May-18 14:05,"With the season coming to a close, we are seeing more and more cup finals featuring each week. Now we have already seen that EA like to include this in current marquee matchup’s, and so, today’s predictions will feature a mix of both cup games and domestic matches.
 
Marseille vs Atletico Madrid
For our first selection, it only makes sense to target the biggest game of the week. Marseille and Atletico Madrid go head to head in the Europa Cup final, and with both teams only narrowly winning their semi-final clashes, we can expect an incredibly close final. Investments here are simple, Gold Players should be our target, however with so many cards inflated, be careful with what you pay.
 
Manchester United vs Chelsea
Next up we head over to England, where Manchester United and Chelsea face off in the FA Cup final. While it looks like Chelsea will miss out on top 4, and Manchester United without a trophy this season, suddenly this game becomes even more important for both the clubs. Again, be careful with prices, rating and positions when investing here.
 
Aves vs Sporting
Onto the third and final cup selection this week, where Aves and Sporting meet in the Taca de Portugal final. Sporting head into this as strong favourites, however the magic and madness of a cup final, can bring out the absolute best in players, and upsets are far from uncommon. We should have a wide variety of golds to choose from once again, just ensure you watch those prices!
 
Villarreal vs Real Madrid
Over to Spain now and while Real Madrid have a Champions League final to excite the fans, their League form has been far below expectations this year. Villarreal sit in 6th and Madrid in 3rd, and with European spots available for both sides, this game could really pack a punch. The only concern I have here, is the Champions League final and the likelihood of some sort of SBC around this. Personally I would avoid due to this, however picking up a few players just in case, couldn’t hurt.
 
Lazio vs Inter Milan
As far as big league matches go, this one couldn’t get any bigger. Lazio currently sit in fourth with 71 points, while Inter Milan fall just below them in fifth, with 69. With just two games remaining and a fourth and final Champions League spit up for grabs, the winner of this match puts themselves in a fantastic position. Once again, plenty of golds available to invest in here, just be mindful of position, rating and rarity.
 
Hammarby vs AIK
Over to Sweden now, where we find first place Hammarby facing off against second place AIK. Not only does the winner of this match claim the top spot, but there is also a historical rivalry due to their Stockholm location. Investments should be bought for discard here in order to reduce any risks.
 
Limerick vs Cork
It’s always great to include one of those “wildcard” matches, one of those games that could provide a massive profit if included. Limerick and Cork ticks this box, there is relevance due to their history, and the Munster Derby could provide us that win. Cork sit atop the table and Limerick in 9th, and while there isn’t much to play for, we have investments to make. We shouldn’t be paying anything above discard here, aim for silvers if possible, but if not, bronze will be fine."
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,31-Mar-18 05:59,"We come back from the International break and find ourselves with a whole heap of potential candidates for this week’s nominations. This time last year we saw EA drop European MM alongside the normal one and hence it is important for us to consider this possibility when deciding on where / who to invest in.

Manchester City vs Manchester United
First up this week we head over to England where we find ourselves with two possible fixtures. The Manchester Derby If our first choice and although City have practically won the league, the race for second is still live and hence both teams are going to be ready to rumble. Investments here are simple and have the potential to rocket (like Juventus this week), keep in mind that we may see a European MM too and hence City Players carry that double value! O and we have the possible use for league SBC’s too!

Everton vs Liverpool
Our second match sees us travelling about 30 minutes up the road where we find Everton and Liverpool going head to head in the Merseyside Derby. Now we already mentioned the bonus of picking up City Players over United and this same logic carries across to Liverpool, City’s Champions League opponents. Just ensure you remain smart and aim for discard on players you pick up.

Real Madrid vs Atlético Madrid
Next up we head over to Spain where we find Real Madrid playing hosts to Atlético Madrid in a match known as, well it’s fairly obvious, it’s the Madrid Derby! Now you may have seen the pattern here, these first few choices all have double value down to European matches and if we see EA go down this route, we are already prepared! We also have the bonus of a league SBC use too!

Roma vs Fiorentina
Over to Italy now where we find aroma playing hosts to Fiorentina and yet again another double sided investment. Roma are still in Europe so aiming for gold players here at around discard price is a no risk investment that ticks multiple boxes.

CSKA Moscow vs Dynamo Moscow
Over to Russia next where CSKA Moscow play hosts to Dynamo Moscow in what could only be described as a Moscow Derby! Investments for this are nice and simple, we should have enough gold players to go around and discard prices shouldn’t be too much of an issue either.

Al Ahli vs Al Hilal
Over to Saudi Arabia now where second place Al Ahil are playing hosts to first place Al Hilal. Only a single point separates the two sides and hence the victor of this match will claim the number one spot in the league. Now while we have a small amount of gold players available, don’t be afraid to jump on board the silver or even bronze train, hype should help you gain a sizeable profit in the build up either way.

Atletico Nacional vs Independiente Medellin
Colombia next and we find Nacional playing hosts to Independiente in a match known as El Clasico Paisa. These two teams have the privilege of sharing the Atanasio Girardot stadium, with a capacity of 40,000 and hence where the real rivalry lies. Finding gold cards will prove difficult so with those silvers and bronzes just aim for discard.

FC Zurich vs Grasshopper Club Zürich
Over to Switzerland next where we find FC Zürich playing hosts to Grasshopper in a match known as the Zürich Derby. According to Wikipedia, this match is a big one in Switzerland due to the fact it is the only rivalry that takes place between two clubs from the same city. Investments are likely to feature around silver and bronze players so just ensure you aim for discard.

Suwon Samsung Bluewings vs FC Seoul
Our final match is another long shot and sees us heading over to South Korea where Suwon play hosts to Seoul in a match known as the Super Match. It came about due to a rivalry between both clubs from the Seoul capital area and is regarded as the biggest in South Korea. Investments are going to be silver and bronze once again, but this kind of game should return a sizeable win off hype alone."
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,10-Mar-18 07:58,"Marseille vs Lyon
First up this week we head over to France where we find Olympique de Marseille playing hosts to Olympique Lyonnais in a derby known as “Choc de Olympiques”. Investments here are nice and straight forward, both teams have plenty of gold players available, so we want to be looking at the best rating possible for discard prices.

Villarreal vs Atletico Madrid
Over to the La Liga now where we find a match between 5th place Villarreal and 2nd place Atletico Madrid. While this match may not be a derby, we have seen EA include a whole heap of games between top tier clubs and with the lack of a La Liga fixture in the past week, this has an outside chance. This being said, games like these are usually less likely to feature and while it may be worth grabbing a handful of players, this doesn’t feel like an “all-in” kind of fixture.

Porto vs Boavista
Portugal is our next stop, where we find Porto playing hosts to Boavista in a derby known as “Derby Da Invicta”. Both sides originate from the same area and while Porto is a much larger club, matches like these are often fuelled by desire and fully capable of providing an upset! Investments here should be nice and simple again, plenty of gold players around, just ensure you aim for discard prices!

Fenerbahce vs Galatasaray
Over to Turkey now where we find 4th place Fenerbahçe playing hosts to top of the table Galatasaray. Not only does this match hold significance due to their current league standings, but it also ticks the box for being a massive derby. The “Intercontinental Derby” is the name given to the fixture between these two sides and is also known as the “Eternal Rivalry” featuring the two most successful sides in the league. Plenty of golds available once again, you guys know what to do!

Basaksehir vs Besiktas
Staying in the Super Lig now where we find 2nd place Basaksehir playing hosts to 3rd place Besiktas. Like we mentioned before, games towards the top of the table often creep into the SBC and with everything to play for, this match certainly fits the bill. Investments here are nice and simple again, plenty of golds, just be smart. Keep in mind that we have two suggestions from this league and only one can feature!

Poznan vs Gdansk
Over to Poland now where we finally find a match with a whole load of potential. Poznan play hosts to Gdańsk in this rivalry, and the bonus we have here is the distinct lack of gold players available. This isn’t a league we see feature often and with the majority of players being silver or bronze, we have plenty of potential f we are buying at discard. Same rules apply here as usual, buy for discard and sell into the hype for safety.

Limerick vs Cork
Our final selection this week sees us heading over to Ireland where we find 7th place Limerick play hosts to top of the table Cork. This derby goes by the name of the “Munster Derby” and has to be my personal favourite of the week. Investing here should be done as close to discard as possible and while prices may rocket if included, selling into the hype provides that safety net and ensures you some profit at least!"
TOTW26 Predictions,12-Mar-18 14:05,"Starting Eleven
Cech 
Our first prediction this week is most likely one that will anger and upset a large portion of the community, not because he is undeserving, but because of who will miss out if this comes true. Arsenal were at home to Watford for the Sunday fixture and during a comfortable 3-0 win, both Aubameyang and Mkhitaryan (those two names together become a nightmare for spelling) picked up an assist and a goal each. The problem is that this isn't for a first inform and hence EA usually require a little bit more, Cech however has had no special cards this year, he kept a clean sheet and saved a penalty as well, it could be his day.
Hugo 
Now this is a selection that is almost too perfect and one that everybody will be pleased to see happen. Fiorentina were at home to Benevento for their Serie A fixture and in an incredibly tight game, it was the hosts who managed to edge out a 1-0 victory. After the tragic news regarding Astori last week, to see his defensive partner and friend, Hugo, keep a clean sheet and score the winning goal, is the perfect tribute and almost feels like this had to happen.
Manolas 
Roma were hosts to Torino in an incredibly important game towards the top of the Serie A and this time it was Roma who stole the show. In a comfortable 3-0 victory Nainggolan gave himself a real shout for a second inform with 2 assists and a solid performance throughout, however our selection goes with Manolas. A clean sheet, a great game from start to finish and even a goal to his name as well!
Aurier 
We head back to the Premier League for this selection and the first of our two nominees from Tottenham. Tottenham came back from a goal behind to beat Bournemouth 4-1 on Sunday and while Aurier may not have managed a clean sheet, a goal and an assist may very well be just about enough to see him creep into the TOTW and receive his first inform of the year.
Garcia
Athletic Bilbao were hosts to Leganes for their weekend fixture and in a game of two goals, it was the hosts who took the points. Garcia, from the midfield, was absolutely sensational, scoring both goals and securing the man of the match award too.
Vela 
We head over to America now and with the MLS only having recently returned, we could already have one of our first huge informs this week. Los Angeles FC were away to Salt Lake and in a game of 6 goals, it was the away side who picked up a comfortable 5-1 win. Now Rossi scored twice and even picked up an assist, making him a fantastic candidate, however Vela picked up an assist, a goal and a perfect match rating to go alongside them which is why he edges out his teammate to make it into our predictions. Time to get grinding that DKT everyone!
Rashford 
Second place Manchester United were at home to third placed Liverpool in a winner takes all match towards the top of the Premier League. An early goal from Rashford put United ahead, and a quickfire second pretty much stuck the nail in the coffin. A fantastic performance and a real danger down the left throughout, this should be more than enough to see his PTG card finally receive an upgrade!
Son 
After scoring twice last week, Son was somehow missing from the actual TOTW, something that we as a community were not happy about. This only fueled Son to do better, score more, become super human and after an incredible performance mid-week against Juventus he then went on to score another 2 goals on the weekend against Bournemouth. In a fantastic 4-1 victory Son picked up man of the match, but with a goal and an assist for Aurier, we could very well see him creep into the mix as well.
Dybala 
As if these predictions didn’t already pack enough heat, we have a couple more superstars to bring to the table, just to ensure we end with a bang! Juventus were at home to Udinese for their Sunday fixture and in a match where Higuain missed yet another goal from the spot, a new hero was needed. Dybala was once again the man to rise to the challenge, scoring twice from the left-wing position and hopefully picking up his third inform of the year. If this happens, Dybala will have a central inform, one on the right and now one on the left, is there anywhere this youngster can't play?
Ribery 
Bayern absolutely destroyed Hamburg 6-0 when they met in the Bundesliga and although it's rare that EA include 2 players from a single club, there is simply no way we could leave either of these two out. Ribery managed to bag himself two goals from the left and on top of this he also provided a near perfect match rating for his fantastic display. While Lewandowski is likely a lock with his hat-trick, surly Ribery also deserves this acknowledgement too.
Lewandowski 
Bayern were hosts to Hamburg on Saturday and after the absolute thrashing the visitors received, they will be wishing they simply hadn't bothered making the trip! The match ended 6-0 and there were some truly fantastic performances to mention throughout. Lewandowski however simply has to make the cut, with 2 goals from open play and one from the spot, he completed his hat-trick and a second inform just has to be around the corner.
 
Substitutes
Dovbnya 
Our substitute goalkeeper this week is one that may turn heads, not due to their fantastic display, but due to the fact that he comes from a losing side. SKA-Khabarovsk were away to Spartak Moscow on Sunday and in a game that saw the hosts tally 41 shots with 12 on target, to only lose the match 1-0 is absolutely spectacular. There was a penalty save thrown into the mix along with some fantastic control of his defenders, the worst part is that the goal they conceded came in the 90th minute, what a horrible way to lose!
Fischer 
Sparta Rotterdam were away to Roda for their Eredivisie fixture on the weekend and it looks like the journey paid off. In a 2-0 victory, Fischer at the back was as solid as a rock, not only did he ensure the clean sheet was kept but he also provided one of the goals in a near perfect performance.
Ayoub
FC Utrecht were hosts to Vitesse for their Sunday fixture and in a game that brought us 6 goals, 5 of these went to the hosts. There were some fantastic performances across the board, with 4 different goal scorers for Utrecht, however only one man could possibly be placed into these predictions. With 2 goals and an assist, Ayoub from the central role was simply unstoppable throughout and a TOTW card would be totally deserved.
Nkunku 
Over to France now where league leaders PSG were hosts to the travelling Metz. Now seeing PSG comfortably picking up wins with huge score lines is nothing new and as they proceeded to destroy Metz 5-0 very few could be surprised, however seeing a name feature within these predictions that isn't already a superstar, is a refreshing change to say the least. Nkunku scored twice during this victory and while his current card may only be a 71-rated silver, we could very well be seeing a brand-new gold inform on the market this week.
Kenedy 
Newcastle were at home to Southampton towards the bottom of the Premier League and with the relegation battle really starting to heat up, both clubs desperately required a win. The hosts were ready and waiting and with just 2 minutes gone, they were already 1-0 up. The match ended 3-0 with Kenedy scoring twice, whether or not this is enough for an inform though is a completely different question.
Valente 
Matitimo were at home to Vitoria de Setubal for their fixture on the weekend and in a game consisting of 6 goals, it was the hosts who left with all 3 points after a 4-2 victory. Valente from the wing was the hero on the day, scoring twice and assisting a third to secure his position within these predictions.
Fran Sol 
Willem II were hosts to top of the table PSV for their Eredivisie game on the weekend and while the world expected a walkover, almost nobody would have predicted the team that would execute it. Willem II picked up a massive 5-0 win and while the entire team were incredible, the nomination this week has to go with the striker Sol. Scoring 3 goals, even if 2 were from the spot, should be enough to see him pick up an inform this week.
Rodrigo Moreno
With the release of all these new PTG cards, it feels like we will be seeing at least one feature every week! This week however it feels like it may be more difficult to find a player left out than find one to include! Valencia were on the road to Sevilla for their La Liga fixture and in a comfortable 2-0 win, it was Moreno who bagged both of the goals, the man of the match award and hopefully an inform as well!
Plea 
Moving back to France for this selection and luckily for me, this is probably one of the easiest and most likely TOTW nominees a person could find. Nice were away to Gunigamp on Sunday and during a game of 7 goals, it was the visitors who took all 3 points during a 5-2 victory. Plea was the man of the hour, scoring not once, not twice, not even three times, but four, yes four goals in the match.
Wood 
Burnley were on the road to a struggling and desperate West Ham on the weekend and sadly, the 3-0 loss West Ham received was the least of their problems. With issues continuing between club and supporters, they now sit just 3 points above the relegation zone and are in serious trouble. Burnley however have just equalled a club record for points within the Premier League! Wood was brought on in the 61st minute and with the game all square at 0-0, he really needed to provide something special. He did excatly this, after assisting the first he went on to score the next two and ensure his team took all the points.
Mitrovic 
Fulham were at home to Sheffield United for their midweek fixture and in a comfortable 3-0 victory, it was Mitrovic who scored twice. Now for a Championship game, seeing a striker receive an inform for just two goals is a fairly rare occurrence, but when we add this to his 90th minute winner on Saturday and his second goal in a 2-1 victory away to Preston, we have ourselves a super strong candidate!
Kone 
Dynamo Dreseden were hosts to FC Heidenheim for their Bundesliga 2 clash on the weekend and in an incredibly tight game consisting of 5 goals, it was the hosts who edged out a 3-2 win. Their striker Kone was the man of the hour, scoring all three goals, including an 83rd minute winner to wrap up the match.

eBundesliga Chat With Sky Sports Austria Editor,15-Mar-18 12:00,"Hello comrades and welcome to FUT FM Episode 42!
We’ve got exciting insight into the eBundesliga from Sky Sports Austria Editor Lukas Richter, plus we’ve got more player reviews.
Let’s jump right in!

 
The eBundesliga, A FIFA 18 Esports League Without EA

Esports have been pretty big in Austria lately, so it’s no surprise to see that the eBundesliga has been doing very well!
What’s really curious about the league is that they don’t play FUT, and they’re not directly affiliated with EA.
In fact, players play the 85 rated mode with real Austrian clubs. That’s right, everyone is 85 rated and can only perform 3 star skills, leading to a more balanced gameplay experience. However, some players do want FUT gameplay because that’s what’s most commonly played elsewhere.
Is 85 OVR and 3 star skills too limiting? Does it provide enough spectator entertainment value? Tell us what you think on Twitter.
Of course, it’s hard to balance being good at 85 gameplay and the FUT meta at the same time, so teams have set up “boot camps,” as Lukas pointed out in our interview. Some players have even gone as far as to not play FUT during their training.
There’s also no denying that playing with licensed clubs in an equal environment shines a bigger light on these teams, especially when you consider the fact that the FUT top 100 all play with very similar teams.
The eBundesliga can be a way to only generate an interest in the game, but also the real world clubs themselves.
The league has attracted many top sponsors already, and it’ll be really interesting to see where it goes from here. Will it eventually be broadcasted on TV? Will it influence some other leagues to not use FUT? Will there eventually be a formal partnership with EA?
We don’t have any of these answers right now, but it’ll be very exciting to see the eBundesliga evolve over time. It’s taken a very smooth and professional approach to esports, something that’s often overlooked by many organizations.
If you’re interested in participating, be sure to stay up to date with the official eBundesliga site, and if you want to learn even more, be sure to listen to the whole FUT FM episode at the top of the article.

David Luiz Is Still Somehow Good, Even Against FIFA 18 Icons
 

If you were to look at David Luiz’s card at face value, you could easily find better CB options.
However, after putting him through 2 Weekend Leagues in a row, he’s shown us that he can hang with the top players in FUT.
He’s 189 CM, weighs 84 kilos, and can have 91 strength with the Anchor chemistry style. This makes Luiz a physical beast, and he rarely gets outmuscled as a result. He’s also got 79/78 short/long passing, which is great for a CB and makes it super easy to start counter attacks, or surprise opponents with a threatening ball from the back.
To be fair though, his pace puts him at a severe disadvantage if we consider what a lot of upgraded FUT cards are like these days.
He’s got decent agility at 72, but you’d still want to run Luiz alongside a ball playing CB like Azpilicueta.
David Luiz can be the rock in your defence in the late stages of FIFA 18, and in his position his 76 stamina doesn’t actually matter. Again, this is if you have a ball playing CB paired with him.
So with an Anchor upgrade to his defending, pace, and physicality, David Luiz is an excellent budget option during a time in which so many teams are rocking Prime Icons and IF cards.

Prime Icon Larsson Is An Enigma

When we first signed Prime Icon Larsson, he acted like one of the best players in the game. The Swedish legend scored 17 goals in 7 division 1 matches on basic chemistry. His finesse shots were unmatched and reminiscent of FIFA 17 Jonas.
And yet somehow, all of that went away after about 10 matches.
Did his card magically get worse? Hah, probably not.
Did we face off against stronger opponents after a blistering winning stream? It’s likely.
Against great players, Larsson just doesn’t cut it in D1 and the Weekend League. His 3 star skills and 78/73 passing limit him to relying on his finishing, but his shot power and long shots limit him to being more of a poacher.
The Hawk chemistry style doesn’t help him enough, since Basic boosts his curve. And you definitely want to boost the curve of a weak shooter with great finishing if you can.
But there are just too many tradeoffs. It’s possible that Larsson is just a luxury player.
We’ll test him in one more Weekend League with Deadeye chemistry. It brings his curve to 98 so it could potentially make up for his awkward edge of the box/outside the box finesse shots.
Have you used Prime Icon Larsson successfully? Let us know how your experience was!

Liga NOS TOTS Predictions,01-May-18 15:56,"Starting Eleven
Before we jump into these, it’s important to mention the uncertainty around whether or not these leagues will receive a team of the season line-up. Either way, it’s important to celebrate these performances, and so here it is, our Liga Nos predictions!
Patricio 
Sporting currently sit third in the table, equal on points with Benfica and 5 behind league leaders Porto. While their goals scored isn’t quite on par with the other two, their goals conceded certainly is. With just 22 conceded all year and an average of 2.5 saves a game, Patricio secures his spot in these predictions.
Telles 
As mentioned above, Porto sit comfortable atop the table and a win in either of their final 2 matches will wrap up the league. With 79 goals scored and just 17 conceded, it’s no surprise they are leading the race, and Telles has been a fundamental part of both the offence and defence. With 3 goals, 13 assists and 7 man of the match awards, excluding this man would be nothing short of a travesty.
Jardel 
Benfica have had an amazing season so far, sitting in second and while it looks unlikely they will catch Porto, they have put up one hell of a fight. Jardel has been an absolute rock across the entire season, defensively fantastic while also contributing 2 goals and 3 assists with the attack. Surely he has done enough to earn his spot.
Felipe 
We have already touched on just how solid Porto have been this season, and Felipe has been at the core of it all. With just 17 conceded all year, and 3 goals to his name, Felipe has rightfully Darby his spot amongst the elite.
R.Pereira 
We have already spoken about just how incredible Porto’s defence has been this year, and it’s no surprise to see another featuring from the starting eleven. Pereira has been incredible across the season, defensively sound and with 2 goals, 4 assists and 3 man of the match awards, he secures his space in the starting eleven.
Carvalho 
Sporting currently sit third in the league and while their attack and defence have both been incredible, this man has been the glue that holds everything together. Defensively, he is solid as a rock, while when needed he can also be the start of a dangerous attack. Year after year we see him feature, and it’s no surprise to see it happen once again.
B.Fernandes 
From one Sporting midfielder to another now, and Fernandes has had an incredible season to date. With 11 goals and 8 assists to his name, he has directly played a part in roughly 33% of Sporting’s league goals this season and with his never-ending stamina and incredible work-rates, this man cannot he ignored.
Brahimi 
Straight back to the league leaders now, where we find a man who has once again been fantastic this year. Now while he may not stand out for goals and assists alone, his contribution to the team is always visible and he has been a critical part of their championship push. With 8 goals, 7 assists and 4 man of the match awards, Brahimi has surely secured his spot in these predictions.
Martins
From one side of the pitch to the other now, and Martins from Sporting, takes this spot. Just like Brahimi his contribution can not be ignored, and his 8 goals and 7 assists show just how much of a danger he can be going forward as well.
Dost
The myth, the man, the legend. It’s everybody’s favourite player to pack, and once again his form this season has been incredible. Out of the 62 goals scored by Sporting this season, Dost has been behind 29 of them. Having scored a massive 26 himself, he has also provided 3 assists and secured himself 7 man of the match awards. This guy is nailed on!
Jonas 
Our final player in the starting eleven is the only man in the league with a more impressive record that Dost. From Benfica’s 79 goals scored, Jonas was behind 39 of them. With 33 scored himself, 6 assists and 11 man of the match awards, you are going to struggle to find anyone more nailed on for a blue card this year.

MARQUEE MATCHUPS,23-Feb-18 08:17,"For the past few weeks there has been an overwhelming abundance of options for marquee matchup selections, however moving into this week we are simply overwhelmed with potential candidates. 
Now while EA might like to throw curveballs that make no sense and include games with no reason to be selected, we will stick to what usually works and take a look at the biggest games from around the world.

Arsenal vs Manchester City & Manchester City vs Chelsea
First up we head over to the Premier League where the leaders, Manchester City, have two incredibly tough games over the space of a few days. When we couple this with the cup final the weekend before and the upcoming Champions League fixtures as well, it’s a tough period to say the least. Obviously we have three possible investments here, however Manchester City players cover both games and hence remain the safest option by far.

AC Milan vs Inter Milan
This week sees a whole heap of top flight games from across the Serie A, as seen below we have some alternative options if you don’t fancy the Milan derby, however after excluding this the first time around it only makes sense for EA to include it this time. Investments here are the same as any other top tier game, gold players, lowest price possible and highest rating you can.

Napoli vs Roma
If you don’t fancy the Milan derby, our first alternative is league leaders Napoli against Roma, in a massive clash towards the top of the table.

Lazio vs Juventus
If neither of those games are quite what your after, we have Juventus, who are desperately trying to catch league leaders Napoli, away to Lazio. The bonus with all three of these investment options is that even if your match isn’t included, there is a chance prices rise if the challenge requires higher rated Serie A players.

Barcelona vs Atletico Madrid
Spain is our next stop where we find the league leaders Barcelona playing hosts to second place Atletico Madrid. Now although we recently saw Madrid appear in a marquee matchup, we have seen EA repeat clubs within the same month before. Even though it has a chance though, perhaps investing elsewhere is a safer option this week.

Lokomotiv Moscow vs Spartak Moscow
Moving across to the Russian League now where first place Lokomotiv Moscow play hosts to third place and local rivals Spartak Moscow. Once again we have the luxury of having plenty of gold cards to choose from and hence buying at discard shouldn’t be an issue here.

Porto vs Sporting
Portugal is our next stop where first place Porto are hosts to third place Sporting. With just two points separating the two sides, the match already carries significant importance, but when we couple this with the fact that these two clubs have history and an underlying rivalry as well then things get a whole lot more intense. Investments once more should be simple, just aim for discard!

Toronto FC vs Columbus Crew
The MLS season starts this weekend and what better reason could there be to include a match from the States! Toronto are hosts to Columbus Crew for their opening fixture in a derby known as the “Trillium Cup”. This is much more of an outside investment opportunity and the kind of game that could turn big profits if we get lucky. Investments are likely to be of silver or bronze rarity, aim for discard and sell into the hype for safety.

Orlando Pirates vs Kaizer Chiefs
South Africa is our next stop where we find the only match that ever features in these predictions, Orlando Pirates vs Kaizer Chiefs. This rivalry goes by the name of the “Soweto Derby” and always carries substantial hype and demand whenever it rolls around. Aim for discard as usual and sell into the hype for safety or hols if you really want to roll those dice!

Guadalajara vs America
Our final pick this week sees us heading across to Mexico where Guadalajara play hosts to America in a derby known worldwide as “El Super Clasico”. This match is widely regarded as the biggest rivalry in Mexican football and hence easily makes our prediction shortlist. Once again, by spending discard prices on these players you remove any risk and provide yourself a risk free investment."
"The Curious Case Of Prime Shevchenko, The 433, And Frostbite",19-Feb-18 13:23,"Hey comrades, welcome to FUT FM Episode 38! From Prime Shevchenko to EA’s Frostbite engine, we’ve got so much to dig into today.
So let’s jump right in!
Note: We talk about real football and Guardiola for the first 5 or 6 minutes in the audio, feel free to fast forward if you only care about FIFA.
 

 
Is Prime Icon Shevchenko The Real Deal?

Early on in FIFA 18, the the entire FUT FM crew had played many times with Shevchenko in draft, and we all loved him.
At the same time though, this was when it was much easier to score goals. And now we have the legend’s Prime Icon card, so how does 91 Shevchenko hold up in today’s metagame?
Although Sheva’s attributes look great on paper, his in game performance leaves a lot to be desired. Upgraded Weekend League teams bully him off the ball easily due to his balance and strength, and his passing is not what you’d ever want from an elite player.
At the same time, Sheva’s speed isn’t anything that you couldn’t get from other cards, so he doesn’t stand out in that regard either.
But what about his shooting?
Prime Sheva has great finesse, free kick, and long shot traits, but he’s a bit of an enigma. For inexplicable reasons, we found him missing inside the box sitters very often compared to other strikers. Is this a case of user error or do his combined attributes make him not so great in the box? It’s hard to say.
As big fans of Shevchenko, we are a bit biased towards wanting him to be good. But even so, his 81 agility is criminal. The dude was a nightmare for defenders in his prime.
We also find it strange that his prime card only has 85 composure, when he needed ice in his veins for the role he played.
Overall, Prime Icon Shevchenko is a vanity player. You can get much better options for his position, but you’ll enjoy playing with him if you were a big fan of his.
What do you think of Shevchenko? Let us know on Twitter!
 
The Lack Of False 9 433 Formations In FIFA 18’s Weekend League?

We’ve noticed that in FIFA 18, the 433 is mostly dead when it comes to Elite 1 and competitive play.
As an Elite 1 player, Valerio decided to try rocking it again in the WL, and he went 10-0 with it.
Sounds good on paper, right?
The thing is, as soon as Valerio started facing strong opposition, the 433 and the False 9 role lost their effectiveness.
It’s very strange that one of the most popular formations in football is so ineffective in FIFA 18, and it’s a bit difficult to pinpoint why. Could it be because the AI doesn’t really know how to move in a 433 to create free flowing link up play? Is it because pace is hugely important and passing is too easy?
Overall, ping ponging the ball is easier and more efficient than trying to run a 433. Despite the promise of width and killer runs, the 433 doesn’t produce the same variety in attack because it’s harder to link up play.
It’ll be very interesting to see how this evolves for FIFA 19.
 
Did The Latest FIFA 18 Patch Actually Change Anything?
 

It’s fair to say that the latest FIFA patch (as of February 15) changed kick off for the better, with your defenders acting more compact and the attackers not behaving super aggressively.
Goalkeepers have stopped their annoying auto clearances.
But apart from that, is there really a new meta? We don’t think so.
There have been a lot of reports from the community saying that they’ve noticed very specific changes. People have been panicking for weeks trying to rebuild their teams, change formations, and generally improve.
However, we’ve been unable to detect any major changes to match flow and the general meta. We think that maybe first touches can be a little worse, but it’s difficult to say with how varied the Weekend League gameplay can be.
As FIFA 18 begins to wind down, we’re not likely to see major gameplay patches. There were a couple of big ones close to release in 2017, but for 2018 it’s hard to see the gameplay changing much as EA works more on FIFA 19.
 
The Curious Case Of The Frostbite Engine

We are not game developers...
We are not game developers…...
Everyone together now: we are not game developers.
But the question must be asked; is the Frostbite Engine too difficult to develop for, unless you’re making a first person shooter?
Frostbite was developed by Dice, the folks who make Battlefield. Since Battlefield moved to Frostbite, we’ve seen massive upgrades to the gameplay thanks to the new tech.
But...
There’s no denying the fact that many Frostbite games in recent years have been received poorly by critics and fans. Whether it’s a driving game like Need for Speed or a third person sci fi epic like Mass Effect Andromeda, something’s just not right here.
Does FIFA need a longer development cycle than what it currently has? Should it follow a 3 team model like Call of Duty? Should EA Sports try to develop their own engine custom built for sports game needs?
We don’t have the answers, but it’s been 2 games now, and FIFA still has a lot of the same animation, collision, and physics bugs. Legs warping through each other have been greatly improved for FIFA 18, but it’s still present along with a plethora of other glitches we’ve all seen before.
Whether it’s the engine, business practices, or team dynamic, it’s important to have these conversations because the alternative is to bury problems under the rug.
What do you think about FIFA on Frostbite? Has it made a positive or negative difference for you? Or have you not noticed anything unusual? Let us know on Twitter.
As always comrades, thanks for checking out FUT FM! We’ll be back next week.

TOTW5 Predictions,16-Oct-17 22:14,"Starting Eleven
Lecomte - Montpellier - GK
Montpellier played host to OGC Nice over the weekend and despite the visitors best efforts Lecomte kept them out of the match. The hosts won 2-0 and with 8 saves and a man of the match performance, surely Lecomte has done enough here.
A.Berezutskiy - CSKA - CB 
CSKA travelled to FC Krasnodar for their weekend match and the entire backline were ready. Controlling the game, keeping a clean sheet and scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win, Berezutskiy put in a fantastic performance and is hopefully rewarded with his spot here.
Vestergaard - B Gladbach - CB 
Werder Bremen were hosts to the travelling Borussia M.Gladbach in this Bundesliga clash. Vestergaard held down his defensive line, keeping a clean sheet and finding a goal along the way in a 2-0 win.
Meunier - PSG - RB 
In form PSG travelled to Dijon for what most expected to be a straight forward victory. The hosts however had other plans. It took a goal in the 93rd minute and Meunier's second to secure the three points and possibly a second inform for himself.
Elustondo - R Sociedad - CB 
This La Liga fixture saw Real Sociedad travel to Alaves. The hosts were completely locked out of the matching, not even managing a shot on target. Elustondo was a key part of this performance, picking up a goal from the back while securing that clean sheet.
Fekir - Lyon - CAM 
Lyon played host to Monaco in this important Ligue 1 fixture. The match was back and forth with neither team being able to hold a lead for long. It took Fekir until the 95th minute to score the winner, picking up his second goal to go alongside his assist, yellow card and perfect match rating.
Thiago - Bayern - CM 
Over to the Bundesliga now and Bayern were hosts to Freiburg. In a dominate 5-0 showing an inform is likely to be given, but picking the recipient is far from simple. Kimmich with a clean sheet/goal and Coman with a goal/assist have a real chance without doubt. The standout player for me however was Thiago who bagged himself a goal and picked up the man of the match award in a dominant performance.
Sterling - Man City - RM 
It seemed like City had no limits when it came to scoring this season and when Stoke arrived, this was proven once again. In a crazy 7-2 win, Manchester City had several incredible performances. With a goal and 2 assists, Sterling was one of them.
Guedes - Valencia - LM 
Real Betis played host to Valencia in this goal packed La Liga derby. Valencia left 6-3 winners, and with a 9 goal thriller usually comes an inform of some sort. Guedes seems to be the key choice here, with a goal, an assist and a man of the match award, hopefully he has done enough.
Jesus - Man City - ST 
Just like Sterling, Jesus was ready to pounce when Stoke arrived. Picking himself up 2 goals in the 7-2 thrashing, he surely has a chance of making this week's team.
Icardi - Inter - ST 
One of the biggest derbies in Italian football fills the final spot in the starting eleven, Inter Milan vs AC Milan. In a tightly contested performance it took an incredible show from Icardi to finally finish the match 3-2. With 3 goals, including a 90th minute penalty, there is no chance Icardi isn't leading the line this week.
 
 
Substitutes
Immobile - Lazio - ST 
Lazio traveled to Juventus in this all important Serie A fixture. Despite Costa giving the hosts an early lead, Immobile fought on to strike twice (once from the spot) in order to secure a 2-1 win and all three points for Lazio.
Ziyech - Ajax - CAM 
Over to Holland now and Ajax were hosts to Sparta Rotterdam. While Ziyech failed to actually score in this 4-0 win, he did provide two important assists alongside a near perfect man of the match performance.
Abraham - Swansea - ST 
Swansea went into their game against Huddersfield desperately needing the points. Luckily their young striker Abraham had the same mindset and provided both goals in their 2-0 win.
Bentley - Brentford - GK 
Over to the Championship now and Brentford were hosts to Millwall. Brentford picked up a 1-0 win, but the hero was their goalkeeper Bentley. With 6 saves, a man of the match award and even a penalty save, he ensured his team took the points and deserves his spot in these predictions.
Basham - Sheffield United - CB 
In a tightly fought fixture between Sheffield United and Ipswich, it took a standout performance from their centre-back to secure the win. Basham secured a clean sheet, goal and the man of the match award, a valiant show!
Belluschi - San Lorenzo - CAM 
San Lorenzo were hosts to Defensa y Justicia in this Primera Division clash. The home team managed to battle through and pick up a 3-1 victory and while Belluschi didn't score any of the goals, he did provide all 3 assists and grab that man of the match award too.
Pereiro - PSV - CM 
VVV-Venlo were hosts to PSV in the Eredivisie this weekend. The travelling team were the 5-3 winners and Pereiro provided the standout performance. With 2 goals and a perfect rating, it becomes hard to overlook him here.
Nikolic - Chicago Fire - ST 
Chicago were hosts to Philadelphia in this MLS clash where the hosts managed to pull off a 3-2 win. Nikolic was the hero for Chicago, scoring all three goals, picking himself up the match ball and surely a spot in the team of the week too.
Ducksch - Holstein Kiel - ST 
In this Bundesliga 2 match, it was the visitors Holstein Kiel who picked up the points over FC Heidenheim. In this 5-3 victory it was their striker, Ducksch who stood out. With 3 goals and an effort scrapping the woodwork, surely he has done enough to force his way into the team.
Berry - Luton - CAM 
In the lower English leagues Luton were hosts to Stevenage in this 8 goal thriller. Sadly for the visitors, only one of these goals went in their favour. From the 7-1 win, it was Berry who managed to grab the hatrick and with it a spot in these predictions.
Michel - Paderborn - LM 
We have another 8 goal thriller here, with Paderborn the 7-1 victors over the travelling Weser Bremen II. While the team played fantastically, it was their left midfielder Paderborn who picked up the match ball after a fantastic hattrick.
Aspas - Celta Vigo - ST 
Celia Vigo travelled to Las Palmas for this 7 goal Monday night fixture. Aspas was the hero of the hour, bagging himself 3 goals and ensuring his team picked up the points despite being reduced to 10 men early into the second half."

First up on our list of predictions (based upon FIFA career mode), we head over to England and the Premier League. While you can find a list of all upgrades and downgrades below, here are a few of the players (who also have special cards) that really stand out. 
 
Hazard +1 Upgrade 
First up we have the Belgium right winger, Eden Hazard. After a sensational couple of seasons in the Premier League, Hazard really appeared to struggle in 15/16, leaving many people doubting whether he could really be included in the category of world class. Since this he has really started to develop once more, helping Chelsea to win the league last year and almost single handedly winning Chelsea matches this year. With 8 goals, 2 assists and only 3 losses this year while selected, Hazard shows just why he deserves a +1 boost. 

De Gea +1 Upgrade
It goes without saying that David De Gea is one of the best goalkeepers in the world, and seeing him finally receive a spot in the community based TOTY this year is the least he deserves. From a total of 24 appearances this year, De Gea has accumulated 14 clean sheets and just 3 losses, despite the at times shaky defensive line that sits just above him. For potentially the best goalkeeper in the world, a +1 upgrade feels completely deserved. 

De Bruyne +2 Upgrade
Next on the list is the Belgium sensation from Manchester City, Kevin De Bruyne. Since his transfer from Wolfsburg, there has been no doubt around his ability and for anything still on the fence, this season has surely convinced them otherwise. With a total 6 goals, 10 assists and an average of 72 passes per match, a +2 upgrade is more than deserved.

David Silva +2 Upgrade
At the ripe old age of 32 and with the lack of people using his card on FUT, it becomes quite easy to forget just how incredible this Spanish CAM actually is. With 5 goals and 8 assists from just 20 games this season, the stats speak for themselves, but when you then consider that Manchester City have won 19/20 games while he was playing and drew the other, you really start to notice just how important he is. A +2 upgrade in this situation would be more than deserved. 

Pogba +1 Upgrade
Off the back of a record transfer last season, this young French superstar is really showing Manchester United how much he has changed. Sadly, due to injuries, Pogba has played just 14 games so far this season, but with 3 goals, 9 assists and 0 loses, he shows just how important he really is to the side. Hopefully he can continue to stay fit and show everybody just why he deserves a +1 boost. 

Kane +2 Upgrade
Tottenham currently sit fifth in the Premier League after a fairly tough season. Certain stars haven't been as prolific as they were last year, but Harry Kane certainly doesn't fall into this category. With a total of 21 goals already this season it quickly becomes very clear just why he received his spot in the TOTY and could be granted a massive +2 ratings boost. 

Salah +2 Upgrade
This 25-year-old Egyptian has an incredible season at Roma last year and with a big money move to Liverpool people were skeptical as to just how well he would adapt upon returning to the Premier League. Well, half way through the season it is safe to say that anybody who held any doubts has been well and truly silenced. With 20 goals and 7 assists in the league already, he has more than shown his worth and a +2 upgrade is more than deserved. 

Sterling +2 Upgrade

After his big money move from Liverpool a few years back, Sterling has never quite been able to live up to the expectations and hype that surrounded him as a youngster. The arrival of a new manager however seems to have completely revitalized the Englishman and from just 22 appearances he has already bagged himself 14 goals and 4 assists this season. Hopefully this form can be maintained going forward, but for now a +2 upgrade is definitely fair.

Serie A:

For the second part of today's predictions, we head over to Italy and the Serie A. Again, you can find a complete list of all our prediction upgrades and downgrades below, but these are the guys that really stand out! 

Dybala +1 Upgrade
First up for the Serie A, we have a young Argentinian superstar who goes by the name of Paulo Dybala. When we look back to his campaign last year, he achieved 11 goals from 31 appearances and the whole world knew just how incredible he was. This year, at the half way point, he already has 14 goals, proving that he is a player that is clearly improving year after year. 

Handanovic +1 Upgrade
The 33-year-old Slovenian goalkeeper proves that age is just a number, improving year after year and showing his worth time after time. Inter Milan have put themselves in a fantastic position to fight for a Champions League spot this year and right at the center of this campaign sits this man. With just 2 losses while playing and 9 clean sheets already this year, Handanovic has saved Inter Milan numerous points, showing just why he deserves this +1 boost. 

Mertens +1 Upgrade
Last year Napoli really struggled with injuries and Mertens was the man selected to take up the central forward role. People knew he was competent, but what he went on to deliver surprised almost everybody. With 28 goals across the campaign, Napoli finished third, just 5 points behind league winners Juventus. Moving into the 17/18 campaign, Mertens goal scoring numbers may not be quite as impressive with just 11 so far, however Napoli currently sit atop the table, and this man has played a huge part in this. 

Insigne +2 Upgrade
We move straight onto another Napoli player now, an Italian by the name of Lorenzo insigne. Like we mentioned above, Napoli are simply going from strength to strength and a player with a toolbox the size of Insigne is the sole reason behind this. Whether assisting, scoring or simply giving the oppositions defense nightmares Insigne more than deserves a +2 upgrade. 

Icardi +2 Upgrade
Mauro Icardi really started to make a name for himself last year. After scoring 24 goals from 34 matches and receiving numerous inform cards on FIFA, people started to remember this young Argentinian strikers name. With 18 goals from just 21 games so far in the 17/18 season, he has not only proved that he is far from a one season wonder, but he has also proved he is one of the most prolific strikers around. A +2 upgrade is more than deserved on this occasion. 

Perisic +2 Upgrade
The 28-year-old Croatian left midfielder has had some fantastic seasons across his footballing career, but it seems that he is still improving year after year. With 7 goals under his belt already this season he has proven that he can not only influence a match through a supporting role, but can also steal the show and find the back of the net when given the opportunity. Another Inter Milan player and another possible +2 rating just feels right here. 

Immobile +3 Upgrade

At the start of the season Lazio were likely considered underdogs when it came to pushing for a Champions League spot, especially when you consider the amount of money spent elsewhere. Immobile however clearly had other plans, and with a total 20 goals already from just 19 games, this Italian is on fire right now.  We have seen plenty of +1 boosts, a good amount of +2, but to achieve a +3 upgrade is truly incredible and something Immobile has clearly earnt. 

Milinkovic-Savic +3 Upgrade
After a massive +3 upgrade on the cards for Immobile, we move onto yet another Lazio player and along with it another potential +3 upgrade as well. Milinkovic-Savic has been an absolute rock so far this season, whether supporting the attack or playing his role in defense, it feels like this man has no limits. With just 4 goals to his name last season, he has almost doubled it at the halfway point this year and to top it off, he shows no signs of slowing down either.

Review - Prime Ronaldo (R9),24-Mar-18 15:33,"Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima, also known as ‘R9’, was a generational talent that gave Pele a run for his money. Known for being an extremely clinical striker Ronaldo never failed to score for every team he played for. This skillful and genetic talent was a joy to watch and somehow seemed to never stop scoring. Translated into FIFA, R9 earned himself a 96 rated card that drops jaws. There’s no doubt he’ll cost you an arm and a leg, so let’s see whether it’s better you keep your limbs or sever them for the greater good. 
This review is based on 10 games using Ronaldo on Basic, and Architect chemistry styles. He was used in the following team:

 
PACE
97 acceleration and 97 sprint speed. Ronaldo is lightning fast and you seem to forget he’s 6 feet tall (183cm), he blasts off from a standstill like a dog after a squirrel. This barreling speed is immediately noticed when he touches the ball because pressing the spring button is like unleashing that dog. There’s really nothing much else to say here aside from that, his pace is outstanding and everything you could ask for, he can beat anyone on the pitch with ease and that’s that. One con though is when he’s sprinting he cannot keep the ball very close, R9 pushes the ball ahead of himself fairly far so you have some issues with losing control if you switch direction too often at his top speed.
RATING: 5/5

SHOOTING
I’ll begin with the stats again, 95 positioning, 98 finishing, 93 shot power, 90 long shots, 96 volleys, and 89 penalties. He does not miss, and that’s it. Every shot that Ronaldo takes is absolutely perfect, it feels like something is wrong…how can a card be that good? It’s really something I haven’t been able to say yet this FIFA but Ronaldo makes scoring easy and you don’t have to worry about missing. Whether he’s 30 yards out or face to face with De Gea, R9 will pick out the back of the net without a second thought. His shots are incredibly powerful, and everything seems to go into the very top corner as if to say ‘f**k you Fahrmann watch me slam this where you’d never touch it’. Every finesse, every low driven, every long shot, if it isn’t in the goal it’s slamming off the crossbar. Clinical is a word I’d like to use to describe him, but he’s so much more than that.
RATING: 5/5

PASSING
For a 96 rated card Ronaldo’s passing is pretty poor. For a striker card in this years FIFA Ronaldo’s passing is pretty good. He has 86 short passing, 81 vision, and 87 curve. He has no problem playing a careful through ball or dinking a pass over to the wing. You can’t ask for a lot from him here but he makes nearly every short pass easily and can send a player through on goal reliably. He’s not a playmaker but if necessary he’ll step up to the plate, oops wrong sport. 
RATING: 3.5/5

DRIBBLING
I’ll highlight the first couple stats to begin with, 91 agility and 85 balance. On a 6 foot tall player, having that sort of agility and balance adds a whole other ‘wow’ factor to this card. He’s able to turn on a dime and make it feel fluid and pretty, but also knows how to stay on his feet so well! Next comes his 96 ball control, 97 dribbling, and 89 composure. His first touch is absolutely perfect and his precision dribbling is just as good as Messi. It seriously feels like I’m dribbling with Messi but in fact it’s a taller, faster, and stronger player. Like I had mentioned earlier though, once Ronaldo reaches his top speed he’s shoving the ball fairly far in front of himself, meaning he loses some control to gain speed. That can become sort of a problem when you’re trying to fly down the pitch and change direction too quickly/soon. Do I think he’s the best dribbler in the game? No, I’d say TOTY Messi or Neymar beat him, but he’s not too different to them.
RATING: 4.9/5

PHYSICAL
A surprisingly good category for R9 is his physical stats. He boasts 82 jumping, 81 stamina, and 85 strength. Now 81 stamina isn’t that great but for a striker that’s really all you need to go the full 90 minutes plus maybe a tad bit more, and that rings true in game. He never really feels tired or clunky, but I can’t speak for 120 minutes in as I haven’t used him past 90. But then we move down to that 85 strength, which to be quite honest didn’t feel that high. Ronaldo felt kind of weak to me, like he would get pushed off the ball easily even though he’s kind of tall and has that 85 strength. Don’t get me wrong he’s able to push back and give up a fight but most of the time I find him losing that battle and possession along with it. If I had to guess what his strength was without having seen it, just used him, I’d guess ~75 strength.
RATING: 4/5
 
MENTALITY
Ronaldo is the Swiss army knife of FIFA cards, five star skill moves and five star weak foot along with just about every trait and specialty in the game give you a world class card that has little to no weaknesses. Good height, both feet can shoot, every skill in the game, you can’t ask for much more. But you can ask for better work rates though. Medium/Medium isn’t optimal as you’d prefer him to be farther up in the attack, but I guess that’s probably asking for too much to have everything perfect. Don’t fear though as you won’t notice that and he’s always in the attack and where he needs to be. Ronaldo is essentially the perfect FIFA meta player.
RATING: 5/5

CONSENSUS
I’ll reiterate, Ronaldo is the perfect FIFA meta player:
 
· 6 feet tall (183cm) and 85 strength
· 5 star skill moves and weak foot
· Incredibly clinical (98 finishing)
· 97 pace
· Incredible dribbling and agility.
 
R9 ticks off all the necessary boxes and out comes the perfect striker to put all the others to shame. Of course he’ll cost you a fortune but I think he’s worth more than that. If I wanted to win every game I would trade in my entire club for this card, soon enough I’d have a full Icon team after Ronaldo leads me to weekend league rewards galore. This is a card that will tear up your opponent no matter who else is in your starting XI, he’s a one man army if he needs to be. I cannot rate this card any higher he’s simply astonishing and puts all other striker cards to shame end of story. If you can afford him I can’t recommend him any more, it’s activating a cheat code every game you get into. Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima is a perfect card and will take you to the next level. 
RATING: 5/5

As for what chemistry style to use on him, I decided to work on his weaker areas and used ‘Architect’ which boosts his passing and physical. Ronaldo now has 99 strength and an overall 92 passing. This made him all the more broken and you could feel the improvement. There’s no need to upgrade pace as it’s already 97, shooting is incredible to begin with and doesn’t need an upgrade, dribbling like I had mentioned is great but could be upgraded still. That leaves passing and physical which is why I think ‘Architect’ will give you the best of R9.
 

Game Highlights:"
TOTW23 Predictions,19-Feb-18 15:36,"Starting Eleven
Burki 
Borussia Dortmund were away to Gladbach for their Bundesliga fixture and although they pulled off a 1-0 win, it was anything but convincing. Gladbach has a total of 28 shots, 11 of which were on target and if it wasn't for Burki pulling off some incredible saves, the match could have ended very differently. This one is surely nailed on and a solid way to start these predictions off!
Glik 
Over to France now where Monaco played hosts to Dijon in their Ligue 1 match. In a comfortable 4-0 victory for the hosts there were several fantastic performances, however our selection goes with Glik. A clean sheet and a goal from a CB is often enough to see them make the cut.
Jardel 
Jardel only secured his first inform two weeks ago, which immediately makes this prediction a little riskier, however after a performance like this it becomes very hard to ignore him. Benfica were hosts to Boavista for their Liga Nos fixture on Saturday and during a comfortable 4-0 thrashing, Jardel not only kept a clean sheet but also scored and picked up an assist for himself.
Alba 
Barcelona were on the road to Eibar for their Saturday fixture and with the gap slowly decreasing atop the table, three points was a must have from this game. Luckily, the boys were prepared and in a confident performance they pulled off a 2-0 victory. Alba at the back is the selection here, with a clean sheet and a goal to his name we could be seeing his first inform.
Sandro
Juventus were away to Torino for their Serie A fixture and with Napoli still one point ahead atop the table, only a win was acceptable. Luckily this is exactly what Juventus managed to achieve, although it was far from convincing! Sandro is the man who gets our vote today, with a clean sheet and the only goal to his name, surely, he has done enough to earn his first upgrade of the year.
Coquelin 
The path to glory cards and OTW cards seem to have had the same players being upgraded multiple times throughout the year while the majority of players have failed to even gain a single upgrade. This week however things may be changing on this front and our first nomination goes to the ex-Arsenal player Coquelin. Valencia pulled off a 2-1 victory away to Malaga and Coquelin not only pulled a near perfect match rating, but also scored one of the critical goals to get them back into the game.
Giuliano 
Over to Turkey now where Fenerbahce played hosts to Alanyaspor in the Super Lig. As we mentioned before, there are going to be a few special cards featuring in these predictions and Giuliano is our second. In a comfortable 3-0 victory for the hosts, Giuliano scored twice, picked up the man of the match award and has potentially earnt himself a second upgrade too!
Asensio 
Another prediction and another path to glory player, Asensio makes it three so far! Real Madrid were away to Real Betis for their La Liga fixture and in a game of 8 goals, it was the travelers who stole the points. The match ended 5-3 with Asensio scoring twice to wrap up both the match and the points.
Bailey 
Leverkusen were away to Hamburg for this Bundesliga fixture on the weekend where in an extremely tight game, they just managed to edge the win in a 2-1 victory. Bailey was the player who really stood out this time, achieving the man of the match award and the first goal, should give him a solid chance of a third inform, especially with the lack of games and top performances elsewhere.
Traore
Lyon were away to Lille for their Ligue 1 clash this weekend and with the visitors 2-0 up at half time, the game looked all but wrapped up. Traore was the man who scored both of these goals, putting himself in a fantastic position to achieve yet another upgrade. The only concern is the end result, with the match finishing 2-2, will his 2 goals be enough to secure him another upgrade on his OTW card? We think so.
Cavani 
PSG were once again on fire as they destroyed Strasbourg 5-2 during their Saturday fixture. There were some incredible performances across the board, especially Neymar who not only bagged a goal and an assist but received a near perfect match rating once again. Our nomination however goes to Cavani, 2 goals and a solid performance should be enough for a second inform this week.
 
Substitutes
Perin
Genoa were hosts to Inter Milan for this Serie A fixture and despite the visitors being strong favorites, Genoa came together as a whole to pick up a 2-0 victory and all 3 points. Perin in goal was once again as solid as a rock, making some huge saves and ensuring that clean sheet as well.
Vranjes 
Now this is something that we don't see every week and if this guy doesn't get an inform, well, words simply cannot explain what would happen! AEK Athens were hosts to Xanthi for their weekend fixture, and in a dominant display the hosts left as 4-0 winners. Not only did Vranjes secure a clean sheet, but he also bagged himself a hat-trick. Inform is surely confirmed.
Demetriou 
We head over to England now and while the Premier League may have been out of action, there were some fantastic performances in the lower divisions that deserve our attention. Southend played hosts to Portsmouth in their League 1 fixture and while Demetriou may not have kept a clean sheet, 2 goals in a 3-1 victory from right back, may just be enough to make the cut.
Morrison 
Remaining in the Championship here where Cardiff played hosts to Bolton on Tuesday. With a picture-perfect performance, Morrison not only ensured a clean sheet was kept at the back but he also scored one of the goals in a 2-0 victory.
Canales 
Real Sociedad were hosts to Levante for their La Liga clash this weekend and even though Canales didn't start, he somehow creeps into our predictions today. He came on only after 13 minutes and with the hosts already 1-0 up, he ensured the win was held from start to finish. Scoring himself and assisting the third, hopefully he has done enough to grab himself an inform too.
Viola 
Heading over to the Serie A again now where a revitalized Benevento played hosts to Crotone towards the bottom of the table. At Christmas the task of staying up was impossible and while things are still far from optimistic, the recent run of form have given Benevento an outside chance at least. During this 5-goal thriller it was the hosts who pulled of a 3-2 victory with Viola at center mid scoring once and assisting another.
Streek 
FC Utrecht were away to Roda for their match this weekend and after leaving as 4-1 victors, it looks like the journey was worth it! Streek from the central midfield role is the man who gets the vote here, with 2 goals and the man of the match award surely, he has done enough to squeeze into the mix.
Quaison 
Mainz travelled to Hertha Berlin for their Bundesliga fixture on Friday and in a game of only two goals, Quaison was the man who provided both. Now on any other week two goals may not quite cut it, but with the lack of options coupled with this solid performance, this guy has a real chance.
Potter 
Dropping down the English divisions here and we find Mansfield playing hosts to Newport in League 2. In a comfortable 5-0 victory for the hosts, Potter is the man who gets this acknowledgement, scoring not once, not twice but three goals on the night.
Maurides 
Belenenses were away to Estoril for their Liga Nos fixture this week and despite a fairly tough grind from start to finish, they managed to walk away with all three points under their belts. Maurides was the man of the hour, scoring both goals in a 2-0 victory, picking up the man of the match award and hopefully giving himself a shot at an inform too.
Soares 
Porto were hosts to Rio Ave for their Liga Nos clash on Sunday where in a near perfect performance, they left as comfortable 5-0 winners. Telles once again had a fantastic performance from LB, assisting twice, however our nomination goes to Soares with 2 goals, an assist and a flawless performance from start to finish.
Windass 
Rangers were away to Hamilton Academical for their Scottish Premiership clash where in a game of 8 goals, they managed to edge out the points as 5-3 victors. Windass was the man of the hour, bagging himself a hat-trick and ensuring his side were the champions on the day."
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,26-Jan-18 13:47,"Liverpool vs Tottenham
First up this week we head over to England and the Premier League where we find fourth place Liverpool play hosts to fifth place Tottenham, in an ongoing battle for Champions League spots. We haven’t seen a top fixture from the PL feature in a few weeks and if this fails to show, I would imagine that Arsenal vs Everton could be the one picked! Investments are nice and easy as usual here, gold players galore! 

AS Monaco vs Lyon
Next up we head over to France where we find ourselves with two possible selections from the Ligue 1. With just two points between the clubs, second place Lyon travel to forth place Monaco in a heated match revolving around Champions League qualification. Investments here are simple, gold and discard, and the great part is they also work for the other Ligue 1 option too, SRFC vs EAG as they can be used for both rating and chemistry!

Bologna vs Fiorentina
Staying in Europe once more we head over to Italy where we find Bologna play hosts to Fiorentina in the “Derby dell’Appennino”. We head back to Wikipedia for some more fun facts with this one! Apparently the derby gets its name from the “Appennino Tosco-Emiliano Mountains” of the Apennine Mountains, which separates the two cities.

San Lorenzo vs Boca Juniors
Over to Argentina now and their Primera Division where second place San Lorenzo play hosts to league leaders Boca Juniors. While this match may not be a derby per say, everything is to play for with the winners taking that all important number 1 spot.

Al Ittihad vs Al Ahli
Next up we head over to Saudi Arabia where we find Al Ittihad facing Al Ahli in Saudi Arabia’s longest running top flight derby. The match goes by the name of the “Derby of Jeddah” and dates back to around 1938. Investments here are most likely going to be silver and bronze players, so aim for discard and sell in the hype for safe profit.

Olympiacos vs AEK FC
Next up we head over to Greece where Olympiacos and AEK FC, two of the biggest clubs in Greek football, go head to head. The derby is intensified due to both clubs originating from Athens metropolitan area and with just three points separating the two sides, first place is potentially up for grabs here! Investments should be simple enough, there is a large enough variety of gold players for both teams available and hence discard prices shouldn’t be an issue.

Rapid Wien vs Austria Wien
For our final pick this week, we head over to Austria where Rapid Wien play hosts to Austria Wien in a match known only as the Wiener derby. This match has featured in predictions before, and although we failed to see it happen, prices still pushed the 1.5-2k mark, showing just what hype can do to these cards! Prices have already started rising, so try to snipe, bid and get these guys for discard or as close to as possible!"
TOTW6 Predictions,23-Oct-17 17:00,"Starting Eleven
Oblak 
Last week's team of the week featured one of the worlds best goalkeepers and it looks like there is a good chance we see another this week! Atletico travelled to Celta Vigo where they could only manage a 1-0 win. Oblak was the man of the hour, making 8 saves, keeping a clean sheet and picking up the man of the match.
Gaspar
Villarreal were hosts to Las Palmas in this La Liga clash where the hosts dominated from the start. From RB Gaya picked up a goal alongside the man of the match on this 4-0 triumph.
Diop 
Toulouse traveled to Angers for their weekend match and only a goal could separate the two teams. Diop was the man for the job, managing to keep a clean sheet while scoring the winning goal in a 1-0 win.
Otamendi 
It seems like we could be seeing a Manchester City inform in every team of the week this year, and nothing changes here! Man City played host to Burnley securing a comfortable 3-0 victory. While Sane scored and assisted, competition for attacking players is high this week, leaving Otamendi with a goal and a clean sheet as our pick here.
Kolarov 
Over to Italy for this choice and Torino were hosts to the travelling Roma. Once again, the game was decided by a single goal and with Kolarov the scorer, man of the match and proud owner of a clean sheet, he seems like a perfect fit.
Tolisso 
We move onto a fairly controversial choice here, with the inclusion of a OTW card. Bayern travelled to Hamburg for their weekend game and once again we saw just the one goal. Tolisso picked up the winner and the man of the match, but after seeing two Bayern informs last week, will this be enough?
Alli 
Tottenham were hosts to Liverpool this weekend, and once again goals were flowing. Picking up a comfortable 4-1 victory, Kane was once again the man of the hour. Having had an inform so recently, alongside a player of the month award, makes including him difficult and it's Alli who takes the spot from his solid performance and one goal game.
Khedira 
These next two picks would be dead certainties in any typical week, however the fact that they have active Scream cards creates all sorts of questions! Juventus were 6-2 winners against Udinese and Khedira was responsible for 3 of these goals. A hatrick from a CM is almost always enough, but if he is excluded due to his Scream card, I would imagine Rugani being included picking up a goal and an assist from CB.
Depay 
Lyon travelled to Troyes for their weekend fixture, and left comfortable 5-0 winners. Just like above, Depay bagged himself a hatrick but if he is left out due to his Scream card, we could Mariano or Traore sneak into the mix.
Sanchez 
Everton were hosts to Arsenal on Sunday, and despite an early 1-0 lead, it was Arsenal who left as 5-2 victors. Both Sanchez and Ozil secured a goal and an assist, but with Ozil already featured elsewhere it's Sanchez who makes the predictions.
Dost 
Sporting were hosts to Chaves in an extremely comfortable 5-1 victory and Dost was the man of the hour. Securing himself a hatrick alongside an assist, this one is a no brainier and he simply has to be included here.
 
Substitutes
Muller 
Hallescher travelled to Rwerfurt for their weekend fixture and it's not often we have an inclusion as impressive as this one. Not only did Muller save a penalty to keep his side in the match, but he also scored the equaliser in the final minutes to secure a point for his team in this 1-1 draw.
Murray 
West Ham were hosts to Brighton in this Premier League fixture, but it was the away side who took all the points. In a comfortable 3-0 win, it was Brighton's striker Murray who picked up two and along with it the man of the match award.
Guedes 
Valencia were hosts to Sevilla, and walked away with all the points in a comfortable 3-0 win. Guedes was overlooked last week despite a fantastic performance, this week he achieved 2 goals, an assist and a man of the match award in an almost perfect performance and surely this time it's enough!
Moscati 
Novara travelled to Palermo for this fixture and it was the visitors who left with the points. Moscati was the player who scored both goals from CM in a 2-0 win, and hopefully he has done enough to make the cut.
Pereira
Porto were hosts to Pacos De Ferreira on the weekend, and sadly the trip wasn't an enjoyable one for the visitors. Porto left 6-1 victors and hence have plenty of options for their slot here. Pereira is the one who gets the nod though, with 1 goal, 2 assists and a man of the match award, all from the RB position.
Batshuayi 
Chelsea were hosts to inform Watford on the weekend, and after going behind it was beginning to look worrying for the hosts. It took a little bit of magic from the super sub to pull Chelsea ahead, and with 2 goals and a 4-2 victory, maybe just maybe, he has done enough.
Mooy 
Picking a standout player from this match was tough, as it was the team effort that secured the win, but with newly promoted Huddersfield being the first to topple United, an inform is surely due. Mooy provided one of the goals during the 2-1 victory from a CAM role, but if it's not him then Depoitre could be chosen.
Neres 
Ajax travelled to Feyenoord for their weekend match, and it was the visitors who left as champions. Although he failed to put his name on the score sheet, he was responsible for 3 assists, securing himself the man of the match award and along with it a real chance at making the team of the week.
Thelin 
Zulte Waregem were hosts to Waasland Beveren and on this occasion it was the visitors who stole the show. In a 5-2 victory it was Thelin who picked up four of these goals and with that he is almost guaranteed a slot in the team of the week.
Juklerod 
Vaalerenga were the 7-1 winners in their away fixture this weekend but it was their RM Juklerod who stole the show. Picking himself up a hatrick, and the man of the match award, should be enough to see him make the team.
Leonardo 
Over to the MLS now and it was Houston who played hosts to the travelling Chicago. In a comfortable 3-0 victory, it was their CB who really stood out. Picking up a goal, an assist and a clean sheet should be enough to also find himself featured on FIFA this week.
Jahanbakhsh 
AZ Alkmaar were hosts to FC Utrecht this week and it was the hosts who picked up a comfortable 3-0 win. Their RM Jahanbakhsh was involved in all 3 goals, with 1 goal and 2 assists to his name. The question is, was this enough?"
Review - Prime Icon Gullit,25-Mar-18 06:53,"They are finally here!  The much anticipated drop of Prime ICONS Gullit, Ronaldo, and Maldini brought three elite tier cards into the FUT mix this past Thursday.  After selling off old furniture and any organs I could spare; I was finally able to afford Prime Gullit, on loan.  It is obvious that a player in the elite tier of FIFA is going to cost significant coins, but the state of the market has made even simple tasks incredibly costly.  I was excited to get this review started as I have never tried a Gullit card in past FIFAs.  In all honesty I wouldn’t have completed the loan version of Gullit if I wasn’t writing this review, nevertheless I am  glad I did.  After completing the SBC I found myself planning out the games I would play with him and I decided on a breakdown of finishing the three games left in my season and completing the rest in Weekend League.  Gullit would be enhancing the following squad:


 
EARLY DAYS
I had just finished a review of FUT Birthday Florenzi on Sunday and the idea of playing Gullit in a similar position was attractive.  Side by side gameplay allowed me to simultaneously review Gullit while comparing the notable differences between top tier and elite tier players.  With Gullit playing primarily in the advanced CM role of the 4-3-2-1 formation it made sense to apply the Hunter chemistry style.  After applying Hunter the in-game statistics for Gullit’s Pace and Shooting all move to 99 with the exception of 98 Volleys and 97 Sprint Speed.  According to FUTBIN, 67% of FUT Managers using Gullit agree with my choice as it fits this card perfectly.  The Weekend League stage was set, and Gullit was the main attraction.
 

BODY TYPE & PHYSICAL
The man is massive, full stop.  The only player on my squad that even comes close to his size and presence is Virgil Van Dijk, who is an absolute unit himself.  Throughout the weekend Ruud would score goals, the team would flock to him in celebration, and it looked as though Colossus was gathering the X-Men for a group hug after a successful mission. By now I think all FUT Managers know that body type in players seems to effect certain attributes regardless of stats.  Ruud is a man-mountain and played exactly as I expected.  Winning headers, sending players flying in challenges, stretching to make last second interceptions, and creating a dominating presence in my midfield all go hand in hand with a player his size.  However, my one concern with this body type, is pace. 
RATING: 5/5
 

PACE
99 Acceleration and 97 Sprint should speak for themselves, but they don’t.  This brings me back to body type and the idea that Ruud is simply too big to move at these speeds.  Park the bus took on a whole new meaning for me this weekend as I watched Ruud struggle to get going from a stand still.  Once he is in motion he can get from point A to point B no problem and given his other attributes you can excuse a bit of lethargy.  
RATING: 3.5/5
 

SHOOTING, DRIBBLING, DEFENDING & PASSING
“Wow!”  No seriously, I actually said “wow” as Ruud lashed in a 30 yard shot in my first Weekend League match.  It is as if the game is coded so his shots find the postage stamps of the net.  Ruud doesn’t just shoot the ball; he hammers the ball as if it stole from him, sending the perpetrator flying on a one way stop to its pearly white jail.  
You might notice that this section has four titles and that is because Ruud is the Jack of all trades of FUT.  He honestly has every talent that a player can have.  Left foot, right foot, dribbling, skills, heading, tackling, short pass, long pass, and the list goes on; there are no weaknesses.  Ruud was there when I needed him, whenever I needed him.  My only complaint is that after 20 games I feel an emptiness in my team that only a mixture of three or four players can fill.
RATING: 5/5
 

FINAL SCORE
RATING: 4.9/5
It has been well documented by FUT Managers that ICONs seem to have hidden in-game boosts.  Think of it as an attribute card that is always applied.  Gullit was no exception to this theory and despite the fact that all of his stats are boosted already, he still appeared to have abilities beyond those numbers.  Around game 10 I started referring to these abilities as the Ruud Effect. 
 
RUUD EFFECT
noun ro͞od - əˈfekt
1. an increase in the frequency of goals in your FUT team as the opponent experiences  hopelessness and loss. The effect causes sudden match disruption followed by a message checking to determine who won and who lost.

The Webster’s Dictionary approval is still pending but I think it has chances of sticking.  While my stats with Ruud show 20 games, I would suggest that I played around 15 games when counting total minutes.  He can be a demoralizing factor for opponents.  
And with that, my review draws to a close.  I mentioned the comparison to FUT Birthday Florenzi earlier in my notes and here are my findings.  There is a small margin of difference that sets Ruud apart as an elite tier player even though the total goals and assists between the two was almost identical.  However, at this point in FUT there are endless cards that are affordable and can really make a difference for FUT Managers.  This further demonstrates how important these small margins are.  If you can afford Ruud then 100% he has my recommendation.  If you have the coins and want 20 games of improved team play then the loan is also a fine option; I have spent coins on worse things.  Be warned though, partying with the Gullit Gang this weekend has proved an exciting experience for me; now that he is gone, I just hope I can get over the hangover. 
Cheers for reading!

Saint Patrick's Day,08-Mar-18 10:28,"Saint Patrick’s day is fast approaching and if you pay even the slightest bit of attention to the market, you’ll be able to see that prices are already beginning to skyrocket for Irish players. Why is this though? What are people stockpiling these players for? What should we be expecting? What happened last year? 
Well fear not, as all these questions and more will be answered within the following article!

Saint Patrick’s Day

Saint Patrick’s Day is a religious day in Ireland that celebrates the life of Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland. The celebration takes place on the 17th of March, the traditional death date of Saint Patrick. The event is celebrated across both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

What the event consisted of last year

Last year saw the release of select Republic of Ireland players with exactly the same stats on a green card design.

These were available in both packs and via an SBC. Special packs were released within the store throughout the event, to ensure that supply of these players remained consistent.
Alongside the players, EA also provided us with SBC’s that gave players the opportunity to obtain a rather large amount of coins. These were featured around the “luck of the Irish” concept and gave players the chance to win a “pot of gold”. The challenges themselves were available in different tiers, each with slightly higher requirements but with a higher potential prize pot. 
The challenges themselves required Republic of Ireland players and/or one of the special green Irish player cards.

How we can best prepare for the event

So first up let’s take a look at what was relevant last year and the sort of prices we saw them reach:
Green Irish Players: As mentioned before, these were packable and obtainable via an SBC. Obviously we cannot prepare in advance with these, but if we see a change to the SBC structure they may become a viable investment at the time!
Republic of Ireland Players: Anybody who currently monitors the market will be able to see that hype has well and truly set in and that obtaining a gold Republic of Ireland player for under 1,000 coins is near impossible. During hype around the event last year, we saw these players reach highs of 5-6,000 coins, so potential is definitely there. If investing though take the time to mass bid and snipe if you can, anything for around discard is a fantastic choice and selling in hype before the event is also a viable option to reduce risk!
Higher Rated Gold Players: Although these weren’t vital last year, there is no harm in preparing for a change this time around! Just like any other SBC picking up the few players required is just the start, you also need the surrounding players in order to match rating and rarity requirements. If we are investing in 82 rated players for discard, 83 rated players for around 1,000 and 84 rated players at about 2,000 then we leave ourselves with a secure and safe investment. Even if we don’t need these cards for this event, FUT birthday is just around the corner and we will be prepared a long time in advance!
Now, let’s take a look at what possible investments we could be making that are slightly outside the box. If we are going down this route we need to remember that this is a riskier choice and that nothing is guaranteed!
Northern Ireland Players: Although last year only required Republic of Ireland players, Northern Ireland also celebrates and recognises this event. These cards have hardly moved in price and hence we are provided with a slightly different investment opportunity. If this comes up as a requirement we are flying, the lack of hype means that people won’t be stock piling these cards and if they aren’t needed, we bought for discard so no harm is done!
Gold Players to Link With Irish Players: Chemistry is always important when completing an SBC. Take a look at which league the majority of these players are in and invest in gold cards that build around them. Premier League would be a fantastic starting point here and this ties in with the above gold card investments perfectly.
Special Cards: A bit of a long shot here, but it provides a double investment as FUT birthday approaches. Think about which type of special card is most likely and also take into account the league, nationality and rating too.

Did the players or challenges provide value for money?

The special Irish players that got released were fairly low rated for this point in the FIFA cycle and added no stat boosts either. Now when we couple this with the fact that demand for these players is usually fairly low, we suddenly find an abundance of these cards available on the market. The fact that these players were also obtainable via an SBC ensured prices remained grounded and were at or very close to discard. Of course, this year things may change, but last year these cards weren’t really viable as an investment.
The actual SBC’s were a little strange, it was something that we had never seen before on FUT and hence initial hype and excitement was in full flow. People very quickly started to realise that they were simply losing coins, they were literally gambling X coins in an attempt to gain more. As you can imagine, demand quickly started to dry up and prices soon followed with the decline.
The chances of you actually making a profit from the SBC’s were slim, yes some people hit the jackpot and managed to turn a great profit, however they were few and far between. If history repeats itself and we see the same challenges, unless you are feeling super lucky, I would advise staying clear."
REVIEW - IF 85 Sergej Milinkovic-Savic,26-Jan-18 08:28,"After 19 weeks of FIFA 18 we welcome the newest version of Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, an aggressive and high reaching Serbian who’s card seems to rival the best. The 6’3” Slav earned his second spot into the TOTW after netting two goals against Chievo in Italy’s top division, giving us a mean looking card that gives Nainggolan a run for his money. I pitted him against some of the best in the Daily Knockout Tournament for ten consecutive games with a modest but effective team built around him. After some quality FIFA and a lot of armpit sweat I’m here to report on whether Sergej is worth his price of over 100,000 coins. (Stick around to the end for a couple bonus reviews of two other overlooked players in this weeks TOTW).
This review is based off of 9/10 games using the “Basic” chemistry style, and he was supported by the following team: 

 
PACE
Our 85 rated Nainggolan look-alike steps up to the plate with 76 pace. If I was you I’d read that number and shrug, it’s really nothing special. But he towers over most players by standing very tall at 6’3” (191cm). With that type of height you’d expect <70 pace. For comparison 5’9” (176cm) Nainggolan has 78 pace, and Paul Pogba, who’s the same height as Sergej, has 74 pace. So he’s nearly as quick as Nainggolan and faster than Paul Pogba right off the bat. In game he accelerates slowly, but once he’s taken two strides with the ball he’s able to outpace defenders fairly often. All in all he has decent pace and it’s nothing special, but paired with his height he’s storming his way through the midfield much like Moses parting the Red Sea. 
Rating; 3.5/5

SHOOTING
Sergej Milinkovic-Savic is a gift that keeps on giving. Of all the stats on his card his shooting is the one that is the most misleading. After only 10 games he managed to score 15 goals for me from the CM position in a 4-1-2-1-2 (2), no instructions or chemistry style given. His 80 finishing felt more like 85, which is paired with a scary 97 shot power. But what stood out the most was his 92 positioning. Sergej has High/Medium work rates meaning he’s pushing up to a CAM position from CM. He seemed to join every attack I was making and so often he would be in the perfect position to tap it in with ease. It honest to god stunned me that without forcing the ball to him at all, he was just there to score like it was nothing. Game after game he was outscoring my forwards and making them look like buffoons. Whether it was a powerful shot across the keeper, a low driven into the bottom corner, a tap in with no keeper in sight, Sergej knew how to score very impressively for a defensive-minded midfielder. His shooting had me reminiscent of prime Patrick Vieira or Icon Matthaus. What I’m trying to say is I trust him in front of goal as much as I’d trust my striker, which sounds odd in retrospect but it’s the truth.
Rating; 4/5

PASSING
The Serbian superstar has some pretty bang average passing on his card, let’s not sugar coat it. 81 passing isn’t the most impressive, but in truth the stats are concentrated. His 44 penalties drag down the average. He actually has 87 short passing, 85 long passing, and 85 vision. 95% of his passes every game are spot on with no problem. He makes the passes he needs to make and has no problem sending a crucial through ball to give you the lead in a close game as well. Savic does not disappoint, but it also isn’t his stand out stat. 
Rating; 3.5/5

DRIBBLING
Dribbling isn’t exactly what you expect from a tall and mostly defensive midfielder. You’d expect him to put in momentum swinging tackles and break a couple noses, right? Not quite, Sergej manages to do it all. 85 dribbling on his card is impressive, and even more so when you look closer. 90 ball control, 87 dribbling, and 81 composure show that he has no problem moving his way up the pitch. If we take a look at Bakayoko for example he really has one or two key features, defending and physical. Once Bakayoko wins the ball back he’s sending it to essentially anyone else who doesn’t have a brick in their shoe to move it up the pitch. Yet when Savic wins the ball back, you no longer have to get rid of it as quickly as possible because he can actually maneuver his way through your opponent. Now he’s no Nainggolan as he lacks the agility considering his height, and neither is he Paul “It’s only okay to dab with me” Pogba, but he’s still usable on the ball and that’s not something you can say about many players similar to him such as Matic, Busquets, Khedira, etc. He has a very close control when he’s moving slowly (especially when using LT/L2) and that allows him to be an attacking threat as well as a defensive one. In all honesty he surprised me considering how I came into this assuming he’d feel odd and displaced dribbling. He does lack agility considering it’s only 71 rated, which to be fair isn’t terrible. But 63 balance isn’t too helpful and should scare you away from being too adventurous with him. 
Rating; 3.5/5

DEFENDING
Having that 81 defending is what makes Sergej’s card appealing, it shows that he can do it all! But I’d like to shed some light on that. First of all, he has High/Medium work rates. What this means is that Sergej is essentially playing the role of your CAM (unless you stick him at CDM and to “Stay Back While Attacking” which I do not recommend). He loves to push up with the play and get involved instead of playing a deep playmaker role sitting further back. With that clarified, his defending isn’t noticed for that reason. Yes he will intercept the ball for you a couple times and make a few tackles, but the way he’s designed is not to sit back and fulfill only that role. You’ll notice him trying to start an attack more often that he is trying to dismantle your opponents. When he is in that position to defend though he does a good job. His 81 standing tackle shows he’s no stranger to stepping on an ankle or cutting off a play. That paired with 86 interceptions helps Sergej to turn your opponents attack into your counter, not only that but he can scoop up a loose ball and work it up the pitch himself much like a one man army. When compared to the likes of Nainggolan who is most likely your other option at the moment, Nainggolan is the better of the two at defending hands down. But Sergej is less of a pest in the midfield like a Kante or Nainggolan and instead a Pogba/Alli/Hamsik/Vieira who aims to play nearly every role in the midfield defensive or not. For that reason I do not recommend using him as a CDM, but as a CM because he’s a card that is always itching to move alongside Mertens and Dybala instead of Koulibaly and Chiellini.
Rating; 3/5

PHYSICAL
If I was asked to point out what area makes Sergej the Serbian tank, I think you’d point to physical before I did considering I called him a tank, which is pretty self-explanatory…
His obscene 89 strength means he does not bow down to anyone (except Bailly and Ibrahimovic of course). His tank tread-like legs plow him through anyone brave enough to challenge the Serb. You can find Sergej by following the trail of injured midfielders and he’ll surely be waiting at the end without a scratch on him. Not only that, but he’ll be able to do it for all 90 minutes considering he has 88 stamina, I did find him to have trouble in extra-time though so be wary because he begins to run out of petrol. One good thing I noticed with Sergej is he’s often at the front post during corners, both on the attack and defense. Since he’s 6’3” and has 88 jumping and 95 heading accuracy he will have no trouble redirecting a corner into the back of the net. Of my 15 goals with him I believe 2 were from set pieces like those. You’d think physically Nainggolan has no chance to stand toe to toe with Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, but he does due to one stat. Sergej’s 75 aggression leaves something to be desired, meaning he doesn’t lunge into tackles giving 100% like Nainggolan will. You’ll notice his strength not necessarily when he’s fighting to get the ball, but rather to keep possession of it. 
Rating; 4.5/5

MENTALITY
With all of the 6 major sections discussed, there’s still one more, Sergej’s mentality. Is that the right word for this? No probably not, but my thesaurus let me down. Anyone with 3 star skill moves is generally at a disadvantage this year, but some players simply don’t need it. Sergej is a pretty cut and dry player. He is able to do just about everything needed from him and well, in the end you don’t really realize that he has 3 star skill moves. He’s a player who doesn’t really need it because it doesn’t fit his play style. If he had 4 star skill moves I’d be even more impressed but honestly he’s not breaking down the wing, and he’s not trying to dribble one-on-one with the opposing defenders most of the time. In all honesty it doesn’t set him back and I don’t find it as a con for his card. His 4 star weak foot is a big bonus though. One of the reasons he’s such a well-rounded player continues to the fact that he can nearly use both feet equally as well. In front of the net he has no issue on his left and the same goes for passing. Is it just as good as his right foot? No, and you might notice it at times but only if he’s taking a long shot from outside the box where power and precision are an absolute must. Sergej even boasts the “Power header” trait alongside the “Flair” trait. He really has no problem taking the role of everything from a defensive midfielder to a striker when he’s called upon. 
Rating; 3.5/5

CONSENSUS
Average Rating; 3.64/5
Sergej Milinkovic-Savic is in my opinion a must-have in any Italian league side, or any modest Weekend League side. I’m not simply saying that, in my eyes he is the cheap man’s Vieira and Pogba hybrid. But you have to play him to his strengths. He is not a CDM, his work rates simply do not support a defensive style because he’d always be out of position. And to be quite honest neither is he a box-to-box midfielder who will push back and bomb forwards. If you’re planning on buying his card, expect 25% defending, 25% dictating the midfield, and 50% attacking. You have to let him play the ball, win the ball, and get in the right position to finish the ball. He will silently appear and score, aggressively pound his way through the middle of the pitch, and efficiently stop an attack all within 5 minutes. 
I found him to work best as a central midfielder with no instructions. I once heard some wise words somewhere that said “he protec, but he also attac”. Truer words have been never spoken, do not confine him to a role or a position but rather let him do what he does and in the end you’ll be happy. And if you were entertaining the idea of a chemistry style to best boost this robust and strapping Serbian I would recommend using Engine to better his dribbling, pace, and passing. But in the end I wish you not good luck, but rather your opponent, because I don’t believe that anyone is ready to come up against Sergej “The Unicycle Bear” Milinkovic-Savic.

Bonus Review! 
Alongside the main Serbian player I had the new inform Kessie and Monreal as they had caught my eye. Both of them are nearly discard prices around 15,000 coins but I had figured they were worth a try in the team so I fit them in. 

Kessie surprised me the most, he’s incredibly quick and dives into his tackles aggressively. He just has the drive to win the ball back. But he’s definitely more defensive minded in comparison to Sergej. His High/High work rates mean he’s up and down the pitch defending and aiding the attack. His passing is consistent and deliberate and dribbling is up to par with top defensive midfielders. What shines the most though is his physical, Kessie has 86 strength and even 89 stamina meaning he’s able to bully people off the ball all 90 minutes. He’s like a FIFA 17 Renato Sanches. 
Monreal is really nothing special I’m sorry to say, especially coming from an Arsenal fan. He had his moments but in general he’s average and you’re much better off with any other fullback who has over 83 pace. If you did decide to use him I highly recommend boosting his pace fully with a shadow. His best area is his defending. He does have impressive dribbling for a fullback which is very nice to have, along with good passing too. But to be quite honest those are not the important stats needed for a fullback."
FUT FM Episode 49,04-May-18 05:13,"Hey comrades, this week we have one of the best players in the world joining us. That’s right, YimmieHD is here, so let’s jump right in.
 

 
Adaptability Is Crucial To Being A Good Player

YimmieHD credits adaptability as the most important trait for being successful in FIFA 18. It’s almost an abstract concept, so let’s break it down into some specific examples.
In FIFA 17, L2R2 dribbling ruled the high level meta game. The way you moved with L2R2 resulted in specific types of plays being more effective than others. But in FIFA 18, L2R2 behaves very differently, meaning that all of those plays are no longer as good as they were.
As a result, the movements you make in FIFA 18 need to be different than the movements you might have made thousands of times in the past game.
Similarly, good spots to shoot from have changed in FIFA 18. The best way to pick up on these nuances (apart from playing a lot!) is to watch pro gameplay closely.
You have to embrace change in FIFA. We’ve even seen 18 vary wildly through many patches since launch. If a specific technique stops working, stop trying to make it work after a while. If you notice something working really well though, double down on it.
Adaptability separates the best from the rest.
 
Defending And Team Building
 


As YimmieHD points out, it’s harder to apply pressure to attackers in FIFA 18.
As a result, defending has become a lot tougher for high level players. In his case, he always builds his teams from the back, in order to cover up for his self-described main weakness.
If you’re finding that you’re conceding a lot of goals, don’t be scared of investing in quality defenders. The difference between a CB who can turn and one who gets stuck in mud is crucial, especially when you go up against killer weekend league teams featuring many Prime Icons and other special cards.
A quality CDM or at least a CM who stays back completely changes the composition of a match. Since most FIFA players try to bulldoze their way through the center of the pitch, a good defensive card or 2 will act as great counters.
Adaptability and making sure your defense is fleshed out are YimmieHD’s 2 main tips for getting better at FIFA. If you want to learn more and hear about his pro journey, be sure to listen to the full interview at the top.

TOTW 35 Predictions,14-May-18 17:48,"Starting Eleven
Shunin 
First up this week is a big Russian derby, featuring two sides from Moscow. Spartak and Dinamo went head to head and in a game that provided only a single goal, it was the visitors, Dinamo, who took the points. Shunin was absolutely breathtaking between the sticks, commanding his defence and pulling off 9 fantastic saves to secure the clean sheet.
Marcano 
Porto were away to Vitoria De Guimaraes for their weekend fixture, and in a game that provided just a single goal, it was the visitors who took all the points. Marcano was fantastic at the back, defensively solid and in control throughout, while he showed his ability going forward as well, scoring the games only goal.
Albiol 
Napoli may have recently blown their chances of taking the Italian crown from Juventus, however this doesn’t stop them finishing the season in style. Napoli were on the road to Sampdoria this week, and after a comfortable 90 minutes, they left as 2-0 winners. Albiol was the man of the match, solid at the back, while also scoring one of the goals.
Sigurdsson 
Over to Russia again now, where F.C. Rostov played host to Ural for their league fixture. Once again, it was a game with only a single goal, and this time it went in favour of the hosts. Now while Sigurdsson may not have scored, he was absolutely brilliant throughout, the core of the team, and this nomination is thoroughly deserved.
Guilavogui 
Over the Germany now, where Wolfsburg played hosts to F.C. Cologne, in a game that provided 5 goals. Sadly for the already relegated Cologne, 4 of these went against them, with the match ending 4-1. Guilavogui was sensational in the midfield, running rampant around the opposition, while also providing a goal and an assist too.
Lanzini 
Next up we head over to England, where the final games of the season took place. West Ham ensured they ended the season on a high, with a 3-1 win over Everton and while there were plenty of standout performances, we believe it’s Lanzini who deserves the nomination here. With two goals to his name, could a second Inform be on the cards?
Sane 
Manchester City have already been crowned champions of England, but coming into their final two games, it was all about just how many records they could set. Mid-week they had Brighton, and in a 3-1 victory Sane really stood out with 3 assists. The only other option I can see, is Jesus, for scoring that final goal on the weekend to take City to 100 points.
Thauvin 
After missing out on the player of the year award on the weekend, Thauvin may be feeling a little disheartened. Did he deserve it? Possibly, however anybody toppling Neymar was always going to be a difficult challenge. His chance of an Inform however is present, as although Marseille drew 3-3 on the weekend, it was 2 goals and an assist from Thauvin that got them the point
Dembele
Just in case you thought our last decision was a little risky, we move onto a second Barcelona player, destroying all rules and beliefs you may have once held! We move onto their midweek game now, where they were comfortable 5-1 winners over Villarreal. Dembele was a huge part of this, with 2 goals and the man of the match award. It may have taken the whole season, but could we finally be seeing an upgrade this week?
Bale
We find ourselves moving from two Barcelona players, to their bitter rivals, Real Madrid, for our next selection. Now while the La Liga TOTS is in packs, plenty of big names failed to make the cut, however it’s never too late to get their name in lights! Real Madrid picked up a comfortable 6-0 win over Celta Vigo, and with 2 goals, Bale is our nomination here.
Salah 
It’s tough to imagine yet another special card for Salah, yet after he broke the record for most goals scored in a 38 game campaign on the weekend, it’s also tough to imagine him not getting one. With a goal and an assist during Liverpool’s 4-0 win over Brighton, Salah was once again brilliant. However, if he somehow misses out, I fully expect to see Robertson take his spot here.
 
Substitutes
Melia 
Over to America for our first substitute selection, and Kansas were on the road to Atlanta. It was far from smooth sailing for the visitors and even though they picked up a 2-0 win, without Melia in goal, the result could have been very different. With 8 saves, a clean sheet and a fantastic performance throughout, he has secured his space amongst this week’s nominees.
Ellis 
Staying in the MLS here, where Chicago were hosts to Montreal in a game that once again, provided just the single goal. Chicago left the match as 1-0 winners, while Ellis was the hero on the day. Not only did he help secure the clean sheet, but he was also the provider of the match winning goal.
Lima 
Over to France now, where Nantes were on the road to Angers. It looks like the journey paid off this time, as the visitors left with all 3 points during a comfortable 2-0 win. Lima at the back was fantastic throughout, providing a clean sheet, a goal and our nomination for a team of the week spot.
Erokhin 
Over to Russia for this selection, and while Zenit’s 6-0 win over SKA-Khabarovsk was impressive, when we look at one individuals personal stats, things get a lot more exciting. Erokhin, from the midfield, not only provided an assist, but also scored 4 of the 6 goals. If this doesn’t earn him an Inform, well, I’m done trying to predict them!
Lewerenz 
From one man who scored four to another now, as we approach the second German League. Holstein Kiel were 6-2 victors over Eintracht Braunschweig during their fixture, and Lewerenz was the man in form. Scoring 4 goals and dominating the match, surely this man is also a lock this week.
Donis 
From the second German Division to the first now, where we find League Champions Bayern playing host to a travelling Stuttgart. Surprisingly, this game didn’t go as most predicted, with Stuttgart leaving as 4-1 victors. There were several fantastic performances, however our nomination goes with the man of the match, Donis. With 1 goal, 1 assist and a dominating showing from start to finish, hopefully he has done enough here.
Mount 
Vitesse were on the road this week, as they travelled to ADO Den Haag, for a 7 goal thriller. It looks like he journey was worthwhile here, as the visitors emerged as 5-2 winners, talking all the points back home with them. Mount was absolutely unstoppable, playing a part in four of the five goals scored. With 1 assist and 3 goals, hopefully his hard work will receive the recognition it deserves.
Perez 
Back across to the Premier League now, and despite an incredibly bumpy start to the season, Newcastle ended on quite the high. With performances improving throughout the year, Newcastle finished off their return with a 3-0 win over Chelsea, ending any Champions League dreams they may have had. Perez was in absolutely incredible form, scoring twice and running rampant amongst a lacking Chelsea defence.
Boateng 
Onto the strikers now, and we have already see a player from this match feature within our predictions. Now while Coutinho made the cut with a hat-trick, we have to remember that Barcelona actually lost, so a hat-trick for someone on the winning side, is almost certainly guaranteed an Inform, especially when it ruins an unbeaten season for league winners Barcelona. Boateng was brilliant, causing all kinds of trouble and surely cementing his name amongst this week’s line-up.
Braithwaite
Back across to France now, where Bordeaux played host to Toulouse in a 6 goal thriller. It was the hosts to managed to edge out the opposition this time, leaving with all the points in a 4-2 victory. Braithwaite was incredible, playing a part in 3 of the goals, with one assist and two scored himself.
Harbaoui 
Next up we have a match that provided nothing short of pure domination from start to finish. Zulte Waregem were 8-0 winners over Waasland Beveren, and with such a large scoreline, an Inform just has to follow. Harbaoui was in fine form, scoring not once, not twice, but three times, to help secure the win and of course, his hat-trick.
Augustin 
For our final selection this week we head back across to Germany, where we find Leipzig securing European football next year with a 6-2 win over Hertha Berlin. Augustin was a man on a mission, scoring twice and assisting a third to ensure they got the job done.

TOTW 34 Predictions,07-May-18 16:19,"Starting Eleven
Before we jump into things this week, it is important to note that EA may choose to exclude future TOTS players from their final line-up. Now this isn't confirmed, and is purely speculation, but before you get your hopes up, or even possibly invest in PTG/OTW cards, keep this factor in mind.
Also, keep in mind that competition this week was extremely tough, and while we have a 23 man squad, there are plenty of mentions below this that also have a fantastic chance of making the cut!
Courtois
Courtois has only recently received a TOTS during the community vote, however after some incredible saves against Liverpool on the weekend, he could be on his way towards his first inform of the campaign. With 5 huge saves, and dominance of his back-line, he ensured Liverpool failed to score, allowing Chelsea to pick up a 1-0 win and ultimately climb closer towards those all-important Champions League spots.
Van Aanholt
With just a couple of matches remaining in the Premier League, matches between sides fighting relegation have never been so important. Palace were away to Stoke for their fixture this week, and a loss for Stoke would see them relegated. Stoke took a first half lead, but once again failed to see the game out as Palace emerged as 2-1 winners. Van Aanholt was the man behind the second goal, and with so many candidates facing possible TOTS cards, this could very well be enough.
Dawson 
West Brom have been bottom of the table forever, and with an impossible run of games to end the season, people simply assumed they were already relegated. Somehow, they pulled off a win against Arsenal, a draw to Liverpool and this weekend, they managed a win against Tottenham as well. While Livermore was the man who scored the goal, Dawson at the back was incredible. Regardless of who does or doesn't make the cut though, this could be one of the greatest escapes of all time.
Ranocchia 
Inter Milan were away to Udinese for their Serie A fixture this week, and in a fantastic display of form, they left as 4-0 winners. With goals split evenly across four players, picking a nomination is more difficult than normal, however with a clean sheet and a goal to his name, Ranocchia is the man who gets our vote here.
Gaspar 
Villarreal were hosts to Valencia this week, and in a game that provided just a single goal, one man really stood out. Gaspar was incredible at the back, while showed his ability going forward as well, and with Villarreal picking up a 1-0 victory, a clean sheet and a goal to his name, should be enough to see him make the final cut.
Payet 
After Payet was recently overlooked for a man of the match card, during Marseille's victory in the Europa league, the only reason I could imagine he misses out again, is due to an imminent team of the season card. Marseille picked up a 2-1 win over Nice on Sunday, and Payet was absolutely breathtaking. Scoring once and assisting the second, surely, we could see his path to glory card receiving a boost here?
Rodriguez
Bayern were away to FC Cologne for their Bundesliga fixture on the weekend, and while many of us expect James to pick up a TOTS card very shortly, that should mean we exclude him from these predictions. In a 3-1 win for Bayern, James dominated the midfield, scoring once and picking up an assist as well, could possibly see his OTW card taking another boost. The only concern would be EA's unwillingness to include future TOTS players in the line-up.
Suso 
AC Milan have had a rollercoaster of results this year, which should probably have been expected, seeing as they are going through a rebuilding phase. This week however, they picked up a very comfortable 4-1 win over Verona in the league and once again show signs of a brighter future. While Abate picked up a goal and Bonaventura took two assists, our nomination goes with their right winger, Suso. Two assists and a standout performance, could be enough to see him grab his first inform of the year.
Aubameyang 
With Wenger's time at Arsenal coming to a close, and his final home match this weekend, both players and fans were hoping for a massive send-off. This time the players delivered, destroying Burnley 5-0, and giving Wenger a game to remember. Now there are plenty of possible TOTW candidates here, Bellerin with 2 assists, Kolasniac with a goal, Lacazette with a goal and an assist, however we have chosen Aubameyang, who provided 2 goals and an assist.
Gomez
Stuttgart played hosts to Hoffenheim for their Saturday clash, and from kick-off to close, it was all one-way traffic. Stuttgart picked up a comfortable 2-0 win, and Gomez was the hero on the day. With two goals to his name, we could see this path to glory card receiving a second upgrade, just before the season comes to a close.
Traore 
Lyon faced Troyes for their weekend fixture, and in a match of pure dominance, they left with all the points. The game ended 3-0, and while Mendy picked up a couple of assists and a clean sheet, our nomination goes with Traore. Scoring twice and taking the man of the match award, hopefully this youngster has done enough for yet another inform here.
 
Substitutes
Kritsyuk 
Over to Russia for our first Substitute this week, where we find Krasnodar emerging as 1-0 winners over SKA-Khabarovsk. Now while they may have picked up the points, one man was an absolute hero on the day, and that man was Kritsyuk, their goalkeeper. Providing 7 fantastic saves, including one from the spot, he sails into our predictions and could receive his first inform of the campaign.
Kehrer 
Over to Germany next, where Schalke were on the road to Augsburg for their Bundesliga fixture. The match itself was incredible tight, and although three goals were scored, every single one of them, came not from the attack, but from the defense. Schalke edged out a 2-1 victory in the end, with both goals coming from their center-back, Kehrer. If this isn't enough for an inform, well I don’t know what is!
Piatti 
Over to America now, where Montreal played hosts to New England for their MLS fixture this weekend. The game provided 6 goals, and while it was a fairly tight match, it was the hosts who left as 4-2 winners. Piatti was simply sensational, playing a part in all four goals, with 1 goal and 3 assists. This should be the week we see him receive his first upgrade of the season.
Lookman
Leipzig were hosts to Wolfsburg for their Bundesliga clash, and in a dominating 4-1 victory, we have plenty of possible team of the week candidates. Werner picked himself up a goal and an assist, Augustin managed a goal with 2 assists, but our nomination goes with their left midfielder, Lookman. With two goals scored, and a mesmerizing performance from start to finish, hopefully we see this 64-rated bronze card receiving a hefty upgrade.
Trezeguet 
I remember recently including this man in my predictions, and while he was overlooked then, this time he is nothing short of a lock. Kasimpasa were away to Trabzonspor, and in a game that provided 7 goals, 5 of which went in favor of the visitors. Trezeguet was simply breathtaking throughout, playing a direct part in every goal, and finishing the match with 2 goals and 3 assists to his name.
Petrolina
Aves were away to Moreirense on the weekend, and in a game that saw the visitors win 3-0, Petrolina was a man on a mission. Now not only was he incredible from start to finish, but he was involved in each and every one of the goals. Scoring once and assisting twice, hopefully he has done enough to see his name in lights here.
Chalov 
CSKA Moscow were comfortable 6-0 winners over Arsenal Tula in their Russian League fixture this week, and while there were plenty of standout performances, one man rose above the rest. Chalov not only provided an assist, but also went on to secure his hat-trick, making him a lock for these predictions.
Pepe
Back to another name that recently featured within our predictions, and it's the Lille winger that caused so many of us nightmares while attempting to complete the Ligue 1 SBC. Once again, he has delivered, with another 2 goals to his name, during a 3-2 victory over Toulouse. Surely EA cannot keep overlooking this man, right?
Garcia
Eibar were away to Girona for their La Liga clash on the weekend, and in a game that provided us with 5 goals, it was the travelling side who took all the points. Eibar left as 4-1 winners, and Garcia was the man of the hour. Scoring twice and assisting a third, should see him comfortably sail into this week's team.
Martins 
Over to Portugal now, where Vitoria de Guimaraes were away to Tondela. The match provided us with 5 goals, however things were far from close, as the visitors left with a 4-1 win. Martins up top was simply too much for Tondela's defense, causing them all kinds of problems, as he finished the match with two goals to his name.
Eaves 
Back across to England now, where we find Gillingham picking up the points with a 5-2 win over Plymouth. Eaves was a man on a mission in this game, with everything he touched turning to gold. Not only was he incredible throughout, but he went on to secure himself a hat-trick, alongside the man of the match award.
Maclean
Our final selection sees us heading up to Scotland, where St Johnstone were comfortable 5-1 winners over Motherwell. Maclean was the man of the hour, scoring not once, not twice, but three times, to secure both his hat-trick and the win for St Johnstone.

TOTW24 Predictions,26-Feb-18 15:07,"Starting Eleven
Asenjo 
Villarreal were hosts to Getafe for their weekend fixture and despite taking a lead in just the third minute, the game was set to be anything but smooth sailing. The match finished 1-0 and there is one man to thank for this and one man alone. Asenjo was a rock in goal, controlling his backline, dominating the box and also saving two penalties just to ensure he recieves his upgrade.
Calabria 
AC Milan were on the road this weekend as they travelled to Roma for a fixture towards the top end of the Serie A. It was the visitors who put forward the better performance and deservedly left as 2-0 winners with all three points. Calabria is the man who gets our vote today, a clean sheet and a goal from right back, in a fixture this large, is usually enough to secure an inform.
Skriniar 
Inter Milan were hosts to bottom of the league Benevento on the weekend, and with competition for Champions League spots getting tighter and tighter, anything but a win was unacceptable. Luckily the hosts came prepared and while their attacking players may have not been able to find the back of the net, both of the center backs did! Skriniar just steals this nomination with a slightly better overall rating than Ranocchia and after receiving his huge upgrade this week, could he also be receiving his first inform too?
Nuno Henrique
Boavista were hosts to Vitoria de Setubal for their Sunday fixture in the Liga Nos and in an absolute thrashing they emerged as comfortable 4-0 winners. Njie up top scored two of the goals, but our nomination this week goes with their center back, Henrique, who not only dominated the back line and helped in keeping a clean sheet, but also bagged himself a goal as well.
Emre Can 
Liverpool have been unable to stop scoring recently and with things beginning to look solid at the back as well, West Ham were always going to have a tough game away at Anfield. As predictions would have suggested it was Liverpool who emerged as comfortable winners in a 4-1 thrashing, and with a goal and assist to his name, its Emre Can who gets our vote today.
Milinkovic-Savic 
Lazio were away to Sassuolo for their Serie A match on the weekend and it looks like it was worth the trip. During a comfortable 3-0 victory it was once again Savic who stole the show. Scoring twice and dominating the midfield it looks like we could be seeing a third inform in the same week he recieves his winter upgrade, this could be one hell of a card!
Quaresma 
Besikitas were hosts to Fenerbahce for their heated match on Sunday and in a game of four goals, it was the hosts who emerged as 3-1 winners. Quaresma was critical to this success, scoring twice himself and putting in an incredible performance from start to finish, this just has to have secured his second inform of the year.
Jonas 
Benfica were away to Pacos de Ferreora for their Liga Nos match and as most would have expected, it was the visitors who took all three points on the night. In a comfortable 3-1 victory it was Jonas who lead from the front, scoring twice on the night with an almost perfect performance too.
Benzema 
Real Madrid were at home to Alaves in La Liga and with a refreshed Ronaldo having recovered his form, goals were once again flowing. Two goals for Ronaldo just won't be enough for yet another inform, however with a goal from the spot and two assists, Benzema may have just done enough to earn his first.
 
Suarez
Barcelona were at home to Girona for their weekend fixture and once again they were ready to destroy their opponents. In a dominating 6-1 performance; Messi bagged himself 2 goals and an assist, Coutinho managed a goal and an assist, however, the key nomination simply has to go to Suarez who provided us with 2 assists and a hat-trick as well. This just has to be his third inform this week!
Lukaku
At the start of the season most people would have expected Lukaku to have a whole bunch of goals and special cards under his belt by this point, sadly this wasn't to be. Manchester United were hosts to Chelsea for their league match on Sunday where despite initially going one goal behind, they left as 2-1 victors. Lukaku not only scored the first but assisted the second and while normally this may not quite be enough, in such a high-profile fixture I think he may have just secured his second inform of the year.
 
Substitutes
Zwarthoed 
SC Heerenveen were hosts to Excelsior for their fixture on the weekend and although the visitors were the side who stole all 3 points, there is one man in particular who deserves recognition. Zwarthoed ensured that his side were victorious, pulling off some incredible saves and maintaining his clean sheet. With a total of 26 shots against him and 8 on target, this man has truly earnt his inform this week.
Zwinkels 
ADO Den Haag were away to Ajax for their weekend fixture and despite the home sides best efforts, scoring even a single goal just simply wasn’t on the cards. Ajax racked up a total of 32 shots, 11 of which were on target, but thanks to some outstanding saves made by Zwinkels, the game ended 0-0.
Torunarigha 
Hertha Berlin were away to top of the table Bayern Munich for their Bundesliga fixture on the weekend and despite the odds being heavily stacked against them, they held their ground and earnt a 0-0 draw. Now while their keeper had a great game, competition this week is tough and hence it seems unlikely for him to make the cut, Tournarigha however was fantastic at center-back and has rightfully earnt his spot amongst the predictions.
Valoti 
Hellas Verona were hosts to Torino for their weekend match and despite the odds being stacked against them, they emerged as 2-1 victors on the night and took home all 3 points. Valoti from the central midfield role was the hero of the hour, scoring both goals and ensuring his side took all the points.
Mina 
Valencia were at home to Real Sociedad for their fixture against Real Sociedad and despite the visitor's best efforts, it was the hosts who took the points in a 2-1 victory. Mina from the right-wing position was incredible, scoring both the goals and boosting his team to victory.
Idrissi 
AZ Alkmaar were hosts to Sparta Rotterdam for their Eredivisie match on the weekend where in an incredibly tight match, they just managed to edge the win during a 2-1 victory. Idrissi was the hero of the hour, scoring once and assisting the second in a near flawless performance for his side.
Gomis 
Galatasaray were at hosts to Bursapor on Friday and in a game of 5 goals, it was the home side who scored each and every one. Now while there were several solid performances and hence several possible candidates for this TOTW, there is one man who without doubt has managed to secure his spot. With a hat-trick and an assist to his name, Gomis finally secures his first inform of the year.
Murray
Brighton were at home to Swansea and with both sides desperately fighting relegation, all three points were a necessity for each team. In a game of 5 goals it was the hosts, Brighton, who stole the points with a comfortable 4-1 victory. Murray lead from the front, scoring twice and also bagging himself the man of the match award alongside this TOTW nomination.
Ekambi 
Angers were away to Lille for their Saturday match and in a game of 3 goals, it was the travelers who emerged as 2-1 victors on the day. Ekambi was the man of the hour, scoring both goals and securing all three points for his side.
Marega 
Porto were away to Portimonense for their weekend fixture and in a game of 6 goals, it was the visitors who emerged as 5-1 victors. Marega played a part in half of these, scoring twice himself, assisting the third and received a perfect rating from the match. We could be seeing a fair few informs from the Liga Nos this week!
Teodorczyk 
Anderlecht were hosts to Royal Excel Mouscron for their weekend match and in an 8-goal thriller, it was the hosts who managed to edge out a 5-3 victory in the end. A large part of this was thanks to their striker, Teodorczyk, scoring himself 2 from open play and another from the spot to wrap up not only his hat-trick, but hopefully his first inform too.
Dabbur 
Salzburg were away to Sturm Graz for their weekend fixture and in a 6 goal epic, the visitors emerged as 4-2 victors. Dabbur was critical to this success, scoring two himself and putting forward a fantastic performance from start to finish."
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,01-Mar-18 09:26,"After a massively successful set of predictions last week (we managed to predict 3 of the 4 games while also mentioning the likelihood of an MLS match featuring), we move into this week and options are extremely thin. This is where we need to start thinking outside the box, investing in matches that carry a dual purpose (for example potential league SBC picks) and ultimately covering as many bases as possible.  
Last year we also saw a separate batch of European games included in their own marquee matchup challenge, so this is also a factor we should take into account and potentially prepare for as well. 

Manchester United vs Liverpool
First up this week we head over to England and the Premier League. Manchester United play host to Liverpool in a heated derby that would usually get my attention when it comes to marquee matchups. The only concern I have this time around is that Liverpool featured very recently and while we have seen EA repeat teams within a matter of weeks, it is still extremely rare. The bonus we have however is that the Premier League SBC is yet to drop and hence our investments have a dual-purpose here. 

Sevilla vs Valencia
Over to La Liga next and while this may not be a derby, the fact that both teams feature fairly high up in the league, coupled with the fact that La Liga didn't feature in the current challenge, we find ourselves with an outside chance of this game coming in. Whether EA decide to choose a random game from La Liga or not, we still have the potential of the league SBC dropping and once again our riskier investment carries a double use. 

Hellas Verona vs Chievo Verona
Next up we head over to Italy where we find a couple of teams a little further down the league going head to head in a heated derby. Hellas Verona play hosts to Chievo Verona in a match known only as the ""Derby della Scala"" or ""Verona Derby"". Investments here fit the mold of what marquee matchups should entail and hence getting in early and ensuring those discard prices is ideal. 

Rangers vs Celtic
We move onto the first selection of two from the Scottish Premier League and while we are including these within the predictions, we should be investing to sell into hype and not holding until the event is released. Rangers vs Celtic has already featured once this year and while seeing it pop up a second time isn't impossible (because its EA), it is extremely unlikely at best. Invest only at discard and sell into the hype. 

Hibernian FC vs Hearts
Our second game from the Scottish league now and again we immediately see a complication, Hearts recently(ish) featured within the SBC. As we mentioned before, this doesn't mean that we will not see this game feature, it just makes it that little bit less likely. The Edinburgh derby is a huge game in Scotland and hence demands respect. Investments are mainly made up of bronze and silver players, so if you can grab these guys for discard and sell into any hype, then you are laughing.

Heracles vs Twente
Over to Holland now where we find Heracles playing Twente in a derby known as the ""Twentse Derby"". Both sides sit comfortably in mid table and hence this match has little relevance on the remainder of the season. This being said, it carries the exact qualities that marquee matchups demand and this is the reason we are considering it today. Investing in covers yet another one of those matches that can turn a rather large profit if included, so follow the simple rules, get in early and aim for discard!

Huracan vs San Lorenzo
Our next stop sees us travelling to Argentina where we find sixth place Huracan playing hosts to third place San Lorenzo. With the lack of larger fixtures this week, all of these smaller matches stand a great chance of making the cut, the key is to diversify investments and not put all your eggs into one basket.

Swindon vs Cheltenham
Our final selection this week takes us back to where we started, back to England, however this time we are looking at League Two. This time we are looking at a fairly local derby, one from where I grew up, Swindon against Cheltenham in a West County derby. Investments here are nice and simple once more, aim for bronze and silver players at discard prices. These are cards you will likely have to hold and roll the dice with, the lack of exposure makes it a lesser known match and hence hype will be limited. 

Champions League Fixtures
As mentioned above, this is purely speculation and completely based on the challenges EA decided to release last year. We may see a mixture of both Champions League and Europa League games going forward, however focusing on these makes things a lot easier for now. Even if these fail to crop up over the next couple of weeks, at least we have planted the seed and will be prepared for when the competition hits the semi-finals! 

PSG vs Real Madrid
Liverpool vs Porto
Tottenham vs Juventus
Manchester City vs FC Basel
Roma vs Shakhtar Donetsk
Manchester United vs Sevilla
Besiktas vs Bayern Munich
Barcelona vs Chelsea"
REVIEW - TOTS LOZANO,21-May-18 06:09,"Hirving Rodrigo Lozano Bahena, better known as Satan, or God, depending on which team he is playing for.  From the moment Chucky Lozano earned his first inform he has been a go to super sub for numerous FUT Managers.  Terrorizing backlines with his pace and finishing ability that has resulted in numerous rants and/or humblebrags about epic comebacks. Which brings me to a confession; I seriously could not get on with either the 82 or 84 IF Lozano cards and I sold both shortly after buying them.  They were not as advertised and in my opinion were a result of massive overhype and circumstance. Perhaps they just didn’t fit my playstyle?  With the release of the new and improved 89 TOTS Lozano I was willing to subscribe to the “third times a charm” mentality and give him a final go.  But I couldn’t help but wonder; To sub, or not to sub: that is the question. 
I decided I would play Lozano in 20 matches.  15 as a starter. 5 as a super sub.  Through this process I hoped to determine his value in both situations and ultimately decided if I was a believer or non-believer in the third coming of Lozano.   Lozano was the lightning rod in the following squad:

 
PACE
The Mexican rattlesnake is always ready to strike opponents when they are vulnerable.  There are very few cards in FIFA 18 that have the acceleration that Lozano possess.  The second you go to accelerate he is moving and does not have the moment of hesitation that you will experience in some players.  Additionally, this card is very quick to react to loose balls and rebounds in and around the penalty area.  While I did not score any rebound goals in my 20 games with Lozano, I was able to keep many attacking chances alive that would later lead to goals.  It goes without saying that Lozano has pace to burn, but I noticed he has even more than other quick players I have used.
RATING: 5/5
 
SHOOTING
Now this was the category I was looking forward to when I purchased TOTS Lozano.  I have read the endless posts of people dominating with X number of goals in X number of games using Lozano.  As previously stated this was not my experience with past Lozano IFs and the main reason was a lack of finishing.  I would love to say that this version of Lozano was a revelation and I was ripping the net apart all Weekend League long.  But I can’t.  Once again I found Lozano’s finishing to be lack luster and should be goals were blasting past the posts and into the crowd endangering everyone.  One plus is that his FOUR STAR WEAK FOOT is really good and I ended up favouring his left near the end of my trial.  My parting word is that this is my first review where I did not finish the entire weekend league with a player I was reviewing and it was 100% due to Lozano’s finishing.
RATING: 3.5/5
 
PASSING
88 PASSING does not do Lozano’s ability on the ball justice and neither does the 9 assists in 20 games that his stats show.  Immediately I noticed a huge difference in Lozano’s passing from his previous IFs and this was the area he impacted my squad the most.  While he may not have played the final ball on all of my goals, it does not change the fact that Lozano’s passing is really solid and he can cut apart your opponents back line.  This card reminds me of SBC KDB in that sometimes the passes he plays are even better than I envisioned and always at the perfect weight that opposing defenders cannot get there.
RATING: 4/5
 
DRIBBLING, DEFENDING & PHYSICAL
I have read numerous reviews of the various Aguero cards and the comment they all have in common revolves about the player architype that you expect when you buy a card.  You expect Aguero’s card to be tiny and weak; and then you start a match and realize he looks solid and at least three or four inches taller than his card suggests.  Lozano has a similar architype and in the end he plays like he is 6 feet tall.  When you match this body type and the pace Lozano has, his dribbling, defending, and physical make him a well-rounded weapon for any squad to unleash.  One example I can share is that I usually average 1 penalty during a full Weekend League.  This weekend, I had 5 in the 20 games I played with Lozano and all of them were fouls on him.  The best compliment I can give this card is that Lozano dribbles like a 5’8 speedster, which he is.  But then you look at the player architype and you realize you have a tank flying around the pitch causing havoc.  His 74 STRENGTH is a complete farce and I was tossing defenders around the pitch like Hulk Hogan in his prime.  The amount of headers, tackles, and shoulder challenges that I won this weekend with Lozano was not fair.  He should not be winning the majority of these battles, but he does anyway.
DRIBBLING RATING: 5/5
DEFENDING RATING: 4/5
PHYSICAL RATING: 4/5

FINALE SCORE
RATING: 3.8/5
As foreshadowed earlier in my review, my rating is not flattering for TOTS Lozano and I still can’t get on with this card.  There are so many players worth 200k or less that are the same or better (84 IF Lozano for instance).  If I was in the driver’s seat and dominating my opponent: Lozano was banging in hat tricks.  If the game was close and a chance broke for my ST: Lozano was slamming shots off the face of un-expecting fans.  I cannot recommend this card with the inflated price tag it has; and while I know there are FUT Mangers out there lighting the world on fire with this card, I suggest that they are good enough that they could do the same with anyone else.  TOTS Lozano does not improve your squad the way so many other options can.  However, I do want to spend a few seconds on one part of Lozano that was incredible, and most would expect it goes the other way, however... TOTS Arias is unbelievable!  I think he rivals and surpasses 85 IF Valencia and that is a massive shout.  I could not get over how effective this card was and I repeat, he would surpass my Valencia in the starting lineup if he linked better.  In the end the hard link to TOTS Arias is the only reason I was contemplating holding on to Lozano, and even that wasn’t enough.  In conclusion, send me your hybrids with TOTS Arias.
Cheers for reading!
 
Game Stats:


 
Game Highlights:"
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,09-Feb-18 08:24,"With a couple of leagues taking a break this week and the distinct lack of larger matches or derbies taking place, it almost feels as if our predictions are lacking in volume. This being said, we are facing the knockout stages of the Champions League and if history repeats itself, we could be seeing a separate batch of challenges revolving around just them.

Torino vs Juventus
First up this week we head over to Italy, where we find 10th place Torino play hosts to 2nd place Juventus in a rivalry known as the “Derby della Mole”. The match features Turin’s most prominent clubs and dates back years and years. Investments here are nice and simple, gold players are available in abundance for both sides, making our selection process easy.

Gladbach vs Dortmund
Over to Germany next where we find 8th place Gladbach playing hosts to 4th place Dortmund and with just 3 points separating the two clubs, and Champions League spots up for grabs, three points here is a must. If my memory is correct, Gladbach featured fairly recently which may hinder their chances of cropping up again, however we have seen teams feature multiple times in a short window and hence cannot ignore this game. Investments around big clubs in a big league offer plenty of gold players, so take your pick and pay discard value!

Vitoria Guimaraes vs Sporting Braga
Now to to Portugal where we find Guimaraes playing hosts to Braga in a derby known as “Derbi do Minho”. Now this time the Wikipedia page isn’t in English, so sadly we are lacking some interesting facts here, but fear not as we can still talk investments! With players available for all rarities, keep it simple, aim for discard though!

Norwich vs Ipswich
Over to England now where we find Norwich and Ipswich going head to head in the “East Anglian Derby”. Now it is vital to take note that this has already featured once this year, leaving it highly unlikely that it crops up again. However, hype is key when it comes to investments and people will buy to simply be prepared. If you choose to go down this route, I advise spending no more than discard on any card you purchase!

Young Boys vs Thun
Finally we head over to Switzerland where Young Boys play hosts to Thun in the Burner Derby. If I recall, we are yet to see this league feature within Marquee Matchups and hence this leaves us with an exciting prospect. Like most of our options this week, hype is likely to inflate their prices prior to the event. If you find yourself attempting to buy too late, ensure you are sniping and bidding to bring down the cost.

Champions League
As mentioned before, last year during the knockout stages of the Champions League, EA released two separate Marquee Matchup Challenges, each featuring 4 games. As the fixtures are spread across two legs, we could be seeing them pop up at any point over the next month.
It is also important to mention that although we talk about Champions League, we did see games from the Europa League featuring as well and hence keeping an eye on these fixtures wouldn’t hurt either.
Juventus vs Tottenham
Chelsea vs Barcelona
Real Madrid vs PSG
Porto vs Liverpool"
TOTW 32 Predictions,23-Apr-18 11:56,"Starting Eleven
Areola 
With PSG flying high atop the table, you would expect them to pick up a comfortable win away to Bordeaux. Now while they picked up the win, it was anything but comfortable and if it wasn’t for Areola making 8 incredible saves, the result could have gone very differently.
Smalling 
Manchester United we’re away to Bournemouth for their midweek league game and ever since their Champions League exit, they are a team on fire. Smalling has been a huge part of this, both defensively and going forward and once again he showed what he is capable of with a goal and clean sheet here.
Koulibaly 
With the season coming to a close, the Seria A is far from wrapped up. Napoli sat 4 points behind league leaders Juventus, and with the two sides facing off a win here would have seen the gap reduced to a mere point. Napoli made sure this became a reality, a 90th minute winner from Koulibaly was all that could separate the two teams. A clean sheet and such an important goal has to be enough for a second inform, right?
Lomban 
Ronal were on the road for their midweek La Liga game and in an incredibly tight fixture, they just managed to edge a 1-0 victory over their hosts, Espanyol. Lomban was the hero on the night, as not only was he incredible defensively, he also provided the only goal of the game.
Brozovic
Inter Milan were hosts to Cagliari for their Tuesday night fixture and with a dominating display of football, the hosts wrapped up all the points with a 4-0 win. Now while Cancelo at right-back has a shot, with a goal and clean sheet, our nomination goes with Brozovic. A goal, an assist and man of the match could very well be enough for yet another Inform.
Rudy 
With Bayern having already wrapped up the Bundesliga, the remaining fixtures hold little relevance, and with their Champions League fixture around the corner, we can expect to see players rested. These changes however weren’t noticeable on the pitch, as they still sailed to a 3-0 win, with Rudy scoring once and assisting a second.
Milinkovic-Savic 
Now this was a tough one, during Lazio’s 4-0 win over Sampdoria there were several strong candidates for this nomination. Immobile, with 2 goals, De Vrij, with a goal and a clean sheet to his name, however we opted to go with Savic once again. With a goal, an assist and the man of the match award, this man gets our vote once more.
Reus
Dortmund were comfortable 4-0 winners over Leverkusen on the weekend, and while Reus may have not been the most impressive on the pitch, he is the man who gets our vote. Sancho secured a near perfect rating, with a goal and two assists, however as he doesn’t feature in FIFA, Reus with two goals (and a missed penalty), could sneak his way into the lineup instead.
Thauvin 
Marseille were hosts to Lille for their Ligue 1 fixture on Saturday, and although the game provided 6 goals, only one went in favour of the visitors. Mitriglou up top scored twice, and could easily take this spot, however Thauvin is our nomination with two goals and a fantastic overall performance.
Bernardo Silva 
We take a bit of a gamble with this selection, and pick a player who has been impressive across the season, but has failed to have that one incredible match as far as goals scored are concerned. Man City cruised to a 5-0 over Swansea on the weekend, and once again Bernardo Silva was incredible. Now while he only scored the one goal, there is a chance that when we add this to his man of the match performance, that he just makes the cut.
Lacazette 
Now this is something that felt near impossible over the past few months. Lacazette has really struggled to maintain the form we see in France, however slowly and steadily he seems to be on his way back. Arsenal picked up a 4-1 win over West Ham on Sunday, and with two goals to his name, we could be seeing his first inform of the year.
 
Substitutes
Puggioni 
This week there were plenty of fantastic goalkeeper performances, and picking just two was incredibly difficult. Benevento were away to AC Milan and in an incredible show of strength, they secured the points with a 1-0 win. Puggioni was incredible in goal, with 6 fantastic saves and amazing control of his back line.
Maria 
Twente were at home to PEC Zwolle for their match this week and in a solid performance across the board, they picked up a 2-0 win. Now all the attention has to be directed at their defenders, the centre-backs were amazing and both full-backs provided a goal, and although Maria gets our vote, this could easily go to anyone in the back line.
Veretout 
We come across another slightly unusual selection here, not for what Veretout accomplished, but due to the match result. Fiorentina picked up a loss during a 4-3 defeat to Lazio, however his performance simply cannot go unnoticed. Scoring all 3 goals for Fiorentina, he has to be in with a shot, despite his side actually losing the game.
Regattin
Osmanlispor were on the road to Genclerbirligi for their weekend fixture, and in a game that provided 3 goals, all of them went to the visitors. Regattin was a man in form, scoring twice and terrorising the oppositions defence throughout.
Russell 
Over to the MLS now where Kansas City were comfortable 6-0 winners against Vancouver. Now there were plenty of standout performances, but Russell was definitely the most impressive. After securing a hat-trick and a perfect match rating, this man simply has to make the cut.
Jahanbakhsh 
AZ Alkmaar Player hosts to Vitesse mid-week and in a 7 goal thriller, it was the home side who just managed to edge the win. Jahanbakhsh was the hero on the day, not only did he secure himself a hat-trick, but he also provided the assist for the fourth goal. Ignoring him this time would be nothing short of a crime.
Neres 
Ajax were at home to VVV-Venlo on Thursday and in yet another magnificent performance, they wrapped up the points with a 4-1 win. Neres was simply unstoppable throughout, providing 1 assist, 2 goals and being denied by the woodwork for another.
Piatti
Back across to America now, where we find yet another high scoring fixture. Montreal lost 3-5 at home to LAFC, and with the way the visitors played, it comes as no surprise. Piatti was simply unstoppable, scoring twice from open play and once from the spot to secure his hat-trick.
Uth
Hoffenheim and Leipzig went head to head for their Bundesliga clash on the weekend and in a game that provided 7 goals, it was the visitors who left with all the points. The match ended 5-2 and Uth not only secured a near perfect Match rating, but also hammered home twice and provided an assists on another.
Robinson
Over to the lower English divisions now, where Southend played hosts to MK Dons. It was pure domination from start to finish, with the hosts picking up a comfortable 4-0 win in the end. Robinson was the man of the match, scoring not once, not twice, but three times to secure his hat-trick.
Musa 
After two assists mid-week, people were already speculating about the possibility of an Inform for this man, but after CSKA’s 2-1 win on the weekend, surely that debate is wrapped up. Musa added to those assists with two goals on Saturday, which will surely secure his space in this week’s team.
Remy 
Getafe were away to Valencia for their La Liga clash this week, and in an incredibly tight match, they just managed to secure the points with a 2-1 victory. Remy was the star on the night, scoring both their goals and giving himself a real chance at an Inform this week.

MARQUEE MATCHUPS,04-May-18 05:01,"As the season comes to a close, we are starting to see a lot of cups coming to a close. With this, we have different possible routes that Marquee Matchups could take. Will we see the usual domestic routes feature, or will EA take a slight spin and start to filter in some of the cup finals? Well, when it comes to investing, the decision is yours, but let’s cover both bases just to cover our options!
 
Domestic Matches

Roma vs Juventus
First up we have league leaders Juventus away to Champions League semi-finalists, Roma. After Napoli’s slip up last week, the Serie A title is all but wrapped up for Juventus, however a loss here against Roma could leave them needing a win in the final match to secure the trophy. Investments here are always going to be gold players, however, consider which team is likely to rise more with demand.
 
Real Betis vs Sevilla
Next up we find a Spanish derby that features, 5th place Real Betis and 9th place Sevilla. The fixture between the two sides goes by the name of the “Seville Derby”, due to the location of both clubs being in Seville. Plenty of gold investments once again, just consider both rating and nationality when choosing your targets. Keep in mind that we saw a La Liga match feature last week, and EA usually don’t repeat leagues.

Girondins de Boudreaux vs Toulouse
Over to France now, where Girondins and Toulouse go head to head in a match known as the “Derby de la Garonne”. The fixture takes this name due to both sides being part of the largest cities, along the Garonne river. There should be enough gold players available at discard, however if prices begin to rise, aiming for lower quality cards shouldn’t hurt.
 
Dinamo Moscow vs Spartak Moscow
Russia is our next destination, where we find 12th place Dinamo Moscow playing host to second place Spartak Moscow. This time we don’t need Wikipedia to understand where this rivalry originated from, both sides are from Moscow and hence a rivalry was naturally created! Plenty of gold cards here, aim for discard and play it safe.
 
Portland Timbers vs Seattle Sounders
America is our next destination, and while we have seen the MLS feature recently in marquee matchups, I wouldn’t rule out a speedy return. Portland and Seattle go head to head this week in a rivalry that dates back years. Many fans consider this to be one of the most heated rivalries in American football, and originates back to the 70’s. Investments here should be bought at discard, silvers are ideal, although there is no shame in buying bronzes if required.
 
Hearts vs Hibernian
The Scottish playoffs continue this week and while there are a range of matches available, our selection goes with the Edinburgh Derby, a match that has been previously overlooked by EA. Investments here are once again nice and simple, silver or bronze cards, for discard prices.

Ratings Refresh,21-Jan-18 19:29,"At the start of a new FIFA, each player is allocated a rating based on their real-world footballing achievements, talents and level. Now as you all probably know, just because a player had a fantastic season the previous year, this certainly doesn't mean this form will always continue and hence ratings can feel unrealistic at times. This is the reason EA introduced their ""Ratings Refresh"".  Usually EA runs Rating Refresh mid February.
During this article, we will discuss exactly what this consists of, how the changes affect both current and new cards and we will then be releasing predictions around upcoming rating increases and decreases! Keep in mind, we are using the same system that EA used in the previous year, therefore everything is based around that structure. If they were to change this system, then the examples and predictions would change alongside this. 
 
Non-Inform Cards (NIF) 
Players who have had a particularly impressive season will receive a brand-new NIF card in packs with an increased rating, while those who have been extremely lack-luster will receive new NIF cards with reduced ratings. 
For example: 
Player A had a solid season last year scoring 12 goals and was therefore given an 82-rated NIF card this year in FIFA. So far this season Player A has really improved their game, they have already scored 14 goals and have been an incredibly valuable asset to the team. Due to this consistent improvement, EA decide to refresh their rating and a new 82-rated NIF card is released into packs while the older 82-rated NIF card is removed. 
Player B had an incredible season last year, scoring 30 goals and helping his team win the title. Based on this incredible display last year an 87-rated NIF card was awarded to the player. This year however they are really struggling to find their feet and at the halfway mark in the season they have only found the back of the net 9 times and have often gone missing during games. Due to this change in form, EA decide to refresh their rating and a new 85-rated NIF card is released into packs while the older 87-rated NIF card is removed. 
It is important to remember that previous copies of NIF cards will NOT be removed from the game, cards you currently own will remain the same, they will simply not appear in packs anymore and hence instantly become a lot rarer. 

Inform Cards (IF) and Other Special Cards
Over the past few months, since the release of FIFA 18, players have been receiving special cards through events such as TOTW. These cards not only have a beautiful design with a dynamic picture, but they also provide boosted stats along with a higher overall rating when compared to their regular NIF cards. So, what happens to these special cards if a player receives a rating boost? Will they immediately drop in value as their new NIF card is suddenly just as good? Luckily for us, the answer here is no. Players who currently have a special card who then receive a boost from this refresh, will also see their special card receiving a boost. 
Upgrade example: 
Player A has had a fantastic season so far. Their NIF card is 82-rated, their first inform is 84-rated and their second inform is 86-rated. EA announce that Player A will be receiving a +2 increase to his NIF card, moving it up to 84-rated overall. From this point we calculate the ratings on these special cards, using the NIF rating of 84 as our starting point. The 84 rated inform moves up to an 86-rated card, while the 86-rated card increases to an 87-rated one. This ensures that nobody loses any value based on these refreshes. Here is an example using Sterling’s potential +2 Upgrade. EA would issue a new 84-rated NIF card and upgrade both of his informs like this:
 

 
Downgrade example:
Player B has had a really poor season so far, despite an inform from his very first game, they have really disappointed during all other matches. Due to this, EA decides to provide a –1 rating during the refresh, changing their 82-rated NIF into an 81-rated NIF card. As we mentioned before, Player B currently has an inform which is 84-rated, but luckily for us the refresh on their NIF card has absolutely no effect on any cards currently in the game. Nothing here changes except for the rating of the players NIF cards available in packs. 

How These Changes Can Affect the Player base 
When a player receives a new rating during this event, the prices of their other cards will change accordingly. If the player receives a new NIF with an improved rating, it is likely the price of their older card will drop a little while if they receive a new NIF with a decreased rating, their older card will likely rise. These changes are simply due to supply and demand, the cards with the most impressive stats will be in higher demand and hence carry a premium price tag. 
For Example: 
Player A has an 82-rated NIF card and during the rating refresh they receive a +2 upgrade. Suddenly their new 84-rated card is the only one available in packs and due to the rating still being fairly low, this card is packed a lot. Over a short period of time this 84-rated card will offer a very affordable upgrade to the 82-rated card and hence the 82-rated card will drop in price. 
Player B has an 84-rated NIF card and during the rating refresh they receive a –2 downgrade. Now that the only card available in packs is an 82-rated one, this 84-rated card immediately carries a premium price-tag. The older card is no longer available and hence supply is limited which will likely cause the price to increase over time. 
Player C has an 88-rated NIF card and during the rating refresh they receive a +1 upgrade. Higher tier cards already carry a hefty price tag and due to their use for both teams and SBC's they can never really fall that far. If anything, the 88-rated NIF will see a small increase in price overtime due to the limited availability and possible uses it provides. 
Player D has an 88-rated NIF card and during the rating refresh they receive a –2 downgrade. This scenario follows the same principal as Player B. The card instantly becomes a lot rarer while the demand remains consistent or even increases. In this situation we can expect the 88-rated card to rise in price. 
Player E has an 82-rated NIF card and an 84-rated IF card. During the rating refresh they receive a +2 upgrade. Thanks to this upgrade on their NIF card, the IF also sees a boost. Suddenly an 84-rated inform becomes an 86-rated inform and hence immediately carries a larger price tag. These are great possible investments if you can correctly predict upgrades and invest at a solid price. 
Player F has an 84-rated NIF card and an 86-rated IF card. During the rating refresh they receive a –2 downgrade. The inform card has no change to stats and hence is very unlikely to change in price. 

Predictions 
For the next few days we will be releasing our Rating Refresh Predictions, based on career mode and the changes we can visibly see in game already! Make sure you follow FUTBIN on twitter and also keep your eyes peeled on the News section for updates."
Review - FUT Birthday Florenzi,20-Mar-18 09:13,"The much anticipated FUT Birthday promo dropped March 15 and needless to say the card choices were not disappointing.  Amongst the movement of players was the exciting prospect of a RB to CM Florenzi.  The first issue was getting my hands on this card to review in the first place.  Florenzi’s card was extinct shortly after release, which makes sense given the 400k maximum price range, insanely upgraded stats as a CM, and the hype around FUT Birthday in general.
After securing the Italian Kante I was met with two more obstacles; which chemistry style and position combination would generate the greatest output in my squad.  What gift do you buy the man who has everything?  After a small trial and error sample set I settled on FINISHER as the best option; I found Florenzi’s most notable contributions came in any formation with advanced CMs.  Florenzi was the engine room in the following squad:



PACE
Immediately, Florenzi felt familiar in my midfield.  It took a game to put my finger on it, but the movement Florenzi demonstrates mimics that of SIF Ake.  He is gliding around the pitch and does not seem bothered by the “quicksand” that can affect teams.  He can track runners, pull away from would be defenders, and exploit any space on the pitch with his pace.  He is deceivingly quick defensively as well and broke up numerous plays throughout the weekend.    
RATING: 5/5
 
SHOOTING
Game 1-5 I was testing out an ANCHOR chemistry style and experiencing poor results with Florenzi’s shooting.  Zero goals.  Discouraging for sure, yet I was so happy with the rest of his game I could overlook this issue with minimal frustration.  However, FINISHER was a game changer and revealed a completely new player.  Mix in the pace with solid long shots and you have a recipe to pull defenders out of position and speaks to the assist return he produced.
RATING: 4/5
 
PASSING
Despite the review order I found myself have to skip the passing commentary until this article was finished.  On the surface Florenzi’s passing is just about everything you would want in a CM.  Maybe he falls short of a few top tier comparisons, but you can’t complain about his overall performances.  The problem I faced reviewing this stat is how incredibly effective his passing was for me in this formation.  The space I would have in the midfield because of the pace in this card made executing passes easier than I have experienced with other midfielders.  Mix in a long range shot (goal or otherwise) and players have to respect the goal threat and step out resulting in added passing options.  In the end I looked at the stats.  No other player in my squad has an assist every two games.  Sometimes the answer is the obvious choice right in front of you.
RATING: 4.5/5
 
DRIBBLING
Florenzi is definitely a North to South dribbler.  The pace he travels at means that the slightest touch past a defender is lights out. East to West is a bit of a different story and would be my only major complaint about this card.  Turns in traffic felt like I was in a stop motion video clip while my opponent continued to move in real time resulting in some frustrating possession loss.  Much like the shooting issues mentioned before.  Sometimes you have to accept small flaws when there are so many positives.
RATING: 4/5
 
DEFENDING & PHYSICAL
Consider the fact that Florenzi is a RB transferred to the CM position, with an in game stat boost of 180, and this section writes itself. With the FINISHER chemistry style attached I noticed zero drop off in defensive output compared to ANCHOR earlier on.  Florenzi is quick, agile, strong in the tackle, and can pressure any top midfielders off of the ball.  On the other hand a 5’8 midfielder can be discouraging for many FUT Managers when completing a team.  I was shocked at the amount of headers he won in the midfield for me this weekend.  Maybe it is the jumping stats when you add FINISHER?  Maybe it is a mixture of positioning and interceptions? Regardless, it was a noteworthy bonus that I was not expecting at the start of the weekend.  Finally, you mix in 99 STAMINA and Florenzi really was the engine in my squad.  He has everything you want in a box to box midfielder and outshines other cards I have used by a noticeable margin.
RATING: 5/5
 
IT FACTOR
The IT factor is not a statistic you can look up in game or on FUTBIN.  Regardless, I strongly feel as though it is the single most important factor in purchasing and then keeping any player for my squad.  By this point in FIFA 18 most FUT managers will know exactly what I mean. Some players just have IT, and are worth every hard earned coin.  You don’t care if their price dipped 100k overnight because you know they are going to be in your team for months.  Florenzi is that player.  I bought him to review for 20 games and ended up with a player that I have made significant squad changes in order to accommodate.  There was a noticeable difference in my squad’s performance this weekend and this card was the driving force.
RATING: 4.5/5
 
FINAL SCORE
RATING: 4.5/5
For the second review running I am quite happy with the final outcome of the ratings average.  I immediately felt like this card is a game changer, but there are still better options available if you have deep pockets to purchase them.  Bang for your buck, I do not think there are many better options.  I referred to Florenzi as the Italian Kante and given their weak foot, dribbling, height, and general in-game statistics they are a good comparison.  Which brings me to the “people might call me crazy” portion of the review.  When I say the comparisons to Kante are close I am not talking about his 88 rated base card.  I actually mean his TOTY card.  Now before you lock me up and through away the key I am not saying that Florenzi is by any means as effective as TOTY Kante.  What I mean is, for 400k (prior to a price range update that may even drop his price) you are getting a midfielder who can hold his own against a 1.3 million coin midfielder.  I went into numerous games this WL where my team was way underpowered compared to my opposition, and I continually walked away thinking, “I didn’t get played off the pitch there”.  Florenzi was like a tug boat all weekend long as he dragged my team through the murky waters that WL can be.  I have not found a player in FIFA 18 who has such a profound effect in every third of the pitch throughout a match.  If you can get your hands on this card I would definitely give him a shot.  As for me, I am sold.  
Cheers for reading!

Game Highlights:"
TOTW18 Predictions,15-Jan-18 15:43,"Starting Eleven
Schmeichel 
Last years league winners were hosts to the winners from the year before when Chelsea met Leicester on the weekend. In an incredibly tight game, neither team could edge out the opposition with the match ending in a 0-0 draw. Despite Chelsea’s best efforts, Schmeichel was simply too good on the day, pulling off a total of 7 saves and ensuring a clean sheet was kept.
Sorensen 
FC Cologne were hosts were hosts to Borussia M’Gladbach for their Bundesliga fixture and in an incredibly tight game, it was the hosts who emerged as the 2-1 victors. Sorensen at RB is the player who gets the nod today, a goal and solid performance at the back could very well be enough.
Evans 
West Brom were at home to Brighton for their weekend fixture and with the relegation battle really heating up, three points were something both sides really wanted. This time it was the hosts who secured the points, in a 2-0 victory it was the defensive line that scored both while keeping a clean sheet. Evans is the man who takes this spot, with a goal from the CB role.
Sokratis 
Defenders can be tough to predict and we usually see EA through a couple in to simply pump up the quality in this area. Using this logic, we move onto our next match between Dortmund and Wolfsburg. The match ended 0-0, and while Sokratis may not have scored or assisted, the solid display may just be enough.
Aurier 
This next pick is a controversial one, and with Son being featured later in these predictions, it makes this selection even more of a long shot. Tottenham obliterated Everton 4-0, and Aurier with a clean sheet and an assist, gives himself a chance of squeezing in due to lack of competition from defenders elsewhere.
Rodriguez 
Over to the Bundesliga now where league leaders Bayern were away to Leverkusen. The match provided us with 4 goals, which sadly for Leverkusen were not split evenly. In a 3-1 win for Bayern, Rordriguez gets the selection today. With 1 goal, 1 assist and a fantastic performance, could we see this OTW card finally receive a boost?
Lanzini 
West Ham were away to Huddersfield on the weekend and with the relegation battle really heating up, three points was once again a minimum requirement here. Luckily the whole team understood this and in a fantastic performance they left as 4-1 winners. Lanzini playing at CAM was fantastic on the day, scoring twice and taking the man of the match award.
Thauvin 
Marseille were away to Rennes in Ligue 1, and once again it was the travelling side who stole the show. Thauvin is our selection from this match, after missing from the spot, he went on to score, assist and dominate the match. Could we be seeing a second Inform just in time for TOTY?
Son 
Tottenham played hosts to an out of form Everton on the weekend where in a dominating display and a 4-0 victory, it was once again Kane who stole the show. With him likely to be in this TOTY and with a POTM card currently up for grabs, it is unlikely to see him make the cut and hence we turn our attention to Son. With 1 goal and an assist, could we be seeing or lord return once more?
Oxlade-Chamberlain 
Unbeaten and according to most unbeatable Manchester City were away to Liverpool for their weekend fixture, where in a 7 goal thriller, the impossible finally happened. Liverpool took the game to the league leaders and in a 4-3 victory finally ended hopes of an unbeaten season. Chamberlain was the player who shined the brightest, scoring the first, assisting another and simply putting forward one hell of a performance.
Suarez 
Barcelona were on the road again for their La Liga match and after Real Sociedad took a 2-0 lead, things were looking bleak. A superb second half performance saw Barcelona win the game 4-2, with Suarez scoring twice and assisting a third. With it looking extremely unlikely he makes the TOTY, maybe a second Inform will be the next best thing.
 
Substitutes
Moulin 
Saint-Etienne were at home to Toulouse for their Sunday fixture in Ligue 1, and in a 2-0 victory for the hosts, it wasn’t those who scored the goals that ensured the win. Moulin, standing tall in goal, was the real hero of the night. With a total of 8 fantastic saves, he really ensured that the clean sheet was kept and that the home side took all 3 points.
Maignan 
Lille were away to Caen for their Ligue 1 fixture, and during their 1-0 triumph, there was one man who ensured they left with the points. With a total of 15 shots for the hosts and 7 saves for Maignan, the clean sheet was secured and hence he has rightfully earned his spot in these predictions.
Cala 
Getafe were hosts to Malaga for their La Liga clash on Friday, and in a game consisting of a single goal, it was the Home side who took all the points. Cala at the back was the man of the hour, a clean sheet and the winning goal might just be enough to see him take his place in this week’s team.
Talocha 
Back to Portugal now where Boavista hosted Portimonense in the Liga Nos. in a comfortable 2-0 performance, Talocha at LB managed to not only keep a clean sheet but also got his name on the scoresheet to really help boost his chances this week.
Kaminski 
Stuttgart were at home to Hertha Berlin for their Bundesliga clash on the weekend, and in a match of very few chances, a single goal won the game, an own goal. Kaminski however was extremely solid at the back for the hosts and due to this, he has his space in these predictions.
Paterson 
Cardiff were hosts to Sunderland in the second tier of English football and in a dominating performance they took all the points in a 4-0 victory. Paterson from the CM spot was the star of this show, scoring twice and controlling the midfield with ease.
Murilo 
Over to the Portuguese league now, where Tondela were hosts to Feirense. In a controlling performance, Tondela left as 3-1 winners with Murilo from the midfield scoring two of the three goals.
Ward-Prowse 
Southampton were away to Watford for their Premier League match and in a game of four goals, neither side could quite edge out a victory. Ward Prowse however did everything he could, and after scoring twice to put his side 2-0 up, he must be devastated to not take the three points.
Davidson 
Chaves were hosts to Vitoria De Guimaraes for their Friday night fixture and in a 7 goal thriller, it was the home side who took all the points. Goals were split evenly for Chaves, with Tiba scoring two from the spot and Davidson scoring two from open play.
Moreno 
Valencia were away to Deportivo for their weekend La Liga clash, and in a 2-1 victory we are left with two possible TOTW candidates. Both Guedes and Moreno secured a single goal and assist in the match, but as Guedes already has an Inform, our selection is with Moreno and his Path To Glory card.
Ibe
Bournemouth were hosts to a struggling Arsenal for their weekend fixture and after going down 1-0 it looked like their weekend was going to be a poor one. Fate had other ideas though, and a struggling Arsenal found themselves with yet another loss after Bournemouth turned things around and picked up a 2-1 victory. Ibe was sensational, scoring one of the goals and bossing the attack.
Fullkrug
Over to the Bundesliga now where Hannover were hosts to Mainz in a 5 goal thriller. Hannover took the points in a 3-2 victory, with one man scoring each and every goal for the hosts. With 2 from open play and 1 from the spot, Fullkrug secures his spot in this week’s predictions."
TOTW28 Predictions,26-Mar-18 17:23,"Starting Eleven
Pickford 
England were away to Holland for their international friendly and in an incredibly tight game, it was the visitors who stole the win. The match ended 1-0 and despite Holland having 13 shots, with 6 on target, Pickford ensured the clean sheet.
Layun 
Mexico were hosts to Iceland on Saturday and in a dominating performance they left as 3-0 winners. Layun was the man of the hour with a clean sheet and 2 goals, including one in the final seconds.
Miranda
Brazil are in fine form at the moment and when they travelled to World Cup hosts Russia for their friendly, they showed this once again. In a comfortable 3-0 win, Miranda not only ensured a clean sheet was kept but also scored one of the goals.
Moses
Nigeria were on the road to Poland on Friday and in an incredibly tight game, they edged out the hosts as 1-0 winners. The only goal of the game came from the spot, with Moses converting it and when we add this to his clean sheet, he has a real chance of another Inform in an incredibly quiet week.
Wanyama 
Kenya were hosts to Comoros for their international fixture and in a game of four goals, the match ended all square at 2-2. Wanyama was the man of the hour for Kenya, scoring once from the spot and a second from open play.
Vidal
Chile were away to Sweden for their fixture and in an incredibly tight game, it was the visitors who edged out a 2-1 victory. Vidal was solid in midfield as usual and when we consider the opening was scored by him too, then we have another possible contender on our hands.
James Rodriguez 
Colombia were away to an incredibly strong French side and after going 2-0 down, the predictable outcome looked certain to happen. Colombia bravely fought back however with the match ending 3-2 to the visitors. Rodriguez was fantastic bagging two assists to ensure his side won.
Arnautovic 
Austria were at home to Slovenia on Friday and in a strong showing, they left as 3-0 winners. Arnautovic may not be on form for his club, however he had no problems finding the net for his country. Scoring twice and securing the man of the match award simply has to be enough for another Inform.
Quaresma
Portugal were at home to Egypt for their weekend clash and after Salah put the visitors ahead, things began to look bleak. Egypt still led at 90 minutes however Portugal were far from finished. Ronaldo bagged two in the final seconds, which won’t be enough for him to make the cut, however both assists came from Quaresma and this guy has a fantastic chance of making the list.
Bale 
Wales were on the road to China on Thursday and unlike most of the matches taking place, this one was anything but close. The visitors destroyed their opposition with the match ending 6-0 and while Vokes has a chance with 2 goals, our nomination has to go with Bale who secured himself a hat-trick.

Cavani 
Uruguay were at home to Czech Republic for their first fixture and it was the hosts who took the win. Both Suarez and Cavani scored in a 2-0 victory and while both may be a slightly long shot, Cavani makes our list simply due to the lack of competition.

Substitutes
Medjani 
Algeria were hosts to Tanzania for their Thursday night clash and in a game of 5 goals, it was the hosts who scored 4. Now while Medjani may not have kept a clean sheet a strong performance and a goal from this Defender may just be enough this week.
Steres 
LA Galaxy were away to Vancouver for their MLS clash and although the match ended 0-0, there were some solid defensive displays. Steres was like a rock at the back, locking down the opposition and ensuring a clean sheet was kept.
Lanzini 
Argentina were away to Italy for their friendly and despite Buffons best efforts, it was the visitors who left as 2-0 winners. Lanzini scored one of the goals and what a fantastic goal it was. When we couple this with the difficulty of the opponent and his performance throughout, we could see a second Inform for the young Argentinian.
Ayite 
Togo and Ivory Coast went head to head on Saturday and in a four goal thriller, the match ended 2-2. Although four goals were scored, there were only two goal scorers and in this tough week, we see both feature. First up we have Ayite who scored twice for Togo.
Sisto
Denmark were at home to Panama for their Thursday night fixture and in a game of just a single goal, it was the hosts who left victorious. Sisto was the man who scored this and with a solid performance throughout too, he may have just done enough.
Pepe 
As mentioned before Togo and Ivory Coast drew 2-2. Pepe was the man on fire for the visitors, scoring both of their goals and hence making our shortlist.
Topal
Turkey played hosts to Ireland for their weekend clash and once again it was a game of very few goals. The hosts edged out a 1-0 win and Topal was the man who found the back of the net. Usually this wouldn’t be enough, but in such a awkward week, anything can happen!
Kamara 
Norway were hosts to Australia in the week and it was the hosts who stole the show in a 4-1 victory. Kamara was the man of the hour scoring not once, not twice, but three times to secure his hat-trick.
Martinez
Columbus were at home to DC United for their MLS clash and in a match of four goals, it was the hosts who secured the points. The game ended 3-1 and although Martinez didn’t score, he provided two assists and was the best player on the pitch.
Wright-Phillips 
New York were at home to Minnesota United for their MLS clash and in a dominating display, the hosts took all the points. The match ended 3-0 and Wright Phillips was the man who bagged two of them.
McNulty
Coventry were hosts to Grimsby and after a terrific performance, they left as 4-0 winners. McNulty was a man with a mission, scoring three to ensure a hat-trick along with the man of the match award.
Pitman 
Portsmouth were comfortable 3-0 winners against Oxford on Sunday and Pitman was the star of the show. Scoring twice and running the match from start to finish, he has a serious chance of a second Inform here."
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,16-Nov-17 16:29,"AS Monaco vs PSG 
First up today we head over to Ligue 1 for a top of the table clash between first place PSG and second place AS Monaco. While this may not be a derby, we have seen EA opt to include various matches between top clubs this year and this is the sole reason why this makes the list. When investing consider which players have a more limited supply and are hence likely to rise the most, the current Madrid Marquee Matchup is a prime example of this logic in action.
Stade Rennais vs FC Nantes 
Keeping things in the same league for this choice, and the first point to consider is that EA have never chosen two games from the same league, so we shouldn’t be expecting both this and the Monaco/PSG game to feature. Again, we head back to Wikipedia for our sources here and this match between Stade Rennais and FC Nantes is known as the Derby De La Bretagne (Derby Breton). Investing in either of these Ligue 1 games slightly helps invest in the other, considering the positions and rarity of the cards is crucial once again.
Spartak Moscow vs Zenit 
For our next choice we head over to the Russian league, a league that has received very little love from EA within the Marquee Matchup selections so far. Fifth place Spartak Moscow play host to second place Zenit in this heated match, and while again it may not be a derby, the match carries significance importance due to how tight the battle is atop the table. Investing here is as simple as always, aim for the highest rated card, in a sought-after position, for the lowest possible cost, simple!
Dortmund vs Schalke 
Moving over to the Bundesliga now where the selection features Dortmund and Schalke in a derby known only as the Revierderby (Ruhr Derby). While this game ticks all the boxes on a normal week, the fact that we have recently seen Dortmund feature puts me off a little, but then again, I said the same thing about Atletico Madrid and look where that got us!
Columbus Crew SC vs Toronto FC 
Heading over to the MLS next where Columbus Crew take on Toronto in this playoff match. The backstory to this derby provided by Wikipedia is glorious and I would highly recommend reading, but to cut a long story short, the Trillium Cup is an annual two team rivalry between these guys. Looking to invest here is fairly simple, gold players are fairly scarce, so immediately we are aiming at silver players for discard and failing that bronze.
Liverpool vs Chelsea 
Another big match in the Premier League again this week and we see the mighty Liverpool play host to Chelsea. While on any normal week I would have given this game a real chance of inclusion, my gut tells me that we have seen this league feature a lot recently and due to the fact that Arsenal and Tottenham are in the current SBC, I feel as if EA might skip this one. That being said, nobody is always right and if you believe this could happen, you know where to invest!
Racing vs Independiente 
Next up we have an Argentinian derby between Racing and Independiente known as the Avellaneda Derby (Clasico De Avellaneda). According to Wiki, this derby exists due to the fact that the two team's stadiums are a mere 200 meters apart, I hope at least some of these facts are true! Investing here is fairly straight forward as both teams appear to have a sufficient supply of gold cards to go around. Just ensure you are buying them at discard or at least as close as physically possible!
Motherwell vs Celtic
The final game making the list for this week's predictions is based in Scotland, and once again, is not a rivalry. Motherwell take on Celtic in this Scottish League Cup final, and based on the fact that we are yet to see this league feature within Marquee Matchups, I like including it here. The worrying aspect would be the distinct lack of cup games previously featured by EA, but with the lack of gold cards available for Motherwell, this could be an investment that sees hype do all the work for us."
Review - Prime Icon Nesta,17-Mar-18 06:38,"Alessandro Nesta, loved for his amazing defensive abilities, hated for his amazing defensive abilities. It’s not easy to play football at a top level for a decade, and this beloved Italian did it for two decades. With all he’s achieved he’s landed a 92 rated prime Icon card by EA Sports, but is he worth the price you’re asked to pay? 
I used Nesta for 15 games in Division 1 and a couple Weekend League games, during which he had the basic chemistry style. My ratings for each section are based on CB’s in the game, not every player (For example, 4/5 pace does not mean he’s as fast as Messi, but someone like Sergio Ramos) 
Here’s the team he captained:


 
PACE
Whether you’re someone who casually plays the Weekend League, dominates the Weekend League, or sticks to Divisions/Squad Battles, Nesta’s pace will meet your standard. 74 acceleration and 70 sprint speed is quality for a central defender. Let me explain. Most defenders have a higher sprint speed and lower acceleration, meaning they will get beat on a short run but can keep up in the long run. Nesta has a higher acceleration so he’s able to close down the space and make the tackle quickly, instead of having to catch up. Now while the difference between 70 and 74 is honestly quite small it feels larger in game. You notice how Nesta can switch from standing like a brick wall to giving his best Road Runner impression. I’d like to compare his pace to Sergio Ramos, as they seem very similar (and I used them alongside each other for three games), while Ramos slightly edged him out in speed, but barely. He isn’t your Ferdinand, Maldini, or TOTY Ramos, but he has the speed necessary.
Rating: 3.5/5
 

PASSING
An overlooked statistic for defenders, mostly central defenders, is passing. While they do a fantastic job of stopping an attack and taking possession, they must somehow switch from defending to attacking. The Italian Stallion has 81 short passing which is the normal passing you’d see on a forward/midfield gold card, but this is on an incredibly defensive player. For comparison, Chiellini has 59 short passing, Boateng has 75, SIF Benatia has 74, Ramos has 78. He’s in the top few that have above 80 short passing. It’s something you don’t realize was helpful until you try and send the ball up to Martial and it’s gone to the other side of the pitch, missing Alessandrini, and pelting Wenger in the face. It just adds another dimension to his card and something you never have to worry about because you’re able to count on him making the necessary pass. 
Rating: 4/5 (This is in comparison to players similar to him, so CB’s)
 

DRIBBLING
Another seemingly overlooked statistic for defenders is their dribbling. Let me set the scene for you, my reader. Your opponent has gotten a free kick from ~25 yards out and they can smell the inside of the penalty area. 8 out of 11 of his players are in your box and 10 out of your 11 are crammed next to them like sardines in a can. This congested box reeks of sweat, very very expensive cologne, and oddly enough sardines. Lionel Messi makes his short run up to the ball, which seems to take forever, and lifts the ball as if it was a balloon; bending it down as quickly as it rose. The patented NikeTM football rings off the crossbar and cascades down into the bowels of the penalty area, surrounded by still motionless AI who all spring into action at the same time. Alessandro Nesta is granted by the grace of EA to touch the ball first. 78 ball control, 89 reactions, and 78 composure all spring into action right in time and he’s able to cleanly trap the ball, and punt it right out of play 20 yards up the field. Most of the top defenders right now, Ramos, Boateng, Ferdinand, etc. all have decent enough ball control and dribbling for their positions. Nesta is up in the top few (setting aside ridiculous cards who make this card irrelevant like TOTY Ramos) that can hold their own with the ball at their feet. He does not disappoint, but does not shine either, it’s once again, adding another dimension to his card.
Let’s not forget one eye sore in the dribbling category though, the atrocious 38 agility and 52 balance. The reason this isn’t much of a talking point for me right now is because I honestly did not notice it at all. Nesta doesn’t feel very clunky or painful to move with, but rather quite decent. If I had to guess before I looked I’d have said 65-70 agility and balance. I wouldn’t worry much about this to be honest.
Rating: 3/5
 

DEFENDING
Here we’ve reached the sole purpose of this card, to defend. Nesta flashes a juicy 94 defending on his card and he does not disappoint. 95 marking, 95 standing tackle, 94 sliding tacke, 93 interceptions, and 86 heading accuracy. You cannot ask for much more. He’s not a once trick pony who has amazing standing tackling but poor interceptions, no no no. Nesta covers every single area of defending, he is the complete defender through and though. Here’s what you’ll notice in game and what he feels like. He is always, and I mean always in the right place at the right time. His 95 marking and 93 interceptions means Nesta knows exactly where to stand at all times. If you’re not manually pulling him out of position Nesta seems to shut down every looming attack. Second are his lunges. Nesta commits to all of his tackles 110%, if you press the tackle button he is throwing his whole body at the ball and either ending the attack or snapping Ronaldo’s ankle. Nine times out of ten he’s ending the attack since he has that incredible 95 standing tackle. And lastly are his interceptions, Nesta does a great job of not only being in the right place but stepping up at the perfect time to intercept a dangerous pass. Sometimes things get crazy and very touch close but somehow Nesta walks out of the pile with the ball on his feet having stolen it from someone expertly. 
Rating: 5/5
 

PHYSICAL
The second most important category on a defenders card is his physical ability. Nesta boasts 92 strength, 87 aggression, 84 jumping, and 73 stamina. This review is about being honest, and trying to give you an idea of what it’s like to use Nesta’s card in game. So with that being said I believe his strength feels lower than 92. He doesn’t seem to get very physical and at times I’ve been beat by the likes of Salah and Suarez in a shoulder-to-shoulder battle. When you supposedly have +10 strength on a player you’d think it’s a no brainer that Nesta would come out on top, yet he hasn’t. It’s not only two moments as you can count those out as flukes but I’ve noticed it occasionally throughout the fifteen games. Do not get me wrong he’s a strong player, but I feel that 88 strength sounds more appropriate for how he felt in game. His stamina is of course no issue as CB’s move a lot less and only need ~70 stamina to play 90 minutes plus a slice more. His jumping felt average at best, he’s tall enough (6”2’) so he’s not invisible in the air, but he doesn’t dominate like Vieira or Ramos would. All in all his physical was bang average in my eyes, and didn’t really impress me like his tackling and marking did. 
Rating: 3/5 (It was good, but I felt like I was lied to and a little let down)
 

MENTALITY
Last but not least, is everything else about Nesta. He has the “Power Header” trait, I can’t quite speak to this because I didn’t find him in corners all too often, but of course he has the “Tackler” specialty as well as the “Strength” specialty, both of which I had spoken about before. His work rates are perfect for a defender, Medium / High, and work wonderfully with his positioning. There isn’t a doubt in my mind that Nesta is always in the right place and if someone sneaks by him it’s my fault. 6”2’ (187cm) is a very good height for a CB, he’s not too tall so he feels clunky, but not too short that he can’t play physically/in the air. 
Rating: 3.5/5
 

CONSENSUS
Here’s my two cents on Nesta. He’s a brilliant defensive player who has some speed to him, and he has no trouble dribbling/passing. BUT there’s a catch, first off there are players who are better than him. This game caters to a specific play style and if you really want success, you roll with the Meta super team. I would not include the new prime Nesta in your team if you already have Ferdinand and/or Sergio Ramos. I think that the regular 90 Ramos is a better card, same goes with middle/prime Ferdinand, and Desailly (I haven’t tried Blanc but possibly him as well), and of course Maldini. All of these cards have something in common and that’s speed. If you want a very successful CB you want the fastest and best defensive combination and while Nesta is amazing, he isn’t AS fast as Ferdinand, Ramos, Desailly, and Maldini.

I’ll get to my second point though, and that’s something along the lines of passion. You don’t hear much about 91 Pires, but as an Arsenal fan I went ahead and did his SBC a month ago. He has over 162 goal contributions in 161 games playing LW and I haven’t thought twice about replacing him. Some players work for you while others don’t. Another example for me is Icon Schmeichel who was my best goalkeeper before the Vieira SBC came out but is largely hated by the community. If you grew up watching Nesta and he has a soft spot in your heart, and you have the coins, I encourage you to use him because he’s an amazing CB but also brings some fun back into the game getting to use a player you have idolized. 
He’s fantastic, but doesn’t fit the meta. If you want that 39/40 wins in the weekend league don’t bother, if you want a great CB then go with Ramos who’s much cheaper. But if you want a great CB, you have the coins to spare and your team is already set, enjoy Nesta before FIFA 19 comes out. 
Final Rating: 3.67/5
 
Game Stats:

 
Game Highlights:"
TOTW27 Predictions,19-Mar-18 11:26,"Starting Eleven
Fahrman 
Schalke were away to Wolfsburg for their weekend fixture and in an extremely tight game, it was the visitors who scraped ahead in a 1-0 win. Fahrmann only had 3 shots on his goal throughout the match but a couple of big saves, including one from the spot, may just be enough to see him make the cut this week.
Jefferson 
Portugal is our next destination where we find Braga away to Chaves. The game consisted of 5 goals but sadly for the hosts, only one of them went in their favor. Braga left as 4-1 victors and while Horta was fantastic, scoring twice and assisting another, he was only inform last week. Now while he could still take this award, Jefferson at left back could just steal the spot. With a fantastic display and 2 assists to his name, could this be his moment?
Donatti 
Argentina up next and Racing Club were hosts to Patronato de Parana. The home side were absolutely dominant throughout the fixture and this shows with the score ending 5-0. Three of these goals came from the two CB's and two of them from Donatti. When we couple this with his clean sheet, he is all but guaranteed a spot this week.
Albiol 
Napoli were at home to Genoa for their Serie A clash on Sunday and despite perhaps being considered strong favourites on paper, the match itself was incredibly tight. Albiol was not only solid at the back, ensuring a clean sheet was kept throughout, but he also went on to score a 72nd minute winner as well, picking Napoli up 3 points and himself the man of the match award.
Tomkins 
The relegation battle is really starting to heat up in the Premier League and with Palace away to Huddersfield, both sides were desperately in need of all the points. This time it was the visitors who were victorious with Tomkins the man of the hour. In a 2-0-win Tomkins not only provided a solid performance at the back, keeping a clean sheet, but also scored one of the goals to ensure the victory as well.
Kroos 
Over to Spain now where we find a match consisting of 9 goals between Real Madrid and Girona. Real Madrid took the points this time, however with the game finishing 6-3, it was far from a comfortable performance. Ronaldo has truly found his form again though, scoring four and assisting a fifth would normally secure his spot, however as he features in the FUTBirthday promo, he won't be featuring this time around. Kroos however had a fantastic performance as while, he may not have scored but with 2 assists and a great game from start to finish, he has definitely given himself a real chance this week.
Nainggolan 
Roma were on the road this weekend as they travelled to Crotone for their Serie A fixture. The match ended 2-0 to the visitors and while there were some fantastic performances across the entire team, a couple of players really stood out. Kolarov was solid at the back, securing a clean sheet and providing an assist, however our choice falls with Nainggolan. We all know EA love a big name, and with a goal and fantastic performance, he may have just about done enough to make the cut. If not, we could be seeing Kolarov creep in ahead.
Keita 
RasenBallsport Leipzig were hosts to league leaders Bayern for their Bundesliga clash and after Bayern's recent form, nobody would really fancy their chances against them. Leipzig however were ready and actually the dominant team throughout most of the match. Despite going 1-0 down, they fought back and the match ended 2-1 to the hosts. Keita was fundamental to this success, scoring the first and assisting the second.
Salah 
When Liverpool signed this Egyptian from Roma last year, nobody could have quite predicted the immediate impact he was going to have. Liverpool were back at home this week against the travelling Watford and during a comfortable 5-0 win for the hosts, Salah played a part in each and every goal. Scoring four, yes four and assisting the fifth, not only has he secured his place in the TOTW but he has also put himself in the running for POTM and gone further ahead in his claim for the golden boot.
Mbappe 
It's been fairly quite in recent weeks in regards to PSG. After an early exit from the Champions League, an injury to Neymar and some tougher games than expected, it’s about time we saw this youngsters name reappear in these predictions. PSG were at home to Angers on Wednesday and after getting Motta sent off fairly early into the game, they showed the strength and resilience needed to still obtain 3 points. In a 2-1 victory it was Mbappe who scored both and was only denied his hat-trick by the woodwork!
Icardi 
Over to Italy now where we find ourselves with yet another PTG card featuring in these predictions. Inter Milan were away to Sampdoria and after Perisic finally put them ahead in the 26th minute, you could tell that things weren’t going to end well for the hosts. The match ended 5-0 and although Icardi may not have scored the first goal, he ensured he finished the next four to secure his spot in this week's team.
 
Substitutes
Muslera
Fenerbahce and Galatasaray went head to head in this heated Super Lig fixture on Saturday and despite both teams giving it their all, neither could break the deadlock and the match ended 0-0. The stats were fairly even overall, but Muslera pulled off some fantastic saves to ensure that Galatasaray secured at least a point.
Ziyech 
Ajax were away to Sparta Rotterdam for their weekend fixture and in a game of 7 goals, it was the visitors who secured the points in a 5-2 victory. There were some terrific performances across the board however it’s about time Ziyech finally achieved his first inform of the year. Scoring twice from central midfield, this week just has to be his week!
Belfodil 
Over to the Bundesliga again now where Werder Bremen were away to Augsburg. In a game of four goals, it was the travelling side who took the points in a triumphant 3-1 win. Belfodil out on the wing played a part in all of the goals, scoring twice and assisting the third while achieving a perfect match rating too.
Ilicic
Atalanta were on the road this weekend as they travelled to Verona for their Serie A clash. The game itself consisted of five goals, which sadly for Verona, all went in favor of the visitors. Ilicic on the right wing was incredible, scoring twice from open play and once from the spot to complete his hat-trick, along with a perfect match rating.
Lamah 
Over to America now where we find FC Dallas playing hosts to Seattle in the MLS. It was all one-way traffic on the day as Dallas went on to win 3-0. Lamah was the star of the show, scoring twice and assisting the third, he played a part in each and every goal.
Mario Gomez 
Stuttgart were away to Freiburg for their Bundesliga clash on the weekend and once again we see a PTG player leap into action. In a narrow 2-1 win for the visitors it was once again Gomez who provided both the goals in an absolutely fantastic performance throughout. The only worry with this one is that he was inform just the other week, is it too soon for a second inform?
Tosun 
This week saw a distinct lack of games across the Premier League due to the FA Cup, but this had no effect on the Merseyside teams who both managed to pick up all 3 points. Everton stole a last-minute winner away to Stoke and in a 2-1 win, Tosun was the man who provided both goals. If Tosun were to make the cut, people should remember that he always has a TOTGS card from his time at Besiktas, so we would be seeing a double jump in rating here!
Ilyin 
Over to Russia for this selection where Ural were away to SKA-Khabarovsk. The match ended 3-0 to the visitors with Ilyin providing one hell of a performance. Not only was he involved in each and every goal, scoring twice and assisting the third, but his perfect match rating on top of this should be enough to ensure he makes the cut.
Martinez 
With the MLS season back into full swing now, we see Atlanta United playing hosts to Vancouver in a game of five goals. Sadly, the journey was far from worth it for the visitors as Atlanta went on to win the match 4-1. Martinez was the man of the hour, scoring twice from open play and once from the spot to not only secure his hat-trick, but hopefully his second inform too!
Hinterseer 
We head over to the second German division now where Bochum were away to Sandhausen in a five-goal thriller. It was the visitors who left with smiles across their faces, edging out a narrow 3-2 victory. Hinterseer was in absolutely incredible form, scoring not once, not twice, but three goals to secure his hat-trick along with all the points for his side.
Kvilitaia
In the Austrian League, Rapid Wien played hosts to Wolfsberger AC and in a 6-goal game, it was the hosts who took the points as comfortable 5-1 winners. Kvilitaia was the man of the match this time, bagging himself 2 goals from open play and one from the spot to secure his hat-trick.
Unal 
Villarreal played hosts to Atletico Madrid for their La Liga clash on Sunday and after giving away an early penalty, things were looking pretty bleak for the hosts. It wasn't until the 74th minute that Unal was brought onto the pitch and this guy was the pure definition of an impact sub. Scoring twice in the final 15 minutes, to turn what looked like a loss into a win.

Review - EoaE Kaká,21-Mar-18 06:36,"Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite, also known as Kaká, is one of football’s greatest players and his career is coming to an end. Despite that he has an 80 rated overall card at age 35, and earned himself this 92 rated ‘End of an Era’ card that’s meant to look back at one of the greatest moments in his career. It’s incredibly cheap for a 92 rated card, but has some downsides. 
This review is based on 10 games played with this card on a basic chemistry style, in Division 1 and Friendly games (For the Irish requirements). This was the team that Kaká featured in:

 
PACE
One of the things about Kaká is that he’s a tall player, 6 foot 1, so half a Mertesacker. 86 acceleration, and 83 sprint speed. As a tall player, it’s unique to be able to accelerate quickly, and very few players have that. Kaká is tall and speeds up quickly, meaning he almost gives a sort of Patrick Vieira speed where he’s this full on sprinting bear down the pitch. And if you thought you were quick, you haven’t seen a sprinting bear. And I completely mean this; it’s honestly how he feels when you hold down L2, and very much like Patrick Vieira but three pace faster. And let me quickly justify my rating below, he isn’t blistering fast, but it’s such a nice feel for his card. A tall, strong, and decently quick player is something I honestly think is better than small/weak and 90+ pace.
RATING: 4/5
 
SHOOTING
I don’t really know what to say, 92 positioning, 88 finishing, 91 shot power and long shots, 99 volleys and penalties. This is all before a chemistry style is added. This isn’t even a striker card. He’s in the right place, puts away 88% of his shots, they’re powerful, and distance isn’t a factor. It doesn’t even matter if it’s on the ground or in the air. You don’t get a much better spread of amazing stats, it’s similar to Aguero, but so much even better. I’ll speak on what I noticed the most of all here, and that was shot power beyond a reasonable doubt. His shots are so ridiculously powerful I think they break the speed of sound, and it shocks the goalkeeper, who then stands no chance. Next I noticed his long shots mostly because I’ve struck the bar so many times and the ball would ricochet off into space. His shots are so precise and powerful from distance that he’s as lethal from 30 yards as he is from 5. I like to use a card before I apply a chemistry style so I can feel out what’s strong and what areas are lacking. For Kaká I won’t think twice about boosting his shooting as there is seriously no need. Sadly one thing I noticed was that his left-footed shots seemed oddly not very powerful, I couldn’t tell if that was just an off moment or not but I felt it was worth noting.
RATING: 4.5/5
 
PASSING
Likely my third favorite category about this card is his passing. As a CAM your role is to contribute to the attack in every way possible, passing, dribbling, and shooting. Kaká has provided so many key passes in games and you notice! They’re those passes that you don’t think will go through but somehow snake their way onto your skippers boot. While he didn’t get me that many assists I loved it when he had the ball on his feet, because I knew he was able to instantly make a very very accurate pass, even if he was upside down and balancing a cup of tea I could count on him to keep the attack alive. 91 short passing, 94 vision, and 94 curve all come together to produce some more magic from the Brazilian legend.
RATING: 4/5
 
DRIBBLING
Kaká is one of those players that you can’t really describe how they feel because he’s so incredibly unique. Let me try the Frankenstein method, if you put together Prime Robert Pires, a sprinkle of Ronaldo, a little chunk of Patrick Vieira, a slice of Birthday Yaya Toure, and a sliver of Thierry Henry, you get Kaká. He is such an incredible player to dribble with, it’s astonishing what he’s able to do. Honestly I think the game is bugged and when you pass it to Kaká it’s stuck inside his foot, because he keeps it so fascinatingly close. It’s better than Hazard, than Messi, and better than Okocha. It’s easily the best feature of this already great card. Precision dribbling is your friend here. 
RATING: 5/5
 
DEFENDING
Honestly atrocious, you actually notice how bad it is. When you use someone like Messi you notice all the great he does, but don’t really notice how poor his defending is. Kaká blatantly misses easy tackles by full on lunging the wrong way like a seal, his ‘dive’ is so poor I can’t call it a dive but more of a flop, and he will watch a ball straight up roll through his legs and not even try to grab it. Keep him so far in the attack he cannot get a single attempt to make a tackle because it’s a waste of pixel space unless he’s passed the ball. 
RATING: 1/5
 
PHYSICAL
This section has a lot of love and a lot of hate. Let me start with the very clear 55 stamina and clear up the elephant in the room, oh no wait that’s just Higuain. It’s bad, and he gets tired very quickly. By the 65th minute he’s clearly dragging his feet and he feels like a shadow of the former first half man. It’s like after the 65th EA turn the card into his 80 rated one. That being said, I confidently use him through 90 minutes, and twice through 120 minutes. At the 75th he should be substituted off, but through the whole 120 he can still shoot very well. So if you play him as a CAM, not a CF or ST after the 75th minute you can still get a great deal out of him, but tread carefully. 
Kaká stamina after 90 mins:


Now onto my next favorite part of this card, his strength. 88 strength on a fast player who can dribble incredibly well and pick out the top corners of the net. This is what gives him the Patrick Vieira feel, the brute strength. Kaká is so strong, he shrugs people off easily and the ball never even leaves his foot. If he didn’t have that 88 strength this card would be mediocre at best, but this makes him excel and such a threat everywhere on the green. This alone makes up for the lack of stamina. 
RATING: 2.5/5 (Stamina makes it a ‘1/5’ and strength makes it a ‘5/5’)
 
MENTALITY
So not only does Kaká have passing, shooting, dribbling, pace, and strength, but four star skill moves and four star weak foot? The farther down I read the wider my smile gets. He can confidently use both feet and has all the necessary skills to cross defenders eyes. Yes, yes, and yes. He has the finesse shot, flair, and playmaker trait, to add onto his already drool inducing card. On top of that he has High/Medium work rates so he’s always sitting in that perfect pocket ready to move up and attack. Everything here is great, and in no small way disappointing.
RATING: 5/5
 
CONSENSUS
We’ve reached the end of the case, and the jurors have spoken (me). I love 99% of this card so god damn much. He’s so quick and strong, but he can still dribble like an absolute god. Then once you’ve stormed and pushed through the defense you can curl, power, or chip De Gea and make it look easy and smooth. There are two things I do not like, and that is his defending and stamina. His defending is seriously horrific, and stamina is a problem. But not enough for me to say that I don’t think he’s a good card, he’s ready for the Weekend League, maybe even pro players teams (I’d imagine their benches). What I recommend is playing Kaká as a CAM or CF for the most part, but be ready to sub him on/off. He’s either coming on at half time or leaving in the 75th, likely for Lozano. That is how you can get the best of this card without having to worry about the downsides. As a striker I feel like he could play longer, but I think his passing isn’t used enough if he’s solely upfront and not pulling the strings of the attack like he can do so well. When it comes to his price? I think it’s a no-brainer, this card to me is worth well over 300K and I’d consider buying him before many other cards around 500K. At the moment he’s 100K and an absolute steal. If you want a great player to bring on at half time, or even a starting attacking midfielder, I’d think you shouldn’t hesitate to complete the Kaká SBC especially at the price he’s at!
RATING: 3.7/5

Game Highlights:"
LaLiga Santander TOTS Predictions,04-May-18 08:33,"Starting Eleven
Ter Stegen 
First up we have Barcelona’s goalkeeper and if your not a Barcelona fan, look away now, as they make up the majority of these predictions. Barcelona have had a fantastic season so far, and with just 4 games left, the league is theirs to lose. Ter Stegen has been a formidable force in goal, averaging 2.5 saves a match and having only conceded 21 goals this season.
Roberto 
As we mentioned above, this line-up is Barcelona heavy, so heavy that they make up the entire defensive starting eleven. Roberto at right-back is first up and while we have already mentioned just how incredible Barcelona have been at the back, this man adds that flair going forward as well. With a goal and 6 assists to his name, he shows that he is the complete package.
Umtiti 
It may have taken Umtiti a few months to settle in after joining last year, but it looks like he has found his feet this season, and has been an absolute rock at the back throughout. Now Umtiti may not have any fancy stats, goals scored, assists or informs, but he is a perfect example of consistency and is one of the reasons that Barcelona have only conceded 21 in the league so far.
Pique 
Next up we have Pique, a man who has been at the club for years and a natural leader. We have a very similar situation to that of Umtiti’s here, nothing too fancy, but he provides reliability and consistency each and every game. Pique has also shown that he can provide that threat going forward as well, with 2 goals to his name in the league so far. We have to remember he has already featured in the community TOTS, but as we have seen in the past, that doesn’t stop him appearing in these too!
Alba 
We round up our starting eleven’s back line with yet another Barcelona player. Jordi Alba takes this spot and to anyone who may argue that he is undeserving, you are simply wrong. We have spoken about Barcelona’s defensive record too many times already, but let’s have a look at what Alba can offer going forward. With 8 assists and 2 goals, Alba has played a part in roughly 12% of Barcelona’s goals this year and from a left-back, this is impressive to say the least.
Busquets
Moving up the pitch now and just when you thought we may have finally escaped Barcelona for a while, we drag you back in with yet another selection. In my opinion, Busquets is probably one of the most under-rated players in the world. Yes, we all know he is a top tier player, but does he ever really get the credit he deserves? This man is the glue that holds the entire team together, solid defensively, perfect vision when creating attacks and he even has a goal and 3 assists to his name. Leaving Busquets out would be an absolute disgrace.
Kroos
Finally we manage to crawl away from Barcelona nominations, although enjoy this moment as it won’t last for long! Real Madrid have had a difficult season, they currently sit fourth in the league and outside of automatic Champions League qualification. Their defence has been shaky at best, conceding more than double the amount of goals when compared to Barcelona or Atlético. Kroos however has been a shining light during this difficult period, providing solid performances throughout, while scoring 4 and assisting another 6.
Ronaldo 
Could you even imagine a set of nominations that didn’t include this man? While Madrid have been struggling and even Ronaldo has far from an easy start to the season, you can always count on him to turn things around and come or on top. Out of Madrid’s 82 goals this season, Ronaldo has played a part in 29 of them. With 24 goals, 5 assists and therefore playing a direct part in 36% of the goals, he is still the same superstar we all know and love.
Messi 
After reading Ronaldo’s stats and contribution rates, it becomes difficult to even imagine a player who has had a stronger season. Messi however has been absolutely sensational, and must be a strong front runner for the Balon D’or. Barcelona have scored 87 in the league so far and Messi has been directly involved in over 50% of the goals! With 32 scored and 12 assists, he cements his spot as one of the greatest and when we consider he has secured 21 man of the match awards from the 33 games played, it just takes your breath away.
Suarez
As far as Suarez is concerned, he has been fairly quiet this year compared to previous form. The key thing to remember here however, is that fairly quiet for Suarez, is still incredible when compared to anyone else. With a total of 23 goals and 9 assists, Suarez is behind both Messi and Ronaldo in the race for the golden boot, however, he is right on track to earn himself a fancy, blue, team of the season card.
Griezmann
Onto our final section for this La Liga starting eleven, and finally, we find a player outside of Real Madrid and Barcelona. Atlético Madrid have had a strong season so far, they currently sit second in the league and while catching Barcelona may be unrealistic, finishing above local rivals Real Madrid is a real possibility. With a total of 55 goals scored this season, Griezmann has played a part in 27 of them. Scoring 19, assisting 8 and also picking up 8 man of the match awards, this guy is once again nailed on for his spot.
 
Substitutes
Oblak
Onto the substitutes and reserves now, and our first selection is one that has already featured in the community TOTS. Oblak has been one of the worlds best goalkeepers for several years now, and this year is no exception. Atlético have the best defensive record in the league, with just 18 goals conceded, and Oblak with his 2.8 saves a game, has been instrumental in this success.
Nacho
To say that Real Madrid have had a successful season, would be a stretch at best. They currently sit 15 points behind league leaders and bitter rivals, Barcelona, however they are in the final of the Champions League. Nacho however has been a shining light in an otherwise troubled back-line. His ability to play across several positions and his the work ethic shown, are but a couple of reasons why he makes these predictions.
Gaya 
With just 36 goals conceded this season, it’s no surprise that Valencia sit fourth in the league and Gaya, their right-back, has been an instrumental part of this success. Having played almost every game this season, he shows just how hard he works and his ability to push forward, while also remaining solid defensively, simply cannot be overlooked.
Lucas Hernandez 
With Atletico Madrid currently sitting in second place, it’s no surprise that they have the best defensive record in the league. With just 18 goals conceded all season, it would be nothing short of a crime to not recognise these achievements. First up we have Lucas Hernandez, a centre-back with no limitations at the heart of the defence.
Felipe Luis
Onto our second Atletico defender now, and while Felipe Luis has been incredible when playing, his lack of game time this year would be my only concern. Personally I believe either Luis or Vrasaljko will make the cut, however for me, Luis just edges out the win here.
Parejo 
With Valencia sitting in fourth and with a serious chance of Champions League football next year, we have to expect a couple of their players make this line-up. Parejo has been nothing short of incredible this year, solid across the midfield, brilliant defensively and has even shown his ability going forward with 7 goals, 7 assists and 7 man of the match awards too.
Kondogbia 
Onwards and upwards with these predictions now, and we see yet another Valencia player featuring in these predictions. Kondogbia has been incredibly solid as a holding midfield across the season, fantastic defensively, but has also shown his ability going forward with 4 goals and 4 assists as well.
Saul
While they may be out of the Champions League and not top of La Liga, anybody suggesting Atlético haven’t had a strong season would be incredibly misinformed. With a second leg tie this evening against Arsenal in the Europa league and their current position of second in La Liga, it’s clear that Atlético are improving year on year. Saul once again has been a critical part of the team, solid across the midfield, endless stamina and even 2 goals and 3 assists to his name.
Guedes
Back across to Valencia now and while Guedes may not have had the game-time he needed while at PSG, Valencia have ensured they utilise this youngsters abilities. With 4 goals and 9 assists in the league so far, Guedes has been a critical part of Valencia’s success, and at the young age of just 21, we could be looking at a future star.
Rodrigo 
Moving onto Valencia’s attack now, and while many would have a different selection here, personally I feel like Rodrigo has done enough. From the 62 goals scored by Valencia in the league, Rodrigo has been a part of 20. Having provided 4 assists and 16 goals, Rodrigo secures his spot in our La Liga predictions.
Aspas 
This man pops up time after time, whether it’s an Inform, a man of the match or even a team of the season, year after year you can guarantee that he will preform. While Celta Vigo may sit in the bottom have of the table, Aspas has once again been a diamond in the rough. From the 54 goals scored, Aspas has been a part of almost half. With 20 goals, 5 assists and 10, yes 10 man of the match awards, his team of the season card is all but confirmed.
Stuani
Back to Girona for our final selection, where we find Stuani, who has been lethal in front of Goal this year. From the 47 goals Girona have scored, Stuani has been a part of 19. Now while he may not have any assists, 19 goals and 2 man of the match awards show just how dangerous this Uruguayan is, and surely he has done enough to make this final selection.

TOTW19 Predictions,22-Jan-18 15:46,"Starting Eleven
Alisson 
Roma were away to Inter Milan for their Sunday fixture and with Roma having just the one shot on target, they were extremely fortunate to come away with a 1-1 draw. Alisson in goal was the hero of the day, pulling off a total of 7 incredible saves to ensure they at least left with a point.
Thomas 
Angers were hosts to Troyes for their Ligue 1 match, and while the hosts managed to secure a 3-1 victory, it wasn't their strikers who were finding the net. From the CB role, Thomas not only put in a solid performance defensively, but also found the back of the net twice.
Nacho 
Real Madrid were hosts to Deportivo in La Liga and with Champions League spots tighter than ever, they really needed to find some form. In a game of 8 goals, it was all one-way traffic, with the hosts comfortably winning 7-1. While both Bale and Ronaldo scored twice, it's their CB Nacho who gets the nod with two goals to his name as well.
Monreal 
A struggling Arsenal were hosts to Crystal Palace on the weekend, and with both Ozil and Sanchez missing things were looking pretty bleak. Within the first 25 minutes however Arsenal had managed to take a 4-0 lead, with Monreal not only scoring once but assisting another two. The match ended 4-1, and which should be enough to secure him a spot this week.
Savic 
Lazio were hosts to Chievo for their Serie A fixture, and in a game of 6 goals, there was only ever one winner. In a 5-1 victory it was their CM, Savic, who really stole the show. With 2 goals and a dominating performance across the pitch, could he be due a second inform this week?
Fekir 
Ligue 1 had two fixture this week and after Lyons first 2-0 win, Fekir was already in these predictions with a goal and a fantastic performance. On Sunday, Lyon hosted league leaders PSG where against all odds they provided a 2-1 victory for their fans. Once again, Fekir was the man of the hour, scoring once and assisting the second.
Rakitic 
Barcelona were on the road to Real Betis for their Sunday fixture where they left as comfortable 5-0 winners. Suarez bagged 2 goals and 2 assists, Messi had 2 goals and an assist, but sadly neither are eligible for this TOTW and hence our attention is turned to the next standout performance. Rakatic not only scored, but assisted another, leaving him as our selection from Barcelona this week.
Muller 
Bayern were at home to Werder Bremen for their Bundesliga clash, and in a 6-goal thriller, it was the hosts who took all the points. Lewandowski found the back of the net twice, but the real standout performance was from Muller with 2 goals and an assist to his name.
Neymar 
There really isn't much that needs to be said here, so I will simply summarize. PSG 8-0 Dijon, Neymar 4 goals and 2 assists. It's happening, nothing else needs to be said.
Hazard 
Chelsea were on the road to Brighton for their Premier League fixture and in a dominating display, they left as 4-0 winners. Despite some fantastic performances across the pitch, once again it was Hazard who really stole the show. Scoring twice and receiving a perfect match rating, surely this is enough to see him bag his third inform of the year?
Aguero 
With Gabriel Jesus still out injured and Manchester City having just faced their first loss of the season, the pressure was on to instantly regain their form. This is exactly what they did, and it was the experienced Aguero who ensured this happened. Aguero not only scored the first, but also the second and third to ensure a City win, a hat-trick and his third inform of the year.
 
Substitutes
Juan Carlos 
CD Lugo were at home to Sporting de Gijon for their weekend fixture in the second Spanish division. With the game fairly tight at 2-1, the ball falls into CD Lugo's half, with their keeper, Carlos, heading towards it. A single strike sees the ball loop over a struggling keeper into the net, yes ladies and gentleman Carlos scored from within his own half. If a goalkeeper 60-yard goal isn't enough, then nothing should be!
Ginter 
Borussia M'Gladbach were hosts to Augsburg for their Bundesliga fixture and in a game of 2 goals, both went in favour of the home side. Ginter at the back not only ensured a clean sheet was kept, but he also scored once and assisted the second. Could this be time for his third inform already?
Lala 
Strasbourg were hosts to Dijon for their weekend match where in an incredibly tight match, they just managed to edge out the opposition in a 3-2 win. Their RB Lala is the selection this week, scoring twice from the spot to ensure all the points stayed where they were.
Ribeiro 
Rio Ave were at home to Boavista and in a game of few goals, they left as 2-0 victors. Ribeiro at LB was the man of the whole, not only did he control the backline and ensure a clean sheet, but he also found the net once himself.
Thorgan Hazard 
With his brother already in these predictions, it only seems fair that we include Thorgan as well! Borussia M'Gladbach were 2-0 winners over Augsburg on the weekend, and while we already have Ginter as a nominee, Thorgan played exceptionally well and also deserves a mention. With a goal and an assist in an almost flawless display, will we see both the Hazard's getting informs this week?
Bailey 
Leverkusen were on the road to Hoffenheim for their Bundesliga clash and with a comfortable 4-1 victory the journey was well worth it. While there were several stand out performances, Bailey was the man of the hour. Scoring once and assisting another, while easily taking the MOTM award, will we see him feature again this week?
Verdi 
Bologna were hosts to Benevento this week and despite the travelling sides recent form, Bologna were simply too much for them. Picking up an easy 3-0 win, it was Verdi who really stood out, providing the assist for each and every goal.
Kessie 
AC Milan were on the road this weekend to Cagliari, and with Bonucci featuring in the TOTY, surely there was going to be nothing but confidence at the back! That may not have been the case, as AC Milan edged out a 2-1 victory, however Kessie was the man behind both goals and we could finally be seeing his OTW get a boost!
Terodde 
FC Cologne were away to Hamburg for their Bundesliga clash, and in a comfortable 2-0 victory it was Terodde who found the net twice to secure all 3 points.
Jonas 
Over to Portugal now where Benfica played hosts to Chaves in their Liga Nos fixture. Jonas has been fairly quiet this year, with just the one inform to his name people were starting to worry about him. Fear not though, with two goals this week, there is a strong chance he picks up yet another inform here!
Balotelli 
Monaco and Nice went head to head last Tuesday and with 2 goals apiece, there was no separating the two sides. While his performances this year don’t quite match that of the previous, Balotelli proved he is not done yet, scoring twice to ensure his team took at least a point.
Fonte 
Fulham seem to be scoring for fun these days and nothing was going to change when they played hosts to Burton for their weekend fixtures. In a 6-0 thrashing, it was both Fonte and Sessegnon who stole the show. With Sessegnon featuring so recently however, the nominee goes to their striker Fonte this week."
Serie A TOTS Predictions,19-May-18 09:25,"Starting Eleven
Handanovic
Our first selection for Serie A, is one that may raise a few discussions. Handanovic has had yet another solid season for Inter, and single handedly won them points along the way. The key concern is Buffon, despite his lack of game time, he has still been consistent and with it being his final season, we may see him creep in above Handanovic here.
Kolarov 
Onto our first defender now, and what a sensational season Kolarov has had. Moving to a new League is always a risk, however he has proven that age and experience trumps everything, as he contributed to a semi-final Champions League run and solid league finish. Roma only conceded 28 goals all season, and while this stat is impressive enough alone, the 2 goals, 8 assists and 6 man of the match awards secures his spot in our lineup.
Chiellini 
The title race this year was incredibly tight, but a few moments of weakness towards the end from Napoli, saw Juventus wrap things up with a game to spare. While their goal scoring record was sensational at 84, their defensive one was equally as impressive, with just 23 against them. Chiellini has already featured in the community vote, but I fully expect to see him here as well.
Benatia 
Next up we move across to Chiellini’s defensive partner, Benatia. Together they have been one hell of a force, and after such a successful campaign, I wouldn’t be surprised if both made the final cut. On top of the solid defensive showing, Benatia also has a couple of goals to his name and proves his danger from set pieces.
Sandro 
Picking fullbacks was extremely tough this time around, and while many may say Sandro fell below expectations, when we look at the success Juventus achieved and Sandro’s attacking stats, I feel like EA will make this happen. We have mentioned the defensive stats, but with 4 goals, 4 assists and 3 man of the match awards, Sandro shows that he is the complete package.
Pjanic
It’s starting to feel like we are simply listing the entire Juventus lineup here, but fear not, other teams will feature....at some point. Now while Pjanic may not have incredible numbers in regards to goals and assists, time after time he has proven just how valuable he is to Juventus, and was a fundamental part of their title push. Defensively great and with 4 goals and 8 assists, he makes it into these predictions.
Dybala 
Ok, this is the final Juventus player to feature within the starting eleven, I promise! Truth be told though, if we had to end on a Juventus player, there hasn’t been one with a more successful season. Dybala continues to prove his ability, improving game on game, year after year. Prolific across several positions, he showed how adapt he was as a centre forward, striker, left winger and right winger too. With 22 goals, 5 assists and 8 man of the match awards, this man is nailed on.
Perisic 
Over to Inter Milan now, and while they currently sit just outside of the Champions League spots, with one game to go, they could still sneak in. A few players have really stood out for Inter this year, Perisic being one of them. Having contributed to around a third of the goals, with 11 goals and 9 assists, surely he makes the final line-up.
Insigne 
Finally! It may have taken 8 Players, but we finally reach someone from Napoli. What a season they have had, pushing Juventus every step of the way and coming so close to stealing the title from them. Insigne was a fundamental part of this success, showing his ability to disturb an oppositions defensive structure and with 8 goals, 9 assists and 6 man of the match awards, this guy feels like a lock.
Icardi 
Game after game, week after week, year after year, we talk about Icardi and how he is constantly improving. This year has been no exception, and out of Inter Milan’s 69 goals, he has scored 28 of them. Despite his success, he currently sits one goal behind, in the race for the golden boot, but with 1 game remaining, anything could happen!
Immobile
So here we are, the final selection for this starting eleven, and with it, we find the current top scorer in the league. Immobile has been absolutely sensational this season, scoring 29, assisting a further 9 and wrapping up 7 man of the match awards along the way. The final match of the season is a big one, with the team needing the points and Immobile wanting to secure the golden boot.
 
Substitutes
Alisson 
Onto the bench now, and our first selection is a familiar face. It comes as no surprise that this Brazilian goalkeeper is attracting attention from across the world. Fantastic for Roma, currently keeping Ederson out the Brazilian National Team, and having already featured in the community team of the season, I fully expect to see him again here.
Skriniar 
Now with Inter Milan currently sitting in fifth, outside Champions League spots and needing a slip up from Lazio to change their fortunes, it may feel strange to see so many of their players featuring within these predictions. However, with just 28 goals conceded , it shows just how solid they have been across the back. Skriniar has played a key part in this, and with 4 goals to his name as well, he shows his importance across the entire pitch.
Koulibaly 
Onto our final defensive selection now, where we find a man who has (mostly), been absolutely brilliant for Napoli this season. With just 28 goals conceded, Napoli have the joint second best record in the league, and when we then consider the 5 goals, 1 assist and 4 man of the match awards, Koulibaly suddenly becomes a very strong candidate here.
Allan
From a critical part of Napoli’s back line, straight into the heart of their midfield now. Allan has had an incredible season for Napoli, and while there are several players with similar stats that could take this spot, Allan is our man of choice. Covering crazy amounts of the pitch each game, solid defensively, and with 4 goals and 5 assists, Allan makes our list.
Nainggolan 
From a slightly controversial selection, to one that could be considered just plain wrong. Now was Nainggolan one of the best midfielders across the season? No. Well was he particularly impressive, and consistent? Well not really. So why are we including him here? Well, the reality is that he was “good enough”, and based on previous team of the season line-ups, it appears that EA would rather include fan favourites / pack sellers, opposed to top performers.
Savic 
Wow. Words can not explain just how incredible this man has been, both in real life and for FUT players worldwide. An absolute animal on the pitch, both defensively and going forward. It’s no wonder that he is in high demand from clubs across the world, but for now, we should be guaranteed one final blue card, that features Savic in a Lazio kit.
Luis Alberto 
From one Lazio midfielder to another now, and while Alberto may commonly be regarded as a striker, he has shown his versatility this year in roles across the pitch. From Lazio’s 87 goals scored, Alberto has played a role in 25 of them. With 11 goals, 14 assists and 5 man of the match awards, this man deserves his team of the season boost.
Falque 
We haven’t really seen many players outside the top 5 clubs featuring so far, but one man that I believe truly deserves a spot, is Falque. Torino currently sit mid-table, and out of their 52 goals scored, Falque has played a part in around 30%. With 11 goals and 8 assists, I fully expect this man to feature, especially with the lack of wingers from elsewhere.
Costa 
This troubled winger has had a rough couple of years, for one reason or another, his time at other clubs have been far from successful, however Juventus have ensured they brought about change. With 17 starts and 13 appearances from the bench, Costa has been a critical part of this title win. With 4 goals, 12 assists and an above average match rating, we could be seeing Costa in blue!
Dzeko 
Onto our final three selections now, and with it we find three absolutely incredible strikers. First up is a man who has shown his worth across all competitions this season. With a solid Serie A campaign seeing Roma sit in third and an incredible Champions League run, seeing Roma reach the semi-finals, Dzeko has been incredible throughout. With 16 goals and 4 assists in the league, the raw numbers may not be as impressive as usual, however with the system EA use, it is most likely he has done enough.
Higuain 
Since his big money move a few years back, Higuain has been absolutely sensational for Juventus. The same could be said about his performances this year, even though he hasn’t been quite as clinical in front of goal. With 16 goals and 5 assists, it is likely he has done enough, and although I may be one of a select few, this is probably the team of the season card I want the most!
Mertens 
Our final selection here goes to this Belgium striker, the man who lead the line for Napoli during their title push this season. Mertens has been absolutely phenomenal since converting to a striker, and with 18 goals, 6 assists and 7 man of the match awards this season, this incredible form continues. Although Napoli can no longer win the league, surely a blue card on FUT for Mertens is the next best thing!

Marquee Matchup Predictions - Week Two,01-Oct-17 16:27,"This week we see a break from the typical domestic matches and in their place, we are greeted with a bunch of FIFA World Cup qualifying games. Finding derbies or even standout matches amongst these can be difficult, so here we are attempting to find the most important games, in terms of the points available when other options aren’t available. Keep in mind that there are domestic games taking place across the lower divisions and smaller leagues, however last year it became routine for EA to bundle international games together, which is the pattern we will follow within these suggestions.
Prior to investing, ensure you do your own research, believe in the investment and are prepared for it to backfire. It is also important we consider formations, number of cards required, rarity of cards, team rating and chemistry when picking up players.
Remember, these are only possible outcomes and may not include every possibility. Only ever make investments if you personally believe them to be solid.
 
Cyprus vs Greece
The first game on our shortlist sees two neighbouring countries go head to head. The lack of players available for Cyprus on the FIFA market suggests that if included, requirements would remain modest. While Greece has plenty of players across the board, Cyprus has no gold players available, hence the safest investment here would be discard silver players, followed closely by discard bronzes.
 
Ukraine vs Croatia
Next up we have a big match in a tightly contested group. With Ukraine, currently 4th in the table, a win at home to Croatia would see the two teams switch places, rekindling Ukraine’s hopes of qualification. On the other hand, a win for Croatia would cement their position at the top of the table, all but ensuring qualification for themselves. While they may not be the biggest footballing nations, luckily, we are still spoilt for choice when it comes to cards available within FIFA.
 
Wales vs Republic of Ireland
This match has it all! The Republic of Ireland were previously part of the UK, alongside Wales, Scotland and England, which instantly adds fuel to this fire. However, this match does more than simply dig through history, with just a point separating the two teams and a qualification spot up for grabs, this match could dictate who finishes second and who is left fighting for scraps. With the inclusion of most English leagues on FIFA, there are plenty of players from both nationalities. If you are after the gold players though, think fast as there are only a handful available.
 
Netherlands vs Sweden
This is probably one of the largest matches taking place over the next week in terms of the quality on show, and we all know how EA love to simply include a couple of big name teams. You may think that this is the sole reason for inclusion, however there is much more at stake. Three points currently separate the two teams, with Sweden being the ones ahead. A victory here and a 4 or more-goal swing, will see Netherlands overtake Sweden and hold that crucial qualification spot. As for investments, we obviously have more than enough to go around so take your time on this one!
 
Portugal vs Switzerland
Not a lot at stake in this game with both teams already having comfortably qualified. What we do have though is a winner takes all match with Switzerland currently leading the group by 3 points. If Portugal can pull off a win by 3 goals or more, they will steal that all important top spot. Just like before, investments here are plentiful and there is more than enough to go around.
 
Brazil vs Chile
Finally, we have a match from the South America, and it’s a big one. Brazil currently lead the group by a comfortable 10-point margin, and while that can’t be changed Chile sit in 6th place with a small mountain to climb. Ignoring Brazil, 4 points is all that separates second and sixth place in this group, nothing is set in stone yet. A win against Ecuador on Friday could revitalise the team, leaving them with everything to gain in the final match against Brazil. For the final time today as well, availability of cards on the market should be more than sufficient for the early investors."
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,17-Feb-18 15:18,"Manchester United vs Chelsea 
After a week-long break we see the return of the Premier League and it returns with a bang. Manchester United play hosts to Chelsea and with positions for Champions League becoming tighter and tighter, a win here is critical for both sides. Just like the Juventus match last week, we see potential for investments, especially if the requirements are 2 from each side. Picking up gold players for discard is our ideal investment this time and should be easily achievable, especially with all of the Lunar festivities.
 
Cardiff vs Bristol Cit 
Staying in England for our second selection where we head down south to find local rivals Cardiff and Bristol City go head to head. This fixture goes by the name of the ""Severnside Derby"" and while on this occasion it features Bristol City and Cardiff, games under this bracket also include; Bristol Rovers vs Cardiff and either Bristol side vs Newport County. Investments here are spread across the board as while gold players are obtainable, they are fairly rare and hence turning our attention to silver or even bronze players if required isn't an awful decision. Keep in mind that we saw a Championship game feature this week, so hype selling may be the correct choice once more.
 
PSG vs Marseille 
Over to France for this pick where we see league leaders PSG playing host to Marseille in a fixture known as ""Le Classique"". Apparently, this match is classed as France's biggest footballing rivalry that carries more rivalry aspects than you could imagine. It features the two largest cities in France, Paris and Marseille, the capital against province and north against south. Investments here are once again nice and simple, we are spoilt for choice with gold players but take into account this week's Juventus game when investing, one team rose massively due to supply, the other not quite so much.
 
Lyon vs ASSE 
We are staying in France for this selection and instead of offering another prediction, we are offering an alternative to the one above. Lyon vs ASSE is known as the ""Derby Rhone-Alpes"", ""Derby Rhonealpin"" or even simply ""Le Derby"" and is a rivalry that dates many years back. Like mentioned before, if we see a game from Ligue 1 featuring, it will either be the above game or this one, so don't expect to see both pop up! Investments here are fairly straight forward once more, just get in as early as possible and pay as close to discard as you can!
 
Besiktas vs Fenerbahce 
Moving across to Turkey for this selection where Besiktas play hosts to Fenerbahce towards the top of the table. With just four points separating first and fourth, there is still everything to play for this season and a win here for either side would really put them in touching distance of that coveted number one spot. Investing here is straight forward once again, plenty of gold players available and they can all be obtained for discard as long as you are sniping, bidding and smart.
 
Grasshopper Club Zurich vs FC Zurich 
Switzerland is our next destination where we find Grasshopper Club Zurich and FC Zurich going head to head in a match known only as the ""Zurich Derby"". The two sides were founded in 1886 and 1896 respectively, with Grasshopper being known as the club of the elite while Zurich are known as one for the workers. The derby carries its importance as it is the only one in Switzerland that contains two teams from the same city. As for investing, get in early and aim for the highest quality of player you can, for the lowest possible price!
 
Roma vs AC Milan 
For our final selection we head over to Italy, and while this is a huge game between two massive clubs, I fear that we may see it left out simply because we saw the Serie A feature in marquee matchups this week. Investing in a match such as this should carry minimal risk due to the gold players being readily available for discard, however if this one shows up I would be surprised to say the least."
Prime Icon Maradona Is Here!,08-Mar-18 12:09,"Hello comrades, and welcome to FUT FM 41!
We now live in a Prime Icon Maradona world, and wow, he’s definitely one of those FUT cards that makes a huge impact on the entire game.
We share our full thoughts on Maradona below, plus our refreshed take on the mystery of FIFA goalkeepers, low pressure defending in Weekend League, and more! Let’s jump in.
 

 
Is 97 Prime Icon Maradona Really Worth It?

The three of us rarely agree on anything FIFA 18 related.
Our styles, and each one of us has very different thoughts about where the game should go in the future.

 
Enter Maradona, a football god. A card with almost no weakness. A card you can unironically call a game changer.
We each used Maradona on loan, and he was dominant for all.
His shooting is absolutely mad and he can score finesse shots from super long range. His passing and dribbling are excellent, and his attacking positioning always ensures that the Argentine icon is in the right spot at the right time.
But what about that 3 star weak foot though?
It’s not ideal of course, but it’s not even close to being a serious problem. Maradona’s attributes are so good that you don’t really worry about his weak foot except for outside the box or contested shots.
The only real downside to Prime Icon Maradona is his low stamina. At striker, he can stay fit for the match, but he has more uses at CAM.
At CAM, he never really tracks back (which helps save stamina), but you’ll find yourself tracking back with him manually and wasting precious stamina. Or you track back with a striker which ends up being a longer journey, giving your opponent more time to score.
So it’s really important that your midfield can support a player who’s mainly useless on defense.
If you've always relied on having 1 defensive minded CM, with Maradona, you might need 2 if you’re not constantly on the attack.
If you can strike that balance with your squad, Maradona easily becomes a must have player. He’s one of the few Prime Icons that wins matches on his own, and we’ve yet to see a card with positioning as clever as his.
Have you used Maradona? Tell us what you think of him on Twitter.

The Mystery Of FIFA 18 Goalkeepers
 

 
Goalkeepers in FIFA 18 are terrible. No wait, they’re great. Just kidding, they suck. Wait a second, they rock. Goalkeepers...
FIFA 18 has been patched many times, and sometimes there have been changes that weren't fully documented. However, at launch, keepers simply didn’t do their job.
Even after a few patches, the likes of De Gea and Neuer were still letting in howlers on a regular basis. The sentiment of “don’t waste coins on a high rated GK” became very common.
But over the past month or so, goalkeepers seem to have gotten good again. With cards like 99 Ronaldo not being able to get past De Gea as often as CR7’s attribute suggest, it all gets very confusing.
Has this been the experience for you as well? Or have you been too burned by goalkeepers in the past and haven’t invested in a high rated on yet?
Tell us all about your GK experience on Twitter, it would be good to get a better sense of how keepers are performing these days.

Is “Park The Bus” and “Counter Attack” Coming Back To FIFA 18’s Weekend League?
 

 
For the past few weekends, we’ve noticed an increased number in ultra low pressure players, putting many men behind the ball and hoping for an easy counter attack.
As you might recall, this was a super popular tactic early on in FIFA 18 and 17. It relies heavily on the AI and the frustration of the attacking player.
If you ever want to annoy a FIFA vet, just lovingly whisper “PTB+CT” into their ear.
This preservation strategy won’t get you 40 wins during the Weekend League, but if you’re a very inconsistent FIFA player, it can definitely get you more wins than a traditional style of play.
With automatic Weekend League entry reduced from 18 to 11 wins, we might be seeing the long term effects of that now.
You can surely make the argument that a skilled player can overcome this defensive tactic, but at the same time, there are so many AI elements to FIFA that are outside of anyone’s control. It’s also possible that the current PTB trend is more of a fad, with less experienced players playing more of the WL and trying to survive whilst building experience.
Either way, it’s interesting to see the Weekend League’s meta go through phases throughout the year.

TOTW16 Predictions,02-Jan-18 15:12,"Starting Eleven
Ederson 
With the incredible season Manchester City are having, it seems strange to find a player without an inform already. This being said, when Crystal Palace received a last minute penalty, the unbeaten season looked likely to end. Ederson however was ready, and although it was his only save of the game, with so few matches it may just be enough.
Trent Alexander Arnold 
Liverpool were hosts to Swansea early last week and in a dominating performance, they took all 3 points in a comfortable 5-0 victory. With several stand out performances, taking the spotlight away from Coutinho or Firmino was difficult, but with the lack of defenders having standout matches, a goal and clean sheet here may just be enough.
Rudiger 
Chelsea were hosts to Stoke for their Premier League fixture on the weekend, and in a 5 goal masterclass, Chelsea were the only side ever in contention. With a goal and a clean sheet from the back, Rudiger secures himself a spot in this week’s predictions.
Wague 
Watford were at home to Leicester in the first if their Premier League games last week and in a resilient performance, they managed to secure all the points. In a 2-1 victory, it was their CB Wague who was solid at the back and also scored the winner.
Alli 
Last year it became a fairly regular occurrence to see Alli feature in the team of the week, player of the month nominations or at least on the scoresheet, this year however is a whole different scenario. On Tuesday, Tottenham beat Southampton 5-2 at Home, with Kane scoring yet another hat-trick. As he featured in the current TOTW, we need to look elsewhere, so Alli and Son with their 1 goal and 1 assist are next in line.
Hamsik 
With the majority of leagues still on their festive break, finding a player not from he premier League is a breath of fresh air. Napoli were away to a struggling Crotone on the weekend and while they only managed a 1-0 victory, with Hamsik the scorer, a single goal this week may just be enough.
Willian 
Back to the Premier League again now where we find our second Chelsea selection of the week. The concern is, that both selections come from Chelsea’s 5-0 win over Stoke. During this match, Willian was incredible, dominating the pitch, assisting twice and even scoring from the spot too.
Pogba 
Manchester United were away to Everton on the weekend and after recent results, they really needed to get back into winning form. Luckily, that’s exactly what happened and in a 2-0 win, it was Pogba who really stood out, assisting both the goals.
Sanchez 
Arsenal were away to Crystal Palace last Thursday and in a 5 goal thriller, they just managed to edge out the win and secure a much needed 3 points. During their 3-2 victory, it was Sanchez who stood out, scoring twice and saving Arsenal once again.
Salah 
We find our second Liverpool selection of the week, and is a name we should all be familiar with by now! Liverpool were at home to Leicester on the weekend and during a 2-1 victory Salah was once again the player who stole the show. Scoring both the goals, he has given himself a great chance at yet another Inform.
Dybala 
For our final selection in this starting eleven, we once again move across to the Serie A. Juventus were away to Verona on the weekend and in a 3-1 victory it was Dybala who stole the show. With two goals and a dominating display, surely we will be seeing a second Inform for this young superstar.
 
Substitutes
Perin 
For our first substitute we remain within the Serie A where we find Genoa away to Torino. In a game of 0 goals, it was Genoa’s backline that really impressed, including their goalkeeper Perin. With a total of 6 saves and a clean sheet, he gets the nod as our second goalkeeper this week.
Albrighton 
Leicester were hosts to Huddersfield for one of their league clashes last week and in a promising 3-0 win, a couple of players really stood out. Both Mahrez and Albrighton finished the game with both a goal and an assist, but seeing as Mahrez has already secured two informs this season, Albrighton is our pick here.
Fraser 
A struggling Bournemouth played hosts to Everton on the weekend and with the addition of a new manager, most expected an away win. Bournemouth however came with a mission, a mission in which they succeeded. In a 2-1 victory, it was Fraser who really stood out, scoring both the goals and securing the points.
Quagliarella 
Heading back over to Italy now where Sampdoria were hosts to the travelling SPAL. In a 2-0 win for the home side, it was Quagliarella who stole the show, scoring both goals and dominating the game.
Coda 
We remain in the Serie A for this selection and while this may not be a pick that normally receives recognition, I feel like this would be deserved. Benevento are still yet to ever record a first division victory and as they hosted Chievo on the weekend, few expected this to change. A single goal decided the game, a goal from Coda, a very special goal that gave Benevento their first ever Serie A victory.
Flanagan 
Burton were on the road this weekend to Sheffield Wednesday and in a brilliant showing they travelled back with all 3 points. In a 3-0 victory, it was their defender Flanagan who stole the show, scoring, assisting and keeping a clean sheet is surely enough to nail down a spot this week.
Pinnock 
Barnsley were away to Sunderland in their Championship match and in a game of very few goals, they also left as 1-0 victors. Pinnock was the man who scored this goal and when we add this to a flawless defensive display, he also makes this shortlist.
Snodgrass 
A struggling Aston Villa were hosts to a Bristol City side that were in the form of their lives and while most expected an away win, nobody could have predicted what actually took place. In a 5-0 thrashing for Aston Villa, everybody was superb, but the player making our shortlist today is Snodgrass with 2 goals and a man of the match award.
Braithwaite 
Middlesbrough were hosts to Bolton in this Championship fixture and it was the home side who left as 2-0 victors. Braithwaite was the player who really stole the show, scoring one and assisting the second.
Winnall 
Derby were away to Ipswich for this league fixture and in a game of three goals, it was the away side who took all the points. Winnall was the key man in this performance, scoring twice during the 2-1 win and rightfully securing the man of the match award.
Bobo 
We head over to Australia now where we find Sydney FC hosting Perth Glory. In a game of 6 goals, only one side were ever in contention and in a comfortable 6-0 win, it was Bobo who managed to secure himself a hat-trick and possibly a second Inform.
Douglas 
Our final pick sees us head back to England’s second division where league leaders Wolves were away to second placed Bristol City. In a game that saw two red cards and endless opportunities, Douglas was the player who stood out. In a 2-1 victory, he scored once and assisted the second, ensuring Wolves stay safely atop the table."
FUT FM EPISODE 45,05-Apr-18 16:57,"Hey comrades, the legendary Air Japes joins us this week, and he’s got an exciting announcement. He’ll be commentating over the upcoming eMLS Cup!

Roberto Firmino SIF 87 Review

Both Goran and Valerio have been playing with 87 Firmino for some time now, and they love him.
He’s a silky smooth dribbler with 91 Ball Control and 93 Dribbling, while his 90 Finishing makes him a lethal goalscorer.
On top of that, his 91 Short Passing ensures that link up play with him is almost always easy.
Those are just some of the key highlights. Firmino is generally an excellent all around player, with a whopping 2305 in game stats spread out across important categories for a CAM.
You could even play him at striker or as a central midfielder if you wanted to.
Plus, Firmino’s got an excellent height to weight ratio for someone with his attributes and position. He doesn’t get bounced off the ball easily and is surprisingly good at defending despite his obvious weakness in that area.
While there is no real downside to 87 Firmino, if you have plenty of coins to work with, you can probably find a player that specializes in something specific.
Do you want a long shot master? Perhaps a finesse wizard suits your style. Or maybe you want a 5 star skiller?
Firmino can do a little bit of everything, but you can find a top tier player that does any 1 thing better. But if you don’t have those coins, Firmino is an easy pick for any squad.
As always, thanks for checking out FUT FM! Be sure to subscribe to the show on iTunes/Apple Podcasts, or Android to never miss an episode.

"From 0 to 1,000,000 Coins - Part I",20-Jan-18 16:22,"So here it is, the guide you have all been waiting for (even if you didn’t know it), the guide that could potentially change your entire life! We will be taking a completely fresh account and slowly working our way up from 0 to 1,000,000 coins! So buckle in and get ready for one hell of a bumpy ride!
First things first, we have just loaded up the game, logged into FUT and are faced with some basic options like choosing kits, a loan player and even a badge. These choices are all fairly irrelevant, choose whichever you like the most and skip forward until you find yourself on the main FUT menu. Now we are ready to start things off.

EA Catalogue
The EA catalogue is located in the top right of the screen and while accessible to everyone, certain items require both a certain EA level from the user as well as a certain amount of EA coins. Now both of these are obtained by simply playing the game, whether offline or online, but ultimately they take a fair while to increase.
For the purpose of this guide we will simply assume nobody has access, however if you do there are a few items we want to unlock as soon as we possibly can:
1. Additional transfer space. These will allow you to list more items at any given time on the transfer market, up to a total of 100.
2. Balls, kits and contracts. These will provide a small boost to income in the early stages of the game. The balls and kits can be quick sold for a small chunk of coins while the contracts offer 99 matches each and hence can be sold on the transfer market.
3. Coin boosts. Each of these provide the user a coin boost for each game they complete. The value ranges from an additional 200 coins a match all the way up to an additional 1000 coins a match. These cannot be stacked, so use them one at a time for maximum efficiency.
4. Loan players. Completely optional here, but if you fancy giving your squad a nice early boost, you can sign some of the top players for a few games, giving you that edge in those early matches.
As mentioned above, none of this is needed to proceed with the guide, however if they are available then they each provide a nice little boost and ultimately speed up the process in the early stages.

Daily/Weekly Challenges
A new addition to FUT this year sees the release of both daily and weekly objectives added to each players profile. Now once again these are not vital for proceeding, however some of them are incredibly simple to complete and can provide anything from a few hundred coins up to a wide variety of packs.
Sometimes you will find yourself completing these by accident and at other times they will be so simple that you simply have to complete them. Either way, these will add a small amount of coins to our overall balance as we progress through the stages.

Maximising Player Value
This is the part where most people act irrationally. Yes, the whole point of this game mode is to slowly upgrade your team so that eventually you have your absolute dream players, however it’s just like in real life, those who save their pay-checks and invest, will always be better off in the long run than those who simply splash the cash.
Upon loading FUT we are each provided with a starter side consisting of bronze players, a few silvers and even a couple of golds. Now while this team is anything but competitive, it is definitely more than enough to kick start off our grind. These players each have full fitness, enough contracts to get through a bunch of games and hence they will be the players we use to start with.
My advice here, is to simply use this side until they run out of contracts or their fitness gets to a level that simply becomes unplayable. Either way, this should easily be enough to get you up until the end of this part of the guide. 
For those fearful that this will become their life, fear not! Next time we start playing matches, we will ensure our team is improved significantly, but with a cause as well.
Remember that if you really need a change and you have catalogue points, you can unlock some of those loan players to give you that boost.
 
Playing Matches
Right, so here we are, finally we can start actually playing this game that we spent a fortune on! As mentioned above, we have our team and we are ready to rock and roll! 
Now we have two options here:
1. Online seasons. The benefits here are that you will be playing online against other players and that after each division is completed you will be receiving a coin bonus based on how you finish.
2. Squad Battles. A new feature to FUT this year sees players given the option to play a competitive mode of FIFA against the AI. While we will not be receiving rewards for completing seasons, we will be granted a bonus amount of coins and packs based on the amount of points we achieve weekly.
Both methods of gameplay have their merits and both will achieve the same outcome down the line, it’s predominantly personal preference as to which route you choose to take here.
Now while the coins we are receiving are fantastic, it’s going to be one hell of a grind if this is all we do. That’s why each time we complete a match and gather some coins, we are going to be putting them to the best possible use.

Bronze Pack Method (BPM)
Bronze Pack Method, the holy grail of trading for any new trader. There are a million guides and walkthroughs that cover this method, however we are obviously going to be linking the absolute best one around, ours! – Link to Bronze Pack Method
As the guide explains, we will simply be opening the 400 coin packs and then listing anything and everything that has even the slightest chance of selling. This isn’t a get rich quick scheme or anything of the sort, it is a slow and steady grind that not only provides short term profit but also stacks our clubs with hundreds of players and consumables for later use as well. 
Keep in mind that this guide is a few months old and with the market as it is now, things may be slightly different (individual fitness cards are tougher to sell as an example), however you will quickly start to learn and remember what you want to be checking and what you know simply will not sell, massively speeding up this process along the way.
To maximise efficiency within these early stages, we want to be opening as many bronze packs as we can after each match. Whether it’s 1 or 10, by acting in this manner we ensure that the transfer list is constantly being refreshed as items sell or expire, allowing us to refill it with minimum effort.

Achieving Our Goal
As mentioned, this guide should take you all the way up to around 15,000 coins. Some people may get extremely lucky with a bronze pack allowing them to get there almost instantly, while for others it may be a slightly longer grind. In reality though, this should be taking a few hours at most and will set us up perfectly for the second part of these guides!"
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,15-Mar-18 16:03,"Once again, we come to a point in the footballing calendar where the majority of leagues take a break to accommodate for International Friendlies. Now while there are a handful of larger matches taking place, the sheer volume of quantity of games happening over the next week or so is simply gigantic, leaving it extremely difficult for us to predict exactly which games will feature. 
So, as we come across such a difficult time in terms of investments, how can we best spread the risk in order to minimalize potential losses and at the same time maximize potential gains? Well luckily this is something that we can cover and explain with relative ease across this article! To start with however, let's get into some of the larger games taking place! 

Germany vs Spain
First up we have a clash between two of the world's strongest International teams. With Germany currently holding the #1 spot on the ranking's table, Spain aren’t far behind in #6 and while Spain may have age and experience in abundance, the youthful German side looks more dangerous than ever. Investments for all these games should be simple enough, if you're not looking at gold players, you're looking in the wrong place! 

Netherlands vs England
After the recent heartbreak of falling short during the qualification stages, Holland have absolutely nothing to lose during this match against England. With England currently sitting at #16 in the world ranking and Netherlands at #21, on paper there really isn't much that separates these two nations either. Once again, it's gold, gold, gold when it comes to investments, just remember to consider rating and rarity as well. 

Russia vs Brazil
Next up we head over to Russia, where we find the hosts of the 2018 World Cup welcoming a rejuvenated and scary looking Brazil. Russia currently sit at #63 in the world rankings, while the visitors, Brazil, are all the way up at #2. On paper this looks likely to deliver one-way traffic, with a smooth and comfortable win for Brazil, however when any two International teams meet, expect the unexpected!  

Italy vs Argentina
The final game we will be taking a look at this week features Italy, a team who provided the entire world with a shock after failing to qualify for the World Cup. The hosts currently sit at #14 in the world rankings, while Argentina with their superstar packed attacking lineup, sits way up the table at #4. With Italy having nothing to lose and Argentinian players trying to nail down their place in the team, we could perhaps be treated to one hell of a match! 

Ensuring You Get The Most Out Of Your Investments
Right, so we briefly touched on making these investments as strong as possible and now it's finally time to jump into a little more detail around how we can execute this. As many of you will be aware, EA releases League SBC's across the year. Each league consists of an individual challenge for each team within the league and then ultimately a prize SBC player for completing them all. As it stands we currently have four leagues left that we expect to see; La Liga, Premier League, Pro League and Scottish League.  
It is incredibly easy for us to simply use these above predictions and pick up any old gold player from the mentioned nationalities, however if we were to double down on these selections, we give ourselves multiple chances of success, while significantly reducing the chance of failure. Buy Brazilian players from La Liga, or Argentinian players from the Premier League, however you decide to go about this, or whichever match you decide to invest in, just remember that we can make our investments really work for us this time!"
Marquee Matchups,08-Oct-17 15:25,"Last week saw a break from domestic competitions, with the 2018 World Cup Qualifiers taking their place. With most countries having two fixtures during this period, predicting which games EA would choose became a tall order to say the least and with a result of 2 correct from 6 guesses, we had a fairly successful week. This week sees a return to the standard league matches, and hopefully an even stronger prediction will follow! 
 
Remember as always, even if we correctly predict the games, we still need to account for formations, chemistry, rating, nationality and clubs. Always make your investments as safe as possible by eliminating the risk some of these can cause. 
 
Liverpool vs Manchester United 
Manchester United sit second in the Premier League to local rivals Manchester City, separated by not even a point, but a single goal. This week sees them travel to longtime rivals Liverpool for the North-West derby. Can Liverpool continue their top four challenge or will United simply destroy them, much like their immediate rivals Manchester City have? 

  
Atletico Madrid vs Barcelona 
Moving across to Spain for the second fixture, and once again we see two of the biggest teams in the league go head to head. Despite a disastrous transfer window, Barcelona sit 5 points clear atop the table, having yet to drop a single point. Atletico are amongst the chasing pack, and whilst remain undefeated have already drawn 3 games. Can Barcelona continue this incredible streak or will Atletico be the first team to steal some points away from the league leaders? 

 
Inter Milan vs AC Milan 
We head over to Italy for these next few predictions and begin with one of the largest rivalries in the league, the Milan derby. Despite the influx of funds AC received, their start to the season would be described as average at best. With 4 wins and 3 losses from their 7 games, it seems like they need time to allow their new signings to settle. On the other hand, the competition has had an explosive start and even Inter have only dropped 2 points from their 7 games so far. Is this where AC can turn things around, or will Inter simply stride further ahead? 
 
Juventus vs Lazio 
Now while the Milan derby appears to be the obvious choice for investment we know better than to simply fall into such a trap. That’s why we have not one, not two, but three fixtures as a possibility here. Second place Juventus host fourth place Lazio in what is likely to be another heated match. With just 3 points separating the teams, can Lazio take this opportunity to close in on last year's champions? 

 
Roma vs Napoli 
The final game in the Serie A that we will be looking at sees top of the table Napoli travelling to fifth place Roma (who also have a game in hand). A win here for Roma, alongside a win in their extra game, would see things all level at the top and hence piles on the pressure with the importance of this match. Can Napoli hold their ground and continue their perfect start to the season, or will Roma be the contenders that prove to be too much? 
 
Remember, that investing in one or all three games is never a bad decision. The challenge is likely to require a full eleven players and having extras available from the same league will always be useful. 
 
Dortmund vs RB Leipzig 
With an extremely shaky start to the season from last year's winners Bayern Munich, Dortmund find themselves atop the table having won 6 and drawn just the 1 game. RB Leipzig also continue their fantastic form from last season, sitting fourth in the table, 6 points off the leaders but just 1 point from second and third. While this isn't quite as big as the other choices we have, it feels like a worth mention to simply cover all basis. Can Dortmund continue their unbeaten run or will it be Leipzig who stop them in their tracks? 
 
Lyon vs Marseille 
We move onto Ligue 1 next where two of the bigger teams, by name, come face to face. With Marseille sitting in third place 6 points off unbeaten leaders PSG and Lyon in eighth with 4 draws from 8 games already, there isn't all that much riding on this match. However, we do see a large rivalry between the two teams, with the derby known as ""Choc Des Olympiques"". Is it unlikely to see this match with so many other big games taking place elsewhere, or is this the kind of curveball EA love to throw at us? 
 
Melbourne Victory vs Melbourne City 
The final game we are looking at today will be from the A-League. We see the two Melbourne sides, Melbourne Victory vs Melbourne City go head to head. Now while this game isn't quite as mainstream as the others we have mentioned, it doesn’t mean we should ignore it. With only silver and bronze cards available from the two teams, we could see a much larger increase in profits if needed, however we also run the risk of seeing the new ""blocks"" used by EA for such a fixture. The only question here is, can we find the value? 
 
As you can see there are plenty of options available this week, this is simply my shortlist from dozens of potential candidates. When investing always look for the highest possible value. Which challenges will likely require the most players? Which investments are rarer on the market and hence should rise more? Which challenges have a chance of having ""blocks"" instead of players required? Will I lose much if my investments are wrong? Do I sell on hype or after the event is released? If you are answering these questions, then your investments instantly become a lot stronger."
TOTW 31 Predictions,16-Apr-18 15:01,"Starting Eleven
Picking our selections was tougher than ever this week. So many players had a great match and stats, figures and ratings were all so similar that people simply had to be left out. Make sure you take a look at the honorable mentions list at the end of this article, as we highlight all those that we believe could make the final cut!
Donnarumma 
AC Milan were hosts to Napoli for their Serie A clash this weekend and despite both sides best efforts, the match ended in a 0-0 draw. Now this certainly wouldn't have been the case if it wasn't for the youngster, Donnarumma, in goal. His performance across the 90 minutes was fantastic and his save in the final moments of stoppage time was absolutely breathtaking to say the least.
Naldo 
Germany is our next stop, where we find Schalke and Dortmund facing off towards the top of the table. With Champions League spaces so tight, both sides were desperate for the three points here, but despite Dortmund's best efforts, it simply wasn't their day. With Batshuayi out for the season and a 2-0 loss to Schalke, things are looking pretty bleak for them, however Schalke's fortunes are a completely different story. Naldo was the man of the match, a defensive masterclass to ensure the clean sheet alongside one of the two goals, perfection.
Raul Silva 
Portugal is where we find our second center-back of this line up, and what a phenomenal season Raul Silva has had. Time after time he is defensively brilliant, while constantly proving he has something to contribute to the attack as well. While he may not have quite managed a clean sheet, with the match ending 5-1, the 3 assists he provided will surely more than make up for this.
Svensson 
AZ Alkmaar were on the road to Heracles for their weekend fixture, and in a game of three goals, all three went to the visitors. Not only was Svensson absolutely brilliant at the back, but he proved that he also has a has a brilliant attacking mentality. Providing two assists and maintaining the clean sheet, should be enough for his spot this week.
Debuchy 
Saint-Etienne were away to Strasbourg for their Ligue 1 match and in a an incredibly tight match, it was the visitors who managed to steal a 1-0 win. The ex-Arsenal defender, Debuchy, was the man of the hour, defensively great and also the scorer of the game's only goal.
Isco 
Real Madrid are most likely still celebrating their last-minute winner against Juventus last week, now whether or not the penalty was correct is still debatable, however Isco's incredible performance on the weekend is something that we can all agree on. Madrid beat Malaga 2-1 and Isco played a part in both goals, scoring once and assisting the second.
Lo Celso 
PSG may have already won the league, but this doesn’t mean they want to let momentum slip. Once again, they showed just how dominant they are in France, with an incredible 7-1 victory over Monaco. Now there were plenty of possible team of the week candidates, however Lo Celso, with 2 goals and an incredible match rating, is the man who receives our pick.
Thiago 
Bayern Munich were hosts to Gladbach for their weekend fixture, and while the league may already be wrapped up, they once again showed their quality and just why they are in the final four of the Champions League. In a dominating 5-1 victory, there were plenty of players who could have made our list. Wagner with 2 goals, Muller with 2 assists, Alaba with a goal, but we decided that Thiago was the man for us. With a goal and the man of the match award, could we see yet another PTG receive an upgrade this week?
Coutinho
Staying in Spain for this selection, as we move from Madrid to their biggest rivals, Barcelona. Surprisingly both sides managed to secure the same result, with the same score line, and the one thing that Isco and Coutinho have in common this week, is that both goals included themselves. Coutinho may not have actually scored, however providing both assists and securing the man of the match award may just be enough to see him pick up his first Barcelona inform.
Douglas Costa 
Juventus were hosts to Sampdoria for their league fixture and in a comfortable 3-0 victory, there were plenty of standout performances. Now this was a tougher decision than it needed to be, as while Costa provided 3 assists and was simply breathtaking, Howedes was also monumental at the back, ensuring the clean sheet and also scoring one of the goals. While Costa is our pick, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Howedes sneak into the lineup, either instead of or alongside his team-mate.
Giroud 
While Arsenal continue to struggle when attempting to find consistency, players that have left the club this year continue to strive. Giroud has most likely secured himself his first Chelsea inform since his January transfer after coming on as a super-sub and turning a 0-2 score line into a 3-2 victory for Chelsea. Two goals are usually enough for a Premier League striker and I would expect to see this man make the list.
 
Substitutes
Foster 
Bottom of the table and practically relegated West Brom were away to a Manchester United side who have a near flawless home record in the league. This match was meant to be one-way traffic, however is proof that stats and figures mean absolutely nothing, it's all about how players preform on the day. West Brom left as 1-0 winners, and while the whole team was incredible, Foster in goal is the man who gets our vote.
Mariano 
Galatasary were at home to Istanbul Basaksehir for their weekend fixture and in a game of just two goals, both went in favor of the hosts. Mariano was brilliant from start to finish, defensively fantastic and also devastating going forward. With a clean sheet and a goal to his name, we could be seeing this man's first inform of the year.
Halliche
Estoril were on the road this weekend, as they travelled to Portimonense for their league fixture. The match itself was incredibly tight, and a single goal was all that seperated the two sides. Halliche was the man behind this goal and when we consider that this man is a center-back, who was also defensively perfect, we have a real team of the week contender on our hands.
Moralez 
Over to America next where New York City FC played hosts to Salt Lake for their MLS fixture. It looks like the visitors may not have had the best of journeys, as they were dominated from start to finish in a match that ended 4-0. Moralez was simply breathtaking throughout, scoring once, assisting another and picking up a near perfect match rating as well.
Miranchuk 
Russia is our next destination, where we found Dinamo Moscow and Lokomotiv Moscow going head to head in the Moscow derby. Sadly, this match was all one-way traffic from the start, with the visitors ending the game as 4-0 winners. Miranchuk was unstoppable, scoring twice and absolutely terrifying Dinamo's defense.
Perez 
After Arsenal picked up an early goal through Lacazette, it looked like they had finally found some form and would continue to pick up their third league win in a row. For those of us that believed this however, we were in for a surprise. A 29th minute goal from Perez evened up the match before half-time and then a winner from Ritchie secured the points mid-way through the second half. A game like this deserves some recognition, and Perez with a goal and an assist is the man who gets it here.
McGree
Our next trip takes us across the world, down to Australia, where Central Coast Mariners and Newcastle Jets played out their weekend fixture. The game itself consisted of 10 goals, 8 of which went in favor of the visitors. McGree was simply unstoppable, scoring not once, not twice, but three times to secure his hat-trick and 3 points for his club.
Babel 
Besiktas were on the road this weekend as they travelled to their hosts, Akhisarspor. The match ended 3-0 to Besiktas and while there were plenty of top tier performances, Babel was simply incredible throughout. Scoring twice and causing all sorts of problems for the opposition, he gets our vote this week.
Linssen
Vitesse were at home to Sparta Rotterdam for their weekend fixture, and in a game that provided us with 7 goals, all 7 went in favor of the hosts. Linssen was practically perfect, scoring twice, assisting a third and securing himself a perfect 10.0 match rating.
Zaha 
The Premier League relegation battle is in full swing, and with so many sides still within reach of the drop, each and every point has never meant more. Crystal Palace were hosts to relegation rivals Brighton on the weekend, and in a 5-goal thriller, they just managed to edge out a 3-2 victory. Zaha was the man of the hour, scoring twice and dominating the attack.
Harbaoui
Zulte-Waregem were hosts to Royal Excel Mouscron and during a 6-goal match, 5 of them went in favor of the hosts. Harbaoui was simply amazing, scoring not once, not twice, not even three times, but four, yes four goals during this win. If we don’t see this man make the line-up, then there is something seriously wrong with EA's selection process.
Volland
Over to Germany for our final selection, where Leverkusen picked up a comfortable 4-1 win over Frankfurt. Volland was devastating up top, terrorizing the oppositions defense and picking himself up a hat-trick in the process.
 
Honorable mentions
As always picking a squad of just 23 players is incredibly difficult, and while someone may believe a certain player is deserving, you can almost guarantee others will disagree. Below is a list of players that just missed out this week, and although they didn’t make our shortlist, I would expect a couple of them to pop up in EA's selections!

TOTW7 Predictions,30-Oct-17 19:16,"Starting Eleven
Mandanda 
A single goal separated the game between Lille and Marseille in this Ligue 1 fixture, and while it was Lille who dominated, it was Marseille who took the points. A combination of fantastic saves secured the clean sheet and ultimately secured the 3 points.
Maffeo 
We saw a huge upset in La Liga yesterday, when Girona took the points against Real Madrid. It was a fantastic performance from the entire team but Maffeo, their right back really stood out. Solid at the back while assisting a goal in the 2-1 victory has given him a spot in these predictions.
Jorgensen 
Sapsborg 08 breezed past opposition Sandefjord 5-0 in their weekend fixture and while the entire team was fantastic, it was Jorgensen their centre back who shone the brightest. With 2 goals and a clean sheet in the game, surely he has done enough.
Watson 
We head over to the MLS now and Vancouver were hosts to San Jose. A comfortable 5-0 victory in this playoff game was fantastic, while the clean sheet, goal and assist Watson secured was on a whole different level.
Kolasniac 
Over to the Premier League now and Arsenal were hosts to Swansea. It was their summer signing and LWB, Kolasniac who stole the show. With a goal and an assist in the 2-1 victory, hopefully he picks up his first inform in an Arsenal kit.
Sarabia 
Back to La Liga now and Sevilla were the hosts to Leganes. In a tightly contested game, the hosts left with the points in a 2-1 victory. Sarabia was the hero here, scoring one and creating the second.
Rodriguez 
Just like last week when we saw Tolisso make the predictions, we have another slightly controversial choice here. Bayern were 2-0 winners during their weekend fixture with Rodriguez and Lewandowski scoring. Rodriguez was the player who put in the stronger performance, and has hence given himself a real chance this week.
Fernandinho 
Another week, another fixture and yet another win for Manchester City. While Sane provided yet another goal and assist, he looks set to achieve a potm award and hence we turn our attention to Fernandinho. A goal and an assist from midfield in this 3-2 victory, is hopefully enough to also land a spot in the team of the week.
Brahimi 
Porto travelled to Boa Vista for their weekend match, and the journey wasn't wasted. In a comfortable 3-0 victory Brahimi provided a goal and an assist to ensure all 3 points went to the visitors.
Cavani 
PSG were hosts to Nice on the weekend, and once again it wasn't the OTW cards with the standout performances. Cavani scored twice in the 3-0 victory while Di Maria put in a fantastic performance with 2 assists. While Cavani made the predictions, I wouldn't be surprised to find Di Maria sneak in.
Higuain 
After a countless number of informs last year, it looks like Higuain could finally have his first from the new season. Juventus were away to AC Milan and Higuain scored both goals in their 2-0 victory. Could this be the start of the dominance he showed last year?
 
Substitutes
Mertens
Mertens has already secured himself an inform this season, so a second one isn't easy to achieve. This being said, Mertens scored twice on Wednesday to help Napoli pull off a 3-2 victory over Genoa and he then scored again vs Sassuolo in a 3-1 victory. This might just be enough to find himself on a SIF already.
Torreira
Sampdoria were hosts to Chievo in this Serie A fixture. It was the hosts who secured the points with a 4-1 victory and their CM, Torreira, who scored two of those goals.
Bebou
Off to the Bundesliga now and Hannover greeted the travelling Dortmund with plenty of confidence. Despite the odds, Hannover pulled off a 4-2 victory with their striker Bebou netting two of the goals. Hopefully this is enough.
Bastos
The weekend games seemed to lack stand out defensive performances, which is why we see Bastos sneak into the mix. Lazio were away to Benevento and although Insigne was the star, his recent inform is likely to prevent a second so soon. Fingers crossed for Bastos on Wednesday!
Lozano
PSV were away to Vitesse in their weekend fixture, and once again it was the away team who stole the show. In a 4-2 victory it was Lozano who played a massive part in 3 of the goals. Scoring twice himself and assisting on the third, this should be enough to secure his spot.
Til
AZ Alkmaar were on the road this weekend but the journey was worth it. In a 2-1 victory it was their CAM Til who scored both the goals and single handedly secured the 3 points.
Dowell
Back to England now where we saw Hull play hosts to Nottingham Forest in a 5 goal thriller. It was the away team who left with the points, and their CM Dowell who scored all 3 of the goals. This one is surely a lock.
Farfan
We move to Russia for this choice, where Zenit were hosts to Lokomotiv Moscow. It seems to be a trend with these predictions, because the away team took the points again. In a 3-0 victory, Farfan scored twice and assisted the third.
Smolov
Staying in Russia for this choice and finally we see a home team win. Krasnodar took on SKA Khabarovsk and took the points comfortably in a 4-1 victory. Smolov was the star of the show, scoring twice and picking up an assist. One goal was from the spot, hopefully this doesn't hurt his chances.
Kaminski
We get to our substitute goalkeeper selection now, and it's a rightfully deserved pick. Kortijk were hosts to Gene in this fixture and while one team showed dominance, Kaminski was not a man to beaten. The game ended 0-0, and it was all thanks to this goalkeeper.
Gregoritsch
Over to Germany now and Weser Bremen were hosts to Augsburg in this Bundesliga match. It was the away team who left smiling, with their CM Gregoritsch picking up two of the goals in a 3-0 victory.
Peterson
Heracles were hosts to VVV-Venlo in their weekend fixture and in a comfortable 3-0 win, it was their wingers who really stood out. On the left Peterson bagged two goals while on the right his teammate picked up a goal and an assist. Let's hope Peterson did enough this time."
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,19-May-18 07:03,"With most domestic seasons already having come to an end, picking our predictions can instantly become a lot more difficult. With a whole heap of international friendlies, playoff games and cup finals to choose from, we really are spoilt for choice this week.
 
Liverpool vs Real Madrid
First up we have what can only be described as the biggest game of the year, the Champions League final, and as a Liverpool fan, to say I was excited would be nothing short of an understatement. With gold prices already inflated, the Europa League final already having featured, and lack of lower tier gold cards, investments here could prove to be very lucrative indeed.
 
Fulham vs Aston Villa
Next up we have one of the most lucrative matches in world football, with the winner receiving a one way ticket up to the Premier League. Fulham overcame a 1st leg loss to book their ticket here, while Aston Villa suffered 90 minutes of boring football to maintain their first leg lead. While we have gold cards available, get in fast and aim for discard, otherwise settle for silvers here.
 
FC Zuerich vs Young Boys
Another game and another Cup final now, with FC Zuerich and Young Boys facing off in the final of the Swiss Cup. Luckily we have plenty of available gold cards in which we can invest here. Keep things simple, consider positions, nationality and of course, prices.
 
Rosenborg vs Bran
No way is our next stop, where we find second place Rosenborg playing host to league leaders Bran. Not only does this game feature the top two sides in he League, but it also carries historical relevance and a rivalry between the two sides. Investments here are fine at any rarity, just aim to keep the cost down.
 
LA Galaxy vs San Jose Earthquakes
Over to America next, where LA Galaxy and San Jose Earthquakes face off, in a derby known as the “California Clasico”. Investments here vary depending on how  early you are able to buy. The key is discard prices, don’t overspend and you won’t be left with regret!
 
Sporting KC vs Columbus
Now, as usual, when we cover multiple games from a single league, at best we are expecting one of them to feature. Keep this in mind when it comes to investments, and don’t expect both to pop up! Sporting KC play Columbus in our second selection in the MLS, 2nd place against 3rd. Investments here should revolve around discard bronze or silver, to reduce risk.
 
International Friendlies
Now while we have a whole heap of international friendlies to choose from, picking out a single match proves to be extremely difficult. Instead, picking up players from the more unique nationalities could help to cover all bases, and even potentially provide a lucky investment too!"
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,31-Oct-17 18:15,"Once again we reach a period of the season where International games take over and while we still have options in the lower leagues, EA have previously favoured a full International line-up, hence that's where we will be picking from.
A lot of the upcoming fixtures revolve around WC qualification and while there are plenty of friendlies to choose, it would baffle me to see them included. Based on this, we will be looking at the entire fixture list for WC games and slightly changing the article up. Instead of looking at the best possible games (as it would be incredibly difficult to actually predict these), we will be focusing on how we can maximise value from potential investments.
 
The Fixtures:

European WC Playoffs
Croatia vs Greece
Northern Ireland vs Switzerland
Sweden vs Italy
Denmark vs Republic Of Ireland

African WC Qualifiers
Algeria vs Nigeria
South Africa vs Senegal
Congo vs Guinea
Tunisia vs Libya
Zambia vs Cameroon
Gabon vs Mali
Ivory Coast vs Morocco

Inter Confederation WC Playoffs
Honduras vs Australia
New Zealand vs Peru
 
Number Of Players Required
In this section we aren't talking about how many players fill an 11 player team, we are considering how many players from the selected matchup will be required. 
Some games require ""1 player from team X or Y"". As you can imagine, supply can easily fill this demand and it is times like this where we see minimal profit available from our investments.
Some games can require ""2 players from team X and 2 players from team Y"". These are the golden choices, demand can outweigh supply causing prices to increase significantly and along with it our profits.
It's not easy to predict the actual requirements, however we can improve our chances. A lower tier game is unlikely to require 4 players from the clubs, whereas the bigger matches could. 
 
Rarity Of Players Required
This requirement usually targets the higher tier games and is commonly seen when gold players are involved. With the bigger matches always remember that picking up a non rare gold for 400 coins carries the same risk as picking up a rare gold card for 650 coins. Both options are picked up for discard, but one ticks more boxes instantly. If there is a variety of cards available, the rare gold choices can often give you that edge.
 
Rating Of Players Required
This one is simple. If you can bid on a bronze or silver player for 150, you are obviously going to choose the silver one. The same logic goes for gold players, if you can bid on a 76 rated player and 80 rated player for discard, why would you ever choose the one with the lower rating? Once again this can give you a significant advantage over other investors.
 
Formation Required
Always know the risks. Sometimes we see formations with fullbacks or wingers and due to the lack of availability their prices can rise above other positions. The question I ask however, is why take the risk? Centre backs and Midfielders are always needed and hence a much safer option, you remove another element of risk. Goalkeepers and strikers can often flood the market, these should be a secondary choice here.
 
Availability Of Cards On The Market
Do these cards flood the market? Are we likely to see any sort of price movement in the build up to the event? These questions are always important as it can determine or profit levels. Ideally we want to look at teams or cards that have a more limited supply line. The reason for this is that as the event gets closer and people start preparing, supply dries up and hence prices rise, hype kicks in. This is where we can make money without the SBC even being released.
 
Hype
This year hype is back and it's stronger than ever! If we have done the research and picked our investments correctly, we should be able to sell our cards during the hype period leaving nothing to chance and hence not having to run the risk of waiting for the event to drop. Sometimes players won't rise to a level we expect, in these situations there is no shame on rolling the dice as long as you are always aware of what you are risking."
"FROM 0 TO 1,000,000 COINS - PART II",23-Jan-18 09:27,"15,000 - 75,000 coins

Right then, part two is here and we can finally start making some serious progress in this push to 1,000,000 Coins!
Assuming you followed part one, we will be sitting pretty on at least 15,000 coins and hence ready to undertake each and every challenge that lies ahead.

Squad Builder Challenges (SBC)
Squad builder challenges were a new feature introduced to FUT last year. The premise behind these is that players are exchanged for a reward, simple right? It is key to remember that any players we submit here, will be gone forever and are part of a direct swap for the reward offered.
Some general rules before we jump into these:
1. Always aim to pay as little as possible. This involves sniping, bidding and at times simply being patient to buy your players for a cheaper than average price.
2. Never buy price fixed or over priced players, there will always be a cheaper solution available.
3. If a challenge requires specific players that are inflated due to other reasons, simply make a note and come back to it at a later date.
4. While obtaining these players you may find that you are easily able to win bids or snipes at below market price. In this case you have found a fantastic, temporary trading filter! Make sure you use this to your advantage and abuse it to grow that coin total even more.
5. Some challenges require loyalty on players or can simply be made cheaper by obtaining it. Loyalty can be achieved by packing players or using them for 10 games. While simply  forfeiting matches or using the “dashboard method” works, we can use these teams to play matches and hence grow our coin total further.
6. While our coin balance remains fairly low, we need to ensure we are listing up everything that sells from any reward packs. Use FUTBIN to quickly check for their current market price and save yourselves some time.
Let’s Get Started
This is the first SBC we will undertake, and while the rewards are non-tradable and rather dull, we must complete this in order to move on.
The SBC is made up of three parts and is designed to be completed using the players we received at the start. Simply fill in the spots using the starting squad you received, claim your rewards and open the packs. This will unlock full access to the other challenges and allow us to continue through the guide.
League and Nation Hybrid
Now that we have access to the slightly more complex challenges, the first one we will turn our attention to is this. The SBC consists of four parts, each providing a reward that ensures profit, and just in case this wasn’t enough, we are also offered a cool 12,000 coins for completing all four!
Hybrid Master - Rare Players Pack
The first part we want to look at is the fourth and final challenge, “Hybrid Master”. This challenge requires a team with chemistry that is impossible without loyalty (players that have either played 10 games for your club or ones that were packed by yourself). Not only will we be building this squad for the challenge, but we will also be playing 10 games with them to achieve the chemistry we require.
Now when we buy a player, 90% of the time they will be fresh and hence come with just 7 contracts available. Remember all of that BPM we did in part one, well the contracts we obtained there are going to come into fantastic use now, allowing us to boost each of these players up to the magical 10 contract mark.
In-between playing these games, we need to ensure that we are keeping on top of our transfer list, removing sold items and re-listing others. We also want to ensure that we continue to apply coin boosts if available and use the BPM whenever space or coins allow. If fitness ever becomes an issue, we can always play against the AI on a reduced difficulty or use another method to finish off the remaining games.
After this short grind we should have recovered a large portion of our coins spent and also have the required loyalty, allowing us to submit the squad and receive the reward. Hopefully we get some insane luck, but the reality is that we won’t, simply list everything up and get ready for the next SBC.
Tough - Mega Pack
We now move into the third challenge in this group and luckily for us it follows a very similar pattern to the first, we need loyalty. Now I know this part is rather tedious and playing so many games can really drag, however the additional coins we earn from games and continuous BPM will really give us a boost going forward. If you really can’t stand the thought of more games with these teams though, feel free to simply forfeit the games required or use the dashboard method for the loyalty. Either way, we should have more than enough bronze contracts to once again ensure each player has a total of 10.
Whichever method you choose, soon enough we will have the required loyalty and hence be able to submit the squad for the reward. Once again ensure that you are listing everything up and replenishing that coin total once more.
Intermediate - Rare Gold Pack & 1,500 Coins
Right, that’s the majority of the hard work out of the way and finally we come across some challenges that can easily be done without loyalty. Simply complete this challenge, sniping and bidding to reduce costs, submit and open the pack. Once again remember to list everything up.

The Puzzler - Premium Gold Players Pack
The final part of this SBC is luckily the easiest. Same logic as above, complete for as cheap as possible, open the pack and list the contents. 
Even if you have had the worst luck possible we should still be in a little profit and either way, the 12,000 coins we now receive for completing all four ensures that we are comfortably in profit overall.
Hybrid Leagues & Hybrid Nations
We now move into the other two challenges that fall under the “advanced” category in the SBC section. Once again both these challenges consist of four parts each and in order to complete a couple, loyalty is ideal. To start with we will be looking at the final part of each challenge and how we can group them together to save some time.
National Pride & Squad Goals - 1 Mega Pack Each
We should now have more than enough coins to complete both of these challenges without breaking a sweat. The bonus here, is that while they may require loyalty, they definitely won’t need loyalty on each and every player. By working out how much each challenge requires, we can build ourselves a squad consisting of a mixture of the two teams and gain the required loyalty in just 10 games instead of 20. Once again, playing these games will give us a fantastic coin boost and if you have been keeping up with your BPM, contracts shouldn’t be any kind of an issue.
When finished, simply submit both the squads and grab yourself both the mega packs. Same process as before here, list everything and get ready for the next part!

Remaining Challenges
The good news is we are completely finished with challenges that require loyalty. Finally we can power through some challenges and simply enjoy opening the packs. 
Hybrid Leagues
Rare Fives - Jumbo Gold Pack
Seven Suspects - Jumbo Premium Gold Pack
Prime Nine - Prime Gold Players Pack
Group Reward - Rare Mega Pack
Hybrid Nations
Quads - Premium Gold Players Pack
The Six - Premium Gold Pack
It Takes Eight - Prime Gold Players Pack
Group Reward - Rare Mega Pack
Open the packs, list up what you can with the space you have and send the rest to the club for now. Ensure that you are replacing items on your transfer list when space opens up until we have eventually listed everything that sells!

Achieving Our Goal
Between playing matches, opening bronze packs and completing this set of challenges, we should comfortably be pushing that 75,000 coin mark. It may seem unrealistic, it may sound impossible, but if you have been careful, smart and patient, then there is no reason we shouldn’t be closer to 100,000 by now!
While trading and SBC’s can offer a huge amount of coins, simple things like coin management is what really makes the difference. Utilising the bronze contracts, using teams we needed for challenges to play games and making sure we list everything we open in these packs is what really separates us from the majority of the player-base.
If you complete this guide with time to spare, keep utilising the BPM and if you need a team to play some more games, simply buy players for discard, use them until their fitness is gone and then list them again to regain any coins spent. Coin management at its finest!
For those of you who enjoy a visual aid while completing such a guide, I will also be releasing a YouTube video for each part, showing you that this can be achieved! They can all be found on my channel 👉 ImADuckQuack YouTube channel"
Review - 2nd POTM Salah,13-Mar-18 06:29,"Mohammed Salah is continuing his sensational form for Liverpool this year earning himself his second Player of the Month card. He is winning the hearts of Premier League fans and FIFA fans alike, as we near the end of the 2017/18 season he is a valid contender for the Player of the Year, also some can argue he single handedly carried Egypt to their first World Cup since 1990. At the moment (knock on wood), Mohammed can do no wrong, but should you complete the expensive SBC required to get your hands on the Egyptian Messi?

To get a feel for his new card I completed the loan SBC to receive his card for 20 games. I wanted to be able to give a proper review so I competed a Division 1 run from scratch, I used him in the right-wing position in the 4-3-3(4) formation. I applied the “Marksman” chemistry style to him, you can give him the Hawk or Hunter chemistry style but I feel that they would be poorly utilized considering he already has 98 Pace. He was used in the following team:

 
FIRST IMPRESSIONS
At first glance the stat that sticks out the most is his blistering Pace; 97 Acceleration and 97 Sprint Speed should allow him to breeze by almost every wing back in the game. 99 Attacking Position and 99 Finishing means he will get into dangerous positions and he will finish his chances. His dribbling seems comparable to the likes of Neymar and Messi with very good Agility, Balance, and Ball Control.
After seeing these stats, I was very excited to see how they would translate onto the pitch, below I am going to give my review on each of the six major attributes on a scale from 1-5:

 
PACE
As the saying goes, numbers don’t lie. His 98 Pace allowed me to easily breeze through the midfield and past the fastest wing backs in the game. This allowed me to easily get the ball into my opponents final third to set up my attack, his Pace is by far his most valuable attribute.
Rating: 5/5


SHOOTING
Being a winger, it was important that Mohammed would be clinical in front of goal. With his astounding 99 Finishing and 89 Shot Power he was able to put away a majority of the chances he was given, using either a low driven shot with his left foot or a finesse shot from outside the box with his left almost always granted a goal. His 99 Attacking Position truly stand out as well, his runs were phenomenal, there were a few goals that solely came down to Mohammed for making a clever run in behind the defense. The only downside with his shooting is his 2-star weak foot. I tried to stray away from using his right foot but whenever I had to the shots did not have enough power or they were inaccurate. As long as you can keep the shots on the left foot you will be rewarded.
Rating: 4/5


PASSING
I’m not asking my wingers or forwards to make Luka Modric or Kevin De Bruyne defense-splitting caliber passes, the only passing I did with Mohammed was moving the ball around in the final third or sending a sitter across the box for my striker to slot in the net. He excelled with this type of passing, his 87 Crossing and 95 Short Passing helped make my attack more fluid and up-tempo. If you choose to play him in more a midfield role his passing flaws may show up, but for me he did what had to be done.
Rating: 4/5


DRIBBLING
Mohammed’s dribbling is on an entirely new level, his combination of 95 Agility, 92 Balance, and 96 Ball Control allow him to dribble in the tightest of areas and maneuver around some the best defenders in the game such as Rio Ferdinand, Jerome Boateng, and Eric Bailly. After I completed my Division 1 run I had 10 games left with him, his performance during those 10 games gained him my trust and I used him as a half-time sub for my remaining Weekend League games. This is when I realized that not only is Mohammed Salah’s second POTM card good, he can hold his own against the best teams in the most competitive environment.
Rating: 5/5


DEFENDING
There isn’t much to say in this category, Mohammed has no defending duties being a winger. But with his Medium Work Rates he would occasionally come back and apply pressure to midfielders possessing the ball and win a rare tackle to gain possession back. This takes me back in saying I don’t think he would be a suitable midfielder if you are thinking about playing him there.
Rating: 2.5/5


PHYSICALITY
This is a tough attribute to form a solid opinion on, there were times where Mohammed would hold off strong center backs but other times smaller wing backs would muscle the ball off of him. 75 Strength seems quite high for a winger but because of his small frame the stat doesn’t seem justified. He also has 95 Stamina so you will not have to worry about him getting tired if you end up going into extra time. In the beginning of the review I said you could give him a Hawk or Hunter chemistry style but I think Mohammed benefits the most if you give him a Finisher or Marksman chemistry style. This gives him that much needed physical boost.
Rating: 3.5/5


FINAL SCORE
Rating: 4.3/5

Mohammed’s combination of Pace and Dribbling made him one of the deadliest attackers I used this year. His left foot is comparable to the likes of Messi and Robben, if you get a shot off with his left it is destined for the back of the net. If you have a counter attacking style, this card is a must own for your team. But this card is exclusive to those that complete the SBC, that takes us to the question how expensive is the SBC? The current cost to complete his SBC is almost 700k coins, half of that cost comes from the first step which requires you to exchange one of his many special cards. If you have his first POTM or one of his three inform cards (one of those being a Hero Card) you might want to consider completing this SBC. One more factor to take into consideration is how many more special cards he will receive? It’s almost a guarantee he will be included in the Premier League TOTS, last year the Premier League TOTS arrived on May 19th. If you don’t have the patience to wait 2 more grueling months then I would highly advise you to get this card!

"FROM 0 TO 1,000,000 COINS - PART III",30-Jan-18 17:32,"75,000 - 125,000 (+ 50,000 Weekly)
Hello again everybody and welcome back to part number three in our 0-1,000,000 coins guide! If you have been following along so far, you should comfortably be at around 75,000 coins and flying, however from this point onwards the work becomes that little bit harder. Stay with us though as once you nail a couple of these lower tier trading methods, everything will start falling into place!

Marquee Matchups (MM)
Like always, we will start with the absolute basics and work our way up from there.
What Is MM?
Marquee Matchups is a weekly SBC that EA release on a Tuesday. The challenge itself commonly consists of 4 parts, each providing an individual reward, as well as an additional prize for completing the set.
The SBC gets its name due to the nature of the challenges included. Each of the 4 parts revolve around a real life match taking place in the footballing world that week. The games are commonly picked due to carrying some sort of importance, for example:
Two top sides in the league.
A historic derby or rivalry between the clubs.
An important match between two clubs at the top of the table.
While these give us a solid foundation when making predictions, it is important to note that EA have been a lot more unpredictable this year and hence predicting correctly has consequently become tougher.
The formula for each challenge consists of an 11 player squad, needing X players from the clubs featured. If EA are feeling generous they could demand just 1 player from both clubs combined, while at other times we have seen them require 2 players from each featured club. Small factors like this can have a surprisingly large effect on just how profitable your investments turn out.

Why Can MM Be Profitable For Us?
Whenever a new SBC drops, a huge influx of players suddenly require the cards required in order to complete the challenge. While they may not always be profitable or worthwhile, one thing we can ensure is that demand will always start extremely high for these players.
Now depending on how people have invested and the actual requirements (how many players are needed), we find ourselves with either a very profitable or break even investment at worst. The likelihood is that we make profit on all investments if we sell quickly enough (before the market becomes saturated) and provided we correctly predict of course! Cards will be bought from the market faster than those who invested can list them and hence a small window of inflated prices is created almost every time.
Like we mention above, most of the time supply is greater than demand, which puts an invisible price cap on just how high prices can go. If there are enough cards available to meet everyone’s needs, listing your card above the market price is practically ensuring it doesn’t sell, this is something we commonly see with gold players, those who are frequently packed.
So what happens when demand outweighs supply? I’ll give you an example, one which will help you decide on whether selling at any given time is correct. 
Earlier in the year we saw an SBC from the A-League. Both sides were made up of just Bronze and Silver cards, immediately reducing the supply. On top of this, EA set the requirements to “2 players from team A and 2 players from team B”. As you can imagine, prices sky rocketed and they very quickly hit their price cap of 10,000 coins remaining there for almost the entire week. Demand was greater than supply and supply was never given a chance to catch up. Selling early here could lose you profit, holding was the correct decision.
Now just the other week we saw yet another game from the A-League feature in this SBC. Once again both teams were made up of mainly Bronze and Silver cards and hence everybody expected the same inflation of prices. These cards hit around 1,500-2,000 coins in the build up to the release and then extremely briefly hit around 6,000 coins upon release, before very quickly dropping back to less than 900 coins a piece. The difference this time, EA asked for “1 player from EITHER team A or team B”.
All of these cards are deemed as useless prior to the build up for these challenges, they are sold for discard. Learning when to buy and when to sell is what can make you your millions.

When Should We Invest In MM?
It’s only logical that the earlier you invest, the cheaper the prices are while the later you invest, the more inflated they become. The logic behind this is simple:
When you invest early you are simply buying cards with virtually no value. It is unlikely they are needed in another SBC or hold high demand on the market normally and hence usually sell for on or around their discard price.
Now, when you begin investing later and later, effectively you are still buying useless cards that have no real value. You are buying into a theory, you are buying hope, hope that these cards will be required and hence turn you a profit. The difference here is that you are no longer paying their discard price and hence removing risk, now you are paying the premium price that other investors have set. You are buying other peoples investments, you are what gives them their profits.
Hype is a major market mover within any form of investments, if you can get in early enough then you will be selling on hype, instantly removing that need to roll the dice as you are already securing a profit prior to the SBC even dropping.
To summarise, get in early enough so that prices are still at their typical market value, but not so early that you simply clog up transfer spaces.

What Makes A Good MM Investment?
The most important thing to remember is that just because you value something at X price, it doesn’t mean others do too. For example, a lot of older cars hold a premium price tag due to the rarity of them in this day and age. While some people would happily pay that premium price, personally I would much rather spend my money on a new car, complete with warranty, guarantees etc. People value things differently, and that’s absolutely fine!
Now just because I personally won’t be buying this old and expensive car, it doesn’t mean that thousands of others won’t either. It’s actually the sheer volume of others that desire this vehicle that pushes the price up so high, demand outweighs supply and people develop FOMO (fear of missing out).
This is the exact pattern that the majority of bronze/silver players follow. These packs are opened a lot less frequently than gold packs and hence supply is much lower, leaving them fetching that premium price tag if demand were to rise. As the event gets nearer, more and more people start attempting to prepare last minute, buying these cards for that premium price while those who got in early are laughing all the way to the bank.
Now the reason that this type of investment is so fantastic, simply relies on the fact that prices will rise whether or not the match in question is actually included. Investors can safely sell during the hype, hours before the SBC even lands.
Once in a while, those investments you sold in the hype will be required and they will hit maximum price. Please don’t get frustrated that you sold to early, instead remember every other time you sold in the hype and they weren’t included.
Teams that have a wide variety of gold players also carry a fantastic and unique investment opportunity. The supply is so wide for most of these cards, that it instantly becomes fairly simple to win them on bids or sniping for below their market value. Now when the SBC drops, if these cards aren’t needed, we are still making profit anyway!
I would always advise mixing investments between 2-4 different games, this gives you a much higher chance of success if you decide to hold but also allows you to have investments riding over if you sell a handful in the hype. Diversify and spread the risk.
Now while these next few tips may not make you rich, every tiny, little advantage we can create, is one that we will always happily take:
If you can buy an 80 rated and 76 rated both for discard, the higher rated card almost always carries more value.
Non-rare gold cards and rare gold cards will usually find themselves selling at the same price if an SBC requiring them drops. 99% of the time, the non-rare cards are cheaper and hence can generate us that extra profit.
Not all formations require fullbacks, while every formation requires a centre back. Basic logic like this can also help you get ahead, think outside the box.

When Do We Sell Our MM Investments?
Now this area has been covered throughout the sections above, however a summary can never hurt.
If you got in early and prices have risen to a nice and profitable level, sell up, remove the risk and get out.
If you invested late and you bought at a premium price, then you bought these players expecting them to make the SBC. If they don’t make it, aim to sell amongst all the other panic sellers and if they do, quickly work out a rough market value and offload accordingly.
If you bought early, have nice profit, but believe either prices will rise more in hype or the SBC will require these cards, then ensure you have sound reasoning alongside a backup plan if this fails.
Guaranteed profit will always outweigh potential profit. The traders that slowly fill their pot with small profits, will almost always achieve more than those that are constantly searching for their fortune at the end of the rainbow.

How Can We Make Coins After MM Is Released?
Ok so we made our investments, sold some on hype, sold some upon release, but either way the event is done and hence profit time is over, right?
Wrong. This could potentially be the biggest and best opportunity to make coins around MM this week!
After the event drops we suddenly see thousands of people scrambling to gather the cards required to complete the SBC. The majority of players don’t invest, the majority of players won’t prepare and hence sufficient demand will remain for these cards. The other bonus is that a large proportion of players won’t know or care about MM and therefore will continue to list these now expensive cards, for rock bottom prices. This is where round 2 of profit comes in, sniping and mass bidding on these cards. Luckily it won’t take you long, but it’s extremely important you put the effort in:
Which teams prices have risen the most? Is it certain positions only? 
Is it a certain nationality that bumps the price up? 
Have all players from the league risen? Have all players in a set position from the league risen? 
What about nationalities in that league? 
After answering some of these, we will find our potential targets for sniping or mass bidding, the last thing we will need to consider is the viability of these filters. We need to ensure that if mass bidding we have plenty of options to bid on, possibly a couple of filters we can rotate through to ensure maximum efficiency. While if sniping we want to ensure that we are constantly receiving results, now I don’t mean we have to be winning them all, but you want these cards to be appearing fairly frequently.
The key here is to not get greedy! If you are aiming for a couple of hundred coins profit on your filter, you will win plenty of cards that give you this small margin but you will also see all the others that yield a much higher return. The small profits add up quickly, never overlook this!"
How To Complete League SBC’s For A Profit!,17-Apr-18 12:03,"Right then fellow FUTBIN readers! Last week we created a new account, and within a single week (and minimal actual trading), we have managed to achieve the following:
SBC Quaresma (Super Lig)
SBC Gignac (Liga Bancomer MX)
SBC Casillas (Liga Nos)
SBC Promes (Russian League)
SBC Younes (Eredivisie)
SBC Moore (Championship)
SBC Cavani (Ligue 1)
SBC Al Soma (Dawry Jameel)
SBC Hamsik (Serie A)
SBC Giovinco (MLS)
SBC Thiago (Bundesliga)
SBC Cristiano (J League)
SBC Teodorczyk (Pro League)
Then we have done a chunk of the other big leagues too:
SBC De Bruyne (PL - 14/20)
SBC Griezmann (La Liga - 16/20)
Personally I found the four newer leagues were tough to complete for a break-even due to them being inflated still (PL/La Liga/Pro League/A-League), although as you can see we can do a large chunk of some comfortably. Also the Championship due to the sheer volume of teams is one you want to complete nearer the end.
Now before we jump into things, I want to clarify a few points to reassure people on how easy this is and just what exactly it involves.

No FIFA Points were spent.
The account was completely fresh, we had 0 coins to start with.
I found somebody to gift me the extra spots for transfer list/targets, this massively helped.
We packed one inform worth 30k and then nothing else that exceeded 15k (from what I remember).
On top of all of these League’s being completed, we also generated over 300,000 coins with awful pack-luck.

Ok, I think that summarises everything that needed clearing up, now onto the method, logic and reasoning behind everything.
 
The Logic Behind Everything
A lot of the community look at things on an individual basis, for example “X SBC costs Y amount and is impossible to profit”. While in a isolated scenario this may be correct, when you look at the bigger picture it all makes sense.
When you buy a house, very few people can afford to pay for this up-front. In order to make this manageable, payments are broken down into monthly chunks, known as a mortgage. This makes obtaining this high end premium item a reality rather than a pipe dream.
This exact logic is applied to these challenges, while an SBC that is mainly Silver players with lower rewards is unlikely to turn a profit individually, if you consider each of those packs an investment for each of the other League SBC’s (due to the players from these you will inevitably pack), then it all becomes a lot more manageable.
Look at things from an overall perspective, instead of a single SBC to SBC basis.
 
Starting Off
If you read nothing else in this guide, please read this and remember it. EVERYTHING SELLS!!! Whether it’s a Gold player that sells for 400 instead of discarding for 300, or a player fitness card, by discarding these you are effectively throwing away coins. Check FUTBIN for gold player prices and simply compare prices for bronze and silver, but please don’t discard items as you will just be burning coins!!!
So we obviously created a completely fresh account and with 0 coins available, we immediately jumped into some games to generate that initial boost. We played 4 seasons games, winning them all and hence collecting the division 10 title reward.
The coins from the matches, alongside those from winning the title were enough for us to jump into some BPM (Bronze Pack Method). 
Some teams are stupidly expensive and a bunch of coins can be saved by simply gaining loyalty on the players to fix Chemistry and allow for more out of position players. This is key and the dashboard method (starting a game vs AI and leaving) will make this quick, while contracts saved from BPM will ensure each player has 10 game contracts.
 
BPM – Bronze Pack Method
Now I cannot stress enough how important it is to rinse these packs. Yes it may be dull, yes it may be boring, but this builds the foundation of everything moving forward. We opened, at an estimate around 500-1000 of these packs, selling any consumables or players that aren’t featured in a league sbc and saving any duplicates.
It is extremely important you keep any player that features in a League SBC as this will massively reduce costs down the line.
If you find yourself making a loss while completing this, then don’t stress about it. We made an overall initial loss from these packs, without a doubt, however the players we saved covered this and some down the line.
 
Upgrade SBC’s
When I started off this account, the intention was to use the theory that you could open bronze packs, sell anything of value, and use the bronze players for the silver upgrade, then the silver players for the gold upgrade and then ultimately have a chunk of players at your disposal to complete the 82-85 SBC and ultimately the Icon SBC.
While this remains possible (if they re-release it), the grind simply proved to be far too time consuming, with a ridiculous amount of bronze packs needing to be opened. This is why we added our own spin on things, we still completed these upgrade challenges, however the players we received were going to be used for the League SBC’s if possible, with the rest going into the gold upgrade with the same logic.
Now while each individual SBC is unlikely to provide a player that you desperately need or that is extremely expensive, along the journey you will save thousands of coins from packing the odd player that will do exactly this.
BPM -> Keep League SBC Players -> recycle others in upgrade SBC
 
Profitable SBC’s
Right, now this is extremely important, this is where we can generate a whole heap of coins that will in turn provide us with the funds needed to complete the leagues.
By Profitable Challenges, we are mainly talking about the advanced SBC’s or individual challenges within the League’s that provide what would be considered a strong pack.
The logic behind this, is that we will be mainly submitting gold players, players that we will usually not be obtaining via other methods, while the packs provide both potential (in regards to packing somebody worth a chunk of coins) and also future potential (in regards to packing players that can be used to complete other League SBC’s).
Remember to keep any player from a league/challenge you are yet to complete!
This list: Profitable SBC List is currently slightly out-dated, with a few of these challenges having risen in price and a whole heap of challenges missing. I will look to update this shortly, however for now this should provide a strong foundation for you to begin with.
 
Creating A Shortlist Of Expensive Players
This was something that we didn’t do until around half way through the grind, however had we done this earlier, we could have saved even more coins.
Each league seems to have one, maybe two, incredibly inflated and expensive teams. This is usually down to a couple of positions being near extinct on the market, or just really expensive.
Completing a shortlist of these players, either through transfer targets or via a squad where you can monitor the concept players, allows you to simply return to this at intervals and search the market for either a card listed on bid or one listed under current market value. This proved extremely helpful and saved us a large chunk of coins in the process.
 
Finishing SBC’s
Soon enough you will find that you have completed the challenges that would be deemed as “profitable” and hence you will be ready to use these coins, alongside all the players you have packed in order to start completing some leagues.
Now the best starting point is always going to be the league that you have obtained the most players for. You are immediately less likely to pack a player you need in this league when compared to others (as there is a smaller % you don’t have) and the rewards from these will likely help you get a boost for completing the others.
Work your way through them and use FUTBIN as a base for price points. If you come across an inflated player, that isn’t normally quite as high, simply aim for a different solution or make a note and check the market for this player at a later date.
Most leagues will have a team that is incredibly expensive, you will not make profit of this team! Accept the coin loss but aim to complete it for as cheap as possible. Keep in mind that the coin reward for completing the league and the player will more than compensate you for this.
 
Future Potential
These League SBC’s as a whole provide an array of players that aren’t all playable. However it is key to remember that by completing one league, the packs and profits provided will allow you to complete others for cheaper.
On top of this, some of these players carry a huge rating, which will in turn allow you to complete other challenges, such as Icon SBC’s, for a cheaper overall cost.

TOTW22 Predictions,12-Feb-18 14:26,"Starting Eleven
Rico 
Sevilla were at home to Girona for their La Liga clash on the weekend and in a game of only one goal, they secured all 3 points at home. It wasn’t all smooth sailing however, it took a majestic display from their goalkeeper, Rico, to ensure a clean sheet was kept. With 6 saves including one from the spot, he takes the first spot in our predictions.
Rui 
Over to Italy now where Napoli destroyed Lazio 4-1. Goals were evenly spread across the team but with a strong defensive showing and a goal to his name, Rui is the player who gets our vote this week.
Chiellini
We remain in Italy for this next selection and as Juventus desperately try to overtake Napoli, they travel to Fiorentina for their Serie A game. During a 2-0 win, Chiellini is the man of the hour. A clean sheet and a goal should be enough to see him capture his first Inform of the year.
Nkoulou 
Torino were at home to Udinese for their weekend match and in a dominant performance they not only ensured a clean sheet but also managed to score twice to secure all the points. Nkoulou played a big part in this, solid at the back and also scored going forward too.
Tagliafico 
Ajax were on the road to Roda for their weekend fixture and in a game of 6 goals, it was the travellers who took all the points. The match ended 4-2, and while Tafliafico may not have kept a clean sheet, 2 assists and man of the match may just be enough to steal a spot in this TOTW.
Mina 
Valencia played hosts to Levante for their La Liga fixture and in a comfortable 3-1 victory there were plenty of performances worth talking about. Mina is the man who gets the nod here though, with a goal, an assist and a near flawless performance, hopefully this winger gets his first special card of the year.
Talisca 
Over to Turkey now where Besiktas destroyed Karabukspor 5-0. Talisca is once again the man we are talking about and with 2 goals and a near perfect performance, a third Inform could be on the cards.
De Bruyne 
Over to the Premier League now where an untouchable Manchester City were hosts to Leicester. Now it’s not unusual to see a City player feature in these predictions, but this week comes with the surprise of not one, but two nominations! First up is De Bruyne, 3 assists and a spectacular match overall would make him guaranteed on any other week, but unless we see two City players make the cut, he is likely to miss out.
Cervi 
Portugal is our next destination where Benfica we’re away to Portimonense. In a 3-1 victory for the visitors, one man really stood out and stole the show. Cervi hardly put a foot wrong all game and when we add two goals into the mix a second Inform seems highly likely.
Aguero 
Aguero, the second Manchester City player and the biggest certainty of an Inform this week. Scoring 4 goals in their 5-1 victory, Aguero has all but confirmed his third inform, alongside a possible player of the month in the same week.
Ronaldo 
Ronaldo hasn’t quite been up to his usual form so far this year, however 3 goals and an assist during a 5-2 victory over Real Sociedad could be the turning point. The cherry on the cake is his position, yes, a second striker Ronaldo could be on the cards!
 
Substitutes
Kirintili 
Konyaspor were away to Alanyaspor for their weekend fixture and although they won 2-1, one man played a critical role in obtaining the win. With over 30 shots at goal, 12 saves and a saved penalty kick to his name, Kirintili has to have secured an Inform this week.
Upamecano
Heading over to the Bundesliga next where RasenBallsport Leipzig best Augsburg 2-0. Strong performances are usually built from the back, which is exactly what happened here. A solid defensive display coupled with goal should be enough to see Upamecano secure an Inform.
Kainz 
Staying in Germany here where Werder Bremen played hosts to Wolfsburg. During a 3-1 victory for the Home side it was Kainz who stole the show. Two goals and an incredible performance from start to finish could just be enough.
Jahanbakhsh 
AZ Alkmaar were away to Twente for their weekend fixture and after an incredible display, they left as 4-0 winners. Jahanbakhsh is the man of the hour this time with 2 goals and an assist and has surely done enough to get his name into the TOTW.
Under 
Over to Italy now where Roma played hosts to a bottom of the table Benevento. The match provided 7 goals, 5 of which went in favour of the home side. During their 5-2 win, Under was the man who stole the show. With two goals and an assist, this guy has to make the grade.
Firmino 
Liverpool have really struggled with consistency this year and during an away trip to Southampton there were plenty of concerns as to how the match would pan out. Liverpool managed a 2-0 victory with Firmino scoring the first and assisting the second. Could this be enough for a third special card?
Jovetic 
Over to France now where Monaco were on the road to Angers. The match ended 4-0 to the visitors and while defensively Monaco were solid, Jovetic, with two goals, is the man who gets our nomination.
Mounie
Staying in the Premier League for this selection where nearly promoted Huddersfield were hosts to Bournemouth. With the relegation battle really heating up the home side desperately needed a win, and a win is exactly what they provided. Huddersfield won 4-1 with Mounie scoring twice and assisting a third, this just has to be enough.
Szalai 
Back to Germany now where Hoffenheim beat Mainz 4-2 during their Bundesliga fixture. Szalai was the star of the show, not only did he put in an incredible performance, but he also provided two of the goals as well.
Soares 
Back across to Portugal now where Porto were away to Chaves. During a 4-0 thrashing there were several stand out performances, however Soares is the man who gets our nomination. With 2 goals and a solid display from start to finish, hopefully he makes the cut.
Cutrone 
It seems like AC Milan are slowly starting to find their form this year and with their away fixture to SPAL ending in a 4-0 victory, it seems like things are really on the up. With two goals and a solid performance, Cutrone is the man who gets the nod this week.
Eisa 
Back across to England now where Cheltenham were hosts Port Vale. In an incredibly comfortable 5-1 victory it was Eisa who stole the show. Scoring three and ensuring a hat-trick could very well be enough to see this young man secure his first ever inform."
TOTW29 Predictions,02-Apr-18 15:36,"Starting Eleven
Sommer
Gladbach were on the road this weekend as they visited Mainz for their Bundesliga clash. The match was fairly even throughout, but the home side were the ones who piled on a little more pressure. Despite a total of 14 shots, with 5 on target, Sommer ensured a clean sheet was kept and that his side took a point from the game.
Raul 
Braga were hosts to Sporting for their clash this weekend and in an incredibly tight match, it was the hosts who took the points. Raul was solid at the back ensuring his side kept a clean sheet and was also the scorer of the only goal in the match.
Ivanovic 
Over to Russia next where Zenit were away to FC Ufa. The match itself was incredibly tight with just a single goal separating the two teams. Zenit left as 2-1 victors with Ivanovic the hero of the game. Not only did he score one of the goals, but also provided a goal line clearance to ensure his side took the three points.
Robertson 
Liverpool were away to Crystal Palace for their Saturday fixture and despite going a goal down they fought back to take all the points. Robertson was solid throughout, the goal conceded was from a penalty caused by the keeper while his defensive performance was solid. To top things off he also provided the assist for the winning goal, could this finally be his time?
Khedira 
Juventus were hosts to AC Milan in the Serie A and with both sides needing the points, a heated match was on the cards. Juventus were simply fantastic when they got going and despite Dybala’s incredible performance another Inform for a goal and assist is just too much to ask. Khedira however is yet to receive an Inform and after his goal and assist, his time may be here.
Alli 
Tottenham were away to Chelsea for their Premier League fixture this weekend and as the battle for Champions League spots really starts to heat up, both sides needed the points here. Chelsea stuck first however the celebrations didn’t last long, Tottenham ended up as 3-1 winners and Alli was the man behind two of those goals.
Sanchez 
Manchester United were hosts to an Inform Swansea and after their shock exit from the Champions League they needed to bounce back. Sanchez was finally on form for United, scoring once and assisting a second in a 2-0 win. Now while this isn’t usually enough for another Inform, I feel that we may see him just sneak in. The big worry would be Lukaku who scored twice for Belgium on Tuesday on top of his goal against Swansea.
Perisic 
Inter Milan were hosts to Verona and in a dominant performance they locked up the points in a 3-0 win. Now while Icardi scored twice, Perisic was the man of the match, scoring once and assisting the other two.
Ibrahimovic 
LA Galaxy were hosts to LAFC for their MLS derby on the weekend and with the visitors leading 3-1 in the 71st minute things were looking bleak. Everyone changed when the Swedish hero entered the match, the game ended 4-3 to the hosts and Ibrahimovic scored twice on his debut to hopefully secure himself an inform as well!
Aubameyang
After recent criticism Arsenal were desperate to string a few wins together and prove people wrong and in their home game against Swansea, they did exactly this. Aubameyang was the first on the scoresheet, his second was from the spot and despite a chance to secure his first premier league hat-trick, he decided to pass the next penalty onto Lacazette which wrapped up their 3-0 win.
Lewandowski
We head over to Germany now for one of the biggest fixtures in the Bundesliga. Bayern were at home to Dortmund and while many expected a close game, it was Bayern who were runaway winners. In a sensational performance, Bayern were 6-0 winners and while we had several incredible performances, Lewandowski bagged himself a hat-trick and surely he has finally done enough to receive his second Inform.
 
Substitutes
Kose 
Kasimpasa were away to Goztepe for their Sunday clash and despite the visitors taking the points in a 2-0 win, things were far from easy. The home team wrecked up a total of 25 shots with 8 on target but no matter what they attempted, Kose was not going to concede today.
Joao Mario 
West Ham were at home to Southampton for their game and both sides were desperately after the points as the relegation battle heats up. Despite all the issues off the pitch, West Ham put in a performance to please everyone. While Arnautovic was the man of the hour he already has an Inform this week, Joao Mario however was also fantastic and with a goal to his name we could see his OTW receive an upgrade.
Alberto 
Lazio were at home to Benevento on Saturday and in an 8 goal thriller, a rollercoaster of events unfolded. Benevento went down to 10 men in just the 7th minute and then somehow fought on to take a 2-1 lead. Lazio equalised on the 60th minute and things snowballed from here with the match ending 6-2. Alberto scored once from the spot, assisted another two and dominated the game from the midfield.
Toornstra
Over to the Eredivisie now where Feyenoord played hosts to Excelsior. It was one way traffic from start to finish with the hosts dominating throughout. The game ended 5-0 and while 3 players secured both a goal and an assist, Toornstra from the midfield gets our nod here.
Cabella 
Saint-Etienne were away for their Ligue 1 fixture and this time the journey was definitely worthwhile. The visitors left as 3-0 winners and while there were some fantastic performances, Cabella was the man who stole the show. Cabella played a part in all three goals, scoring two, assisting the third and securing a near perfect match rating too.
Payet 
Marseille were away to Dijon for the only Ligue 1 game on Saturday. The match ended 3-1 to the guests with the goals spread across the front three. Payet was in great form and despite missing a penalty, he converted another from the spot and also provided an assist.
Plea 
Nice were away to Troyes on Sunday and it was the visitors who dominated. Nice win the game 2-0 and Plea from the left wing was sensational. Scoring twice and securing a near perfect match rating, he slides straight into our predictions this week.
Sio 
Montpellier were away to Caen for their Sunday match and in a game of four goals, it was the visitors who took three of them. The match ended 3-1 with Sio playing a part in each goal. Scoring twice and assisting the third should be enough to see him secure his spot this week.
Badji 
Colorado played hosts to Philadelphia for their MLS clash on Sunday and sadly for the visitors, Badji was simply unstoppable. In a 3-0 win for the hosts he scored each and every goal, securing the three points and hopefully his spot in this week’s team too.
Osawe 
Over to the second tier in German football now where Kaiserslautern were away to Duisburg. The game provided us with 5 goals, 4 of which went in favour of the visitors. Osawe was the man of the hour, scoring not once, not twice, but three times to finish his hat-trick and hopefully secure his spot in this week’s team.
Pires 
Portimonense were hosts to Moreirense for their Liga Nos fixture and in an end to end match, it was the hosts who just managed to edge the win. In the 89th minute the match was 11v11 and the visitors had a 2-3 lead. After the final whistle it was the hosts who lead 4-3 and the visitors had just 8 players left on the pitch. Pires was the hero, wrapping up his hat-trick in the 94th minute with his second goal from the spot.
Uth 
Hoffenheim were at home to F.C Cologne for their Bundesliga fixture and in an incredible performance they scored all the goals in a 6-0 victory. Uth was absolutely unstoppable, scoring twice and assisting another two to secure a perfect rating and surely an Inform too.

MARQUEE MATCHUPS,23-Nov-17 14:03,"Napoli vs Juventus
For the first selection, we find ourselves heading over to Italy where top of the table Napoli play host to the travelling Juventus. Recent trends suggest that any two sides within the top half of the league could be included within the selections, so a match involving both first and third place sides has to be noticed, right? The stature of these teams leaves us with few options for investments, it's going to be gold and ideally, we want the best rated yet lowest cost cards available. 

Porto vs Benfica 
Next up we have Porto against Benfica in a derby match known only as O'Classico (The Classic). Jumping back to Wikipedia as usual, this rivalry is based around the wealth, location and size of the clubs. With one from Lisbon and one from Porto (I wonder which is which), the question isn't who will be dominant during their fixture, the question is will this match feature in MM? Investing is once again simple, we are looking at the best rated players, in the strongest positions, for the cheapest possible price, simple! 
 
Birmingham vs Wolves
In one of the West Midland Derby's, we see Championship sides Birmingham and Wolves go head to head. Now unlike the games before, these teams aren’t full of gold cards to choose from which will usually see a significant rise in demand for silver cards IF this game were to be chosen. My advice here is aim for discard, if that’s gold fantastic, silver is great and if you're really late, just stick to bronze. There is no need to pile on unnecessary risk. 
 
Toronto vs Columbus 
We saw this match feature last week in the predictions and as the second leg of this MLS playoff game quickly approaches, we see it feature once more. The key reason I prefer this over the over playoff match is due to the rivalry between the two sides. The Trillium Cup is an annual event fueled by rivalry between both sides, this is practically the definition of a marquee matchup, right? Gold cards here are again scarce, so investing early is key. Don’t be afraid to pick up silver or even bronze cards however if prices inflate, avoid buying other people's investments! 

 
Besiktas vs Galatasaray 
Next up we move across to the Super Lig where we find first place Galatasaray travel to Besiktas in this Istanbul derby of sorts. If I remember correctly, we haven't seen this league feature too recently and when we couple this with such a big match it instantly becomes one I am hopeful of. Luckily, investments are nice and easy once again. Both teams have plenty of gold cards available, just make sure you consider which ones have the highest potential profit! 

 
Al Hilal vs Al Ahil
The final pick this week sees us travel across the Saudi League, where first place Al Ahli travel to second place Al Hilal. Once again, the game isn't a derby so to speak, but we do have the top two clubs in the league going head to head, which is a concept EA seem to favor this year. Investments here are fairly limiting once again with a distinct lack of gold players available. Discard silvers and if not, bronzes should once more be the preferred investment route here. 
 
Honorable Mentions
 
Arsenal vs Man United 
Possible, but a third week in a row with two top tier PL teams seems unlikely to me. 

 
Bournemouth vs Southampton 
 
Similar logic as above, another PL game would make it three in a row, however if that curveball is to be thrown maybe EA will choose something unexpected like this. 
 
Chievo Verona vs Hellas Verona
While an actual derby (Derby Della Scala), the fact that this is a cup match makes me a little wary of selecting it. Whether you agree or disagree with my logic, I wouldn't completely rule this one out though!"
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,22-Mar-18 17:37,"Last week we pulled off what I use to believe was impossible, four predictions, with four correct results. Looking back, we got pretty lucky, EA simply decided to include the four biggest international matches taking place this week and we were smart enough to include them. 
Its back to business now though, we have a whole heap of leagues back in action and a whole heap of possible outcomes to delve into and discuss. So, let's not waste any more time and get to what you all came here for! 
 
Chelsea vs Tottenham
First up this week we head over to England where we find two clubs who are desperate to qualify for Champions League football next year. Tottenham currently hold the fourth and final spot for this, while Chelsea are hot on their heels in fifth place. While this may not be a derby, games of this magnitude definitely qualify for the marquee title and therefore has every chance of making the cut. Investments here are simple, gold, strong rating and sensible positions! 

Juventus vs AC Milan
Over to Italy now where we find yet another game featuring two top sides in the league. Leaders Juventus play hosts to sixth place AC Milan and once again the stakes are incredibly high for both sides. A loss for Juventus could see Napoli overtake them atop the league, while a loss for AC Milan would really hurt their late push for Champions League football next year. Investments follow the same pattern as above, just be smart and aim for discard! 

Sevilla vs Barcelona
Spain is next and once again we are taking a look at two of the bigger teams in the league. League leaders Barcelona are away to sixth place Sevilla and while they may be comfortable atop the table, the extra three points is something they won't be looking to turn down! Investments here are the same as before, the bonus with this one however is that it ties in with a possible league SBC as well! 

Strasbourg vs Metz
France is the next stop on this magical mystery tour and this time we find ourselves with a genuine derby, not just two huge teams. According to the translated French Wikipedia page, this rivalry dates back years, focuses around the two clubs from the city of Metz and is known as the Eastern Derby. Now while we have some gold players available, once again we just want to be aiming for discard prices, so if golds aren't there, buy silvers and if not silvers, its bronze! 

Young Boys vs Basel
Young Boys seem to have already run away with the division this year, sitting on 61 points they are 16 points clear of second place Basel who have just 45 as it stands. Now once again, these guys are the bigger teams within the league and hence we have a variety of gold players to choose from. The bonus this time round is that they will all likely be floating at or around discard value and hence we should have no problems with picking up players if we choose this match! 

Feyenoord vs Excelsior
Over in the Eredivisie we have fourth place Feyenoord playing hosts to eleventh place Excelsior, but this time we find ourselves with a match that carries a little more significance. The derby between these two sides is known as the ""Rotterdam Derby"" and consists of any two clubs from the Rotterdam area (Feyenoord, Excelsior and Sparta Rotterdam). Investments again should have enough gold players, at least for Feyenoord, if you are struggling though then don't be afraid to turn your attention to other rarities here. 

Pohang Steelers vs Ulsan Hyundai
Next up we move across to Korea where we find Pohang Steelers and Ulsan Hyundai going head to head in a match known as the ""Donghaean Derby"". The derby carries its weight due to both clubs being located in the North Gyeongsang Province in South Korea and while this match seems a little more ""out there"", these are the types of games that can carry a little more hype when the event draws closer. Investments should be targeted at silver players ideally, however if we see these prices begin to rise, buying bronze players for discard is definitely the correct move. 

LA Galaxy vs LAFC
Finally, we head over to America where we find the battle of LA Galaxy and LAFC, the two sides based around Las Angeles. This is another one of those matches that is sure to generate a nice amount of hype and hence price increases nearer to the release simply due to the lack of gold players across the board. With that being said, there are gold players and if we can buy them for close to discard that should be our approach, however once again turning to silver players or even bronze, should still ensure a return on investment."
TOTW9 Predictions,14-Nov-17 14:10,"Starting Eleven
Pickford 
England were hosts to Germany in their International friendly and due to solid defensive showings from both sides the game ended 0-0. Pickford was impressive with 4 big saves and a clean sheet overall.
Alba 
Spain were hosts to Costa Rica for their friendly and a dominate performance secured a comfortable 5-0 win. Alba was the first name on the scoresheet and with a clean sheet on top, it just might be enough in this lacklustre week.
Benatia 
Morocco travelled to Ivory Coast for their World Cup Qualifying game, and a big performance could see them qualified. Benatia was ready, scoring the second in a 2-0 victory and keeping a clean sheet.
Marcelo 
Brazil were away to Japan for their friendly and everybody expected the same outcome. Brazil delivered, cruising to a 3-1 victory. Marcelo scored the second with an absolute screamer of a goal and while usually this wouldn't be enough, this week, well who knows.
Rodriguez 
Northern Ireland played Switzerland over two legs in their World Cup qualifying playoffs and thanks to a single goal from Rodriguez, it was Switzerland who progress. With 2 clean sheets and a goal from the spot, hopefully he has done enough.
Joao Mario 
Portugal were hosts to Saudi Arabia in their friendly and left as comfortable 3-0 winners. Joao Mario scored the third goal of the game in a solid performance from midfield, including him here is a bit of a stretch, but we are surely going to see some surprises.
Silva 
Another standout player in Spain's friendly was David Silva. With 2 goals and an assist in their 5-0 win, it could be time for his second inform already.
Forsberg 
Sweden were hosts to Italy in the first leg of their World Cup playoff, and due to a solid performance from the team they left as 1-0 winners. Forsberg was the standout player for Sweden, the question that remains is can they do the same again tonight?
Mkhitaryan 
Armenia were hosts to Belarus on Thursday and after a dominating show they left as 4-1 victors. With goals spread evenly across 4 players and the lack of options elsewhere, Mkhitaryan has as good a chance as anyone. He also scored from the spot today in a 3-2 victory over Cyprus!
Lukaku 
Belgium were hosts to Mexico on Friday and after fielding a weaker team managed only a 3-3 draw. Lukaku scored twice for Belgium in this game and once again, due to the lack of options, this could very well be enough.
Son
South Korea hosted Colombia for their friendly and it was the hosts who left as 2-1 victors. Son scored both goals for Korea and while some picks in these predictions are complete guesses, this one looks nailed on.
 
Substitutes
Lod 
Finland were 3-0 winners when they hosted Estonia for their friendly. Lod scored twice during this match, and again with the options we have this week, 2 goals feels like a lock.
Grozav 
Romania were hosts to Turkey for their friendly and Grozav was the star of the show. In a 2-0 win, he scored both goals ensuring Romania left as the victors.
Vrsaljko 
Croatia played Greece over two legs in their World Cup Playoff. A superb defensive performance in both legs ensured Croatia only conceded once, and with 2 assists in the first 4-1 victory as well, Vrsaljko really stands out.
Lozano 
From the same match that brought you the Lukaku prediction, we swap sides and find ourselves looking at Mexico. In a 3-3 draw against the odds, Lozano managed to strike twice and along with it broke into our predictions.
Sakho 
Senegal were away to South Africa in their World Cup Qualifier where luckily for them, the journey payed off. In a 2-0 victory that included an own goal, Sakho was the player who found the back of the net. Is one goal enough?
Anderson 
Lincoln travelled to Crewe for their League fixture this weekend and left as dominant 4-1 victors. Anderson scored twice in this performance and with it has hopefully done enough.
McGing 
Central Coast Mariners were hosts to Sydney FC in their league game on the weekend. In a convincing 2-0 victory, it was McGing from the back who both scored and ensured a clean sheet.
Grainger 
Carlisle were hosts to Yeovil this week and once again they were ready for the challenge. Emerging as 4-0 winners, it was Grainger who scored twice and put in a top performance to secure the points.
Camporese 
Foggia were 2-0 victors in their away game this week and a large reason for this was the dominant performance from their defender, Camporese. With a clean sheet and a goal, hopefully he has done enough to find a spot in the team of the week.
Pandev 
Macedonia were hosts to Norway and it was the hosts that provided the surprise win. In a 2-0 victory it was Pandev who scored the first and really gave them the momentum going forward.
Randolph 
In the first leg of this World Cup Qualifier, it was Ireland's goalkeeper Randolph who ensured the playing field remained even. Despite Denmarks best efforts a couple of fantastic saves kept them out and left everything to play for in the second leg tomorrow.
Robin Olsen
Sweden managed to qualify for World Cup after keeping the italiens away from scoring in the second play-off in Milan. Robin Olsen had several good saves towards the end of the match and played an important part in keeping the zero."
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,18-Oct-17 18:06,"We are back for yet another week of Marquee Matchup predictions, and after our fantastic success last week, finding all four matches, we aim to repeat this again!
When making any investments for these events, ensure you consider the nationality, rating, rarity, position, quantity available and most importantly price. Try to cover all formations, or potential requirements and aim to spend as close to discard as possible.
Finally remember that we don't need these to happen to make profit, selling on hype the day or morning before release can often guarantee a strong financial return!
Panathinaikos vs Olympiacos 
First up today we have a hate driven fixture between two of Greeks largest clubs known only as the derby of eternal enemies. Apparently Olympiacos use to represent the working class, while Panathinaikos the upper class, today however they both represent the investors class and hopefully it will pay off!
AC Milan vs Juventus 
Both teams have started the season a lot slower than they perhaps would of liked, which makes this match all that much more important. Juventus currently sit in 3rd, while AC Milan are bang in the middle of the table in 10th. While not strictly a derby, the lack of Serie A fixtures recently coupled with the size of both teams, leaves this with a strong possibility of showing up.
Boavista vs Porto 
Two clubs are in the city, Porto the large, widely supported team and Boavista, much smaller in size and supporters. The derby is know as Derby Da Invicta, and while it looks like one team has the upper hand, expect a fast and furious match, full of surprises!
Zenit vs Lokomotiv 
Over to the Russian league for this one, a league that we haven't seen feature in marquee matchups for quite a while. First place Zenit play host to second place Lokomotiv and while this isn't a derby by name, the winner of the match will claim the top spot for themselves. The Russian league SBC has already inflated prices, so be careful either your investments.
Guadalajara vs Atlas 
One of the oldest derbies in Mexico sees Guadalajara play host to Atlas in El Clasico Tapatio. Lucky from an investors point of view the cards are all close to discard as it stands and hence plenty of valuable options are ready and waiting for us!
Brighton vs Southampton 
We haven't seen the premier League feature in marquee matchups for a few weeks, and hence a return becomes more and more likely with each passing week. We have a few games to choose from, which will be mentioned below, but today I'm opting for the curveball, the south coast Derby. We have plenty of discard options available for this match, but unless your confident with your PL pick, it sure looks like safer options are available elsewhere.
Birmingham vs Aston Villa 
Over to the championship for this game and we see Birmingham take on Aston Villa in a heated match. If we hadn't seen Ipswich vs Norwich feature last week, I would be a lot more comfortable in suggesting this, however as it stands it doesn't jump to the top of my predictions.
Hibernian FC vs Hearts 
The final choice for this week, and my personal favourite, sees us traveling to Scotland for the Edinburgh Derby. Both clubs sit on equal points meaning the winner will jump ahead, and with a distinct lack of gold cards on the market hype alone should see that investors make a strong profit.
Honourable Mentions
Manchester United vs Tottenham Hotspur
Crystal Palace vs West Ham
Stuttgart vs Freiburg
Al Nasser vs Al Hilal
Austria Wien vs Rapid Wien"
FUT FM Episode 47,20-Apr-18 04:54,"Hey comrades, fan favorite Air Japes is back on FUT FM! He’s here to tell us what it was like to be the commentator for the eMLS Cup, one of the most successful FIFA esports competitions so far.
We also take a look at how auto switch move assistance continues to improve our game. Let’s jump in!
 

 
Auto Switching Move Assistance Is… Awesome?

For a few weeks now the FUT FM gang has been playing around with auto switch move assistance.
This option can be found in your controller settings in FIFA 18. If enabled, it means that your players will take a few steps in the direction they were already reading towards prior to the switch.
In theory, you would expect this to add more delay to your game. But as we and r/SeriousFIFA have discovered lately, defending actually feels way more responsive when the assistance is set to low.
We’re not really sure why, but on low it seems that our defenders are more agile and tend to magnetize to the ball more often. One theory is that the options are mislabeled, and low might mean “off.”
Of course, this is a wild theory, but in the past we’ve seen custom tactics get switched around by accident as well.
Either way, we encourage you to try setting auto switching move assistance to low! Let us know how it affects your gameplay, we’d love to hear your thoughts.
 
Behind The Scenes At The eMLS Cup
 

 
With the eMLS Cup now over, Air Japes joined us to talk about what the event was like as a commentator.
He was initially in talks with a team to be a player at this event, and this led to him landing a commentating role.
Basically, being a commentator requires a whole lot of preparation! He had access to everyone’s teams ahead of time and watched every match possible in order to prepare for the live shows.
Japes brought his A game and even had to commentate on multiple matches at one time. He helped make the entire event super lively and was able to feed off the PAX crowd. Speaking of which, it was amazing to see non FIFA fans walk by the cup and immediately become invested in the action.
To hear more about Japes’ behind the scenes experience and favorite moments, tune in to the full episode at the top.

TOTW4 Predictions,10-Oct-17 10:09,"With international features taking over this week, picking a TOTW became a lot more difficult. With OTW cards having left packs, EA will be looking for a bumper squad in order to boost pack sales again, but just how incredible can they realistically make it without forcing players in?
Lewandowski - ST
Poland played twice over the past week and if anybody was going to be driving home the goals it was this guy. Once again he provided, with a hatrick in the first and one from the penalty spot in the second.
Murphy - ST
Ireland had everything to do going into these final two games and the odds were stacked against them when it came to making the WC playoffs. However Murphy bagged himself two goals in the first game against Moldova and then Ireland finished off the job against Wales last night.
Carrasco - LM
On paper it looks like Belgium should be destroying Bosnia whenever, wherever but their away match proved a little more difficult that most would expect. Squeezing out a 3-4 win against the hosts secured the points once again and with a goal and an assist Carrasco is the man who stands out.
Goretzka - CM
With a 3-1 win against Northern Ireland earlier in the week, Germany almost doubled the goals with a 5-1 win over Azerbaijan. Although most players put in a solid performance, Goretzka was the stand out player with 2 goals here.
 
Matuidi - CM
France faced a difficult away game to Bulgaria, a team with a near perfect home record in qualifying. The game was separated by a single goal early into the game from Matuidi and while usually this may not be enough, a goal from a defensive minded midfielder has often made the cut especially when it's a big name that sells packs.
 
Salah - LM
A win here for Egypt guaranteed qualification with a game to spare. With a 2-1 win over Congo, they achieved this and have brought Egypt back to the WC. Salah was the star performer here, and although one was a penalty, bagging himself two goals in such an important game has to be enough.
 
Pulisic - RM
With a 4-0 win over Panama, there has to be a USA player in this TOTW. While Altidore scored 2, Pulisic was the stand out star. With a goal, assist and a man of the match performance he ticks all the boxes a team of the week performance requires.
 
Zuber - LM
With a massive 5-2 over Hungary, Switzerland showed nothing but dominance once again. The usual LWB Zuber took the role of LM for his country, and he took it with some class. Bagging himself 2 goals in the victory is surely enough to secure his spot.
 
Granqvist - CB
Sweden faced Luxembourg over the weekend and a top performance was required. Sweden decided to go one step further, with a modest 8-0 win. While Berg scored 4 of these goals he sadly doesn't feature in UT, and if we couple this with the lack of defensive options available, Granqvist kept a clean sheet and scored two from the spot. This has to be enough right?
 
Arnason - CB
With 2 games remaining Iceland needed two huge performances, and younger they delivered! A 3-0 win away to Turkey was the first and when we consider the 75% possession the hosts had, this makes the defensive play all that more impressive. Arnason not only kept a clean sheet at the back, but also bagged himself a goal.
 
Halldorsson - GK
There was a real lack of goalkeepers to choose from this week, and although we have a CB featuring from this exact match, leaving this guy out was just too hard. A clean sheet and dominance at the back across two games, can often stem from the keeper and the way they shut down Turkey especially deserves recognition.
 
Thiago - CM
Spain hosted Albania earlier in the week, and with a total of 28 shots, they picked up a 3-0 win. With Isco in the current TOTW and Pedro scoring once as a striker, Thiago who picked up the third is the most likely candidate. A few big names always make the team, the question is did Thiago do enough?
 
Sigurdsson - CAM
Iceland have done it! With Croatia dropping points against Finland, Iceland found themselves simply needing a win to top the group. Now while we already have a few Icelandic players included, a goal and an assist from this OTW player is surely enough, provided Monday games are included in this weeks team of course.
 
Kramaric - ST
After a draw against Finland Croatia found themselves needing points against Ukraine to even make the playoffs. Luckily they delivered, with a 2-0 win Kramaric was the hero who provided both. The only uncertainty again is around do Monday games count?
 
Novak - LB
Czech Republic picked up two wins in their matches, with the second being a 5-0 win over San Marino. Although the result was to be expected, a clean sheet and a goal from a defender feels like it should be enough to make the cut this week.
 
Boutaib - ST
Morocco were hosts to Gabon in their qualifier this week. A solid 3-0 performance and a hatrick for the lone striker should prove more than enough to secure him a spot this week.
 
Whiteman - CM
Moving away from the international scene, Doncaster hosted Southend United, and with a solid 4-1 performance they picked up the points. From a CM role, Whiteman bagged himself a hatrick and with it a place in these predictions.
 
Harrison - ST
Bristol Rovers travelled to Northampton for their weekend fixture. The journey was well worth it, wig a dominating performance and a 6-0 win over the hosts. Harrison at striker managed to score twice in the match which is hopefully enough to land himself his first inform of the season.
 
Embarba - RM
We move over to the Spanish league now, and Rayo Vallecano were the hosts to Valladolid. A dominate performance saw them win comfortably at 4-1, Embarba scoring himself two from the RM position.
 
Caputo - ST
Over to the Italian leagues now, and Empoli were hosts to Foggia. A comfortable 3-1 win saw the hosts cruise to victory and with 2 goals Caputo was the standout player.
 
Castiglia - CM
Pro Vercelli travelled to Perugia in this Serie B match, and left as comfortable 5-1 winners. From a midfield role Castiglia put in a dominating performance and also bagged himself two of the goals. 
 
Elyounoussi - RM
Norway travelled to San Marino for their WC qualifier this week and left as very comfortable victors with an 8-0 win. While players like King had a great game, Elyounoussi got the match ball with a hatrick and has to be in contention for a TOTW slot too.
 
Scevopic - ST
Sporting Gijon were hosts to Sevilla II over in the Segunda Division this weekend. In a comfortable 3-0 win, the striker scored two of the goals and has hopefully done enough to bag himself a spot here."
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,13-Oct-17 17:52,"Last week's Marquee Matchups saw some surprises with both the matches included and those left out. Luckily we still had most bases covered and managed to pick 3/4 games, which isn't too bad! 
This week we see a weekend packed with big fixtures, fierce derbies and ultimately plenty of choices. We aren't going to list every game here, instead we are going to take a look at a select through and provide some reasoning as to why we prefer these choices.
 
Marseille vs PSG
First up we have a big Ligue 1 game between the league leaders PSG and third place Marseille. Le Classique is one of the biggest derbies in French football and with no Ligue 1 games recently in MM, it has to have a great chance.
 
Galatasaray vs Fenerbahce
Next up we move across to Turkey and the Super Lig. League leaders Galatasaray play host to seventh place Fenerbahce. The intercontinental derby is one known across the globe between two of the biggest clubs in the league. Once again with plenty of discard value cards available, the risk is minimal here.
 
Feyenoord vs Ajax
Over to the Eredivisie now and we see second place Feyenoord taking on sixth place Ajax. This derby goes by the name of De Klassieker and once again is one of the biggest in the league. With so many options it's hard to pinpoint the best choices, but we haven't seen a game from here included yet and cards are discard as it stands, good enough for me.
 
CSKA Moscow vs Zenit
Flying across to Russia and we see fourth place CSKA Moscow play host to league leaders Zenit. While it may not be a derby per say, it remains a massive game in the league between two of the top sides. Once again, we are yet to see this league feature in MM, could this be the time?
 
Austria Wien vs Rapid Wien
Moving on to the Austrian league and we find a fierce derby between third and fourth place, Austria Wien and Rapid Wien. The Wiener derby (or Vienna derby according to Wikipedia) isn't anywhere nearly as big as some of the others we looked at. The big bonus here though is the fact that cards are discard, bronze or silver and there is a chance we repeat last week's Melbourne price increases. Games like these are always worth a small gamble right?
 
Kaizer Chiefs vs Orlando Pirates
Next up we have a big derby on a smaller scale. The Kaizer Chiefs take on the Orlando Pirates in the Soweto derby. On FIFA these are the only two teams that appear from the league, so it makes investing extremely simple. Once again though, it's a smaller game and EA won't include them all, but is this the one that deserves our attention?
 
Portland Timbers vs Vancouver Whitecaps
Our final game selection takes place in the Western Conference part of MLS and it sees league leaders Vancouver Whitecaps play host to third place Portland Timbers. We are yet to see a game from the MLS feature in MM, and with their season drawing to a close, time is running short. That's one of the key reasons I like this derby for the outside punt, players are still discard and we have nothing to lose!
 
Honourable Mentions
While the above games are the ones I'm naming in my predictions, it's important to at least list the other potential matches. 
Tottenham vs Liverpool
Valencia vs Sevilla
Ipswich vs Norwich
Napoli vs Inter Milan
D.C United vs NY Red Bulls
 
As always, these are only predictions and with EA being so surprising this year we can be certain of nothing. These games however are the ones I feel have a better shot at making the cut. Also spreading the risk across multiple matches is always advised and greatly increases your chances of getting at least one right.
Remember, that while waiting for the release of MM can drive big profits, cashing out during hype is always the safer and hence smarter route to take. If you do choose to hold, and we have a repeat of the Melbourne Derby though, well it's gonna be a good day!"
FUT FM Episode 53,03-Jun-18 05:58,"Hey comrades, the World Cup update is officially here, we’ve crowned an Xbox playoffs champion, AND 94 TOTS Jonas (our favorite FUT player) is out. What a week! Let’s get to it.
 

 
P.S. We now do a bonus unfiltered and uncut episode every week. Once you finish this one and the article, be sure to tune into the first FUT FM RAW at the bottom of this page.
 
There’s A Problem With Custom Tactics, And A Solution

After testing custom tactics between ourselves and with helpful friends on Twitter and Reddit, we have come to the conclusion that custom tactics do not always apply to your team.
Goran (drpoplove) ran 76 79 49 as his defensive CTs for 11 games in the World Cup mode, but his team would simply drop deep and not press. Only after he touched the CTs mid-match did they start to apply.
So the best way to make sure that your custom tactics are being used is to set them up as you normally would, start a match, pause, select your CT and change any value by 1 (you can then change it back).
If you’d like to test this yourself, hop into an online match and try playing with 25 25 25 as your defensive CTs vs 76 79 49. Compare the 2 with and without mid-game changes.
EA have been notified of this issue and are looking into it, here’s a tweet from Zaro:
 

Thanks for the heads-up, Goran! 👊❤️
We got that and sent it to the teams right away!
Will keep you updated! (o;
— Mr. Zaro (@EA_GZaro) May 31, 2018
 
As of this writing, we’re not sure if this affects core FUT as well. To be safe, we recommend re-applying your CTs in all modes mid-game.
 
Early Reactions To The World Cup Mode

Both of us are enjoying our World Cup time so far, despite the obvious bugs and glitches (scoreboard, offside, etc.).
It feels like this mode is really meant for casual enjoyment, which is a nice change of pace. Packs give you decent pulls, and getting an Icon is super easy! So far, we’ve seen a lot more variety in the teams we’re facing, but that’s to be expected early on.
Of course, this update has absolutely annihilated the FUT market! Prices have hit rock bottom and continue to drop. Some have critiqued this as “killing the game,” but at this point we’re in June 2018.
The next FIFA is roughly 3 months away when you actually think about it, so why not let people have a little bit of fun? Not everyone can play 1000+ matches to grind for the cards they really want, plus there are no more qualifying FUT Champs months.
Enjoyment aside, the custom tactics bug is critical. Also, it would have been really nice to been able to play online FUT WC friendlies.
On another note, we want to give a huge congrats to Michael “Megabit” Bittner for winning the Amsterdam playoffs! He’s a great player and has been known to go 80-0 (both consoles) during the WL Crazy!
So that brings us to FUT FM Raw! If you’ve made it this far you’ll want to tune into our bonus episode, we dig deeper into the World Cup, the playoffs, and GDPR!

MARQUEE MATCHUPS,08-Nov-17 19:00,"Arsenal vs Tottenham

The first game in this week features is in the Premier League and we have a huge London Derby between Arsenal and Tottenham. With both clubs full of such quality, we are going to be looking at gold players here, but luckily we still have plenty of discard options available. Take into account possible rating of the challenge alongside which players will be in higher demand.
 
Atletico Madrid vs Real Madrid
Our second game sees another huge fixture in La Liga with the Madrid derby. Investment opportunities here are plentiful and with one team having a more limited selection, we could also see a larger increase in prices (if bought at discard of course). The only concern I have here, is that Atletico vs Barcelona has recently been featured. This could persuade EA to wait for the reverse fixture of this derby before including it.
Yeovil vs Swindon
We move back to England for this fixture and with another Marquee Matchup prediction, we have yet another choice from the lower English Divisions. Local rivals Yeovil face Swindon in this heated match and with the distinct absence of gold players for both teams, discard silver players could prove to be extremely profitable here.
 
Gornik Zabrze vs Legia Warsaw
This ones a little different as we head over to the Polish league next. Top of the table Zabrze are hosts to Levi's Warsaw in this fixture, where the winner will jump into the lead. While not a derby, the magnitude of this game from within a smaller league is nothing to ignore. Plenty of discard investments available.
 
Panathinaikos vs AEK
In the Greek Superleague we find another match that carries significance between Panathinaikos and AEK. According to Wikipedia, both teams are located in the Athen metropolitan area, one from the port and one from the suburbs and this is where the derby originates from.
 
Monterrey vs Tigres
Clasico Regiomontano is the name given to the derby between these two Mexican, crosstown rivals. As one of the largest and most well known derbies in Mexican football, this surely has a chance to feature in the upcoming weeks challenges and with plenty of players available for discard still, we are spoilt for investment choices.
 
Nacional vs Medellin
Once again we refer back to Wikipedia for some information on this Columbian derby.  Atletico Nacional and Independiente Medellin share the Atanasio Girardot stadium and is widely known as one of the fiercest rivalries in Columbian football. The name given to this match is El Clasico Paisa and with the wide availability of discard players once again, we have options flowing this week.
 
Roma vs Lazio
Once again we have a handful of strong fixtures scattered across the Serie A and with this plenty of potential candidates for the SBC. The concern I have here, is that we have seen a few games recently selected from this league, including one only last week. Could EA pick another fixture from here or does it need a little breathing room first?"
TOTW12 Predictions,04-Dec-17 17:45,"Starting Eleven
De Gea 
Manchester United travelled to Arsenal for their League fixture, and if they wanted to keep the pressure on league leaders Manchester City, a win was required. Thanks to 14 incredible saves from De Gea, they achieved exactly this and pulled off a 3-1 victory. Is it too early for a SIF De Gea or is it simply irrelevant after such a strong showing.
Filipe Luis 
Atletico were at home to Real Sociedad for this La Liga fixture and thanks to a strong defensive showing and a goal from their LB, Luis, they ensured that they took all the points.
Rudiger 
Chelsea played Swansea in their first league game this week and despite the hosts being strong favourites, the game was anything but easy. The deadlock was broken by a single goal from Rudiger, and when we also add the clean sheet into the equation, hopefully he has done enough.
Thesker 
Twente were hosts to Ajax for this Eredivisie game and if I’m honest there were plenty of stand out performances. With the lack of standout defensive performances this week though, with 2 goals in a 3-3 draw, Thesker makes these predictions.
Skriniar 
The first of two players to feature from Inter Milan’s weekend game is their CB, Skriniar. Ensuring a clean sheet was kept and also picking up one of the five goals, might just be enough in a week where defensive masterclasses weren’t flowing.
Coman 
With so many games played this week it is always difficult for an attacker to break into the lineup with a single goal. Bayern were 3-1 victors over Hannover in their Bundesliga game and although Coman only scored once, he was by far the best player on the pitch and truly deserves this recognition.
Ozil 
Despite a tough loss against United in their second fixture this week, Arsenal absolutely destroyed Huddersfield 5-0 in their first. Ozil was absolutely everywhere on the pitch, scoring once and assisting another two. The only worry is that the United match may go against him.
Coutinho 
As a Liverpool fan it is fantastic to see them back on track, but when it comes to selecting the TOTW it provides a bit of a nightmare. Salah scored twice midweek, Firmino got two on the weekend, but for me, Coutinho with his goal and 2 assists stole the show.
Rooney 
Finally under new management and it seems like Everton could have finally turned a corner. In the week, Everton destroyed struggling West Ham 4-0 with Rooney scoring three, including one from his own half. This guy is a lock.
Perisic 
From the hat-trick Rooney scored straight into another from Perisic. Inter were hosts to Chievo on Sunday and in a dominant 5-0 thrashing, Perisic is clearly the pick with a breathtaking 3 goals.
Giuliano 
The final player making the starting lineup also sees our second path to glory card. Fenerbahce were hosts to Kasimpasa in their weekend game and in a 4-2 victory it was Giuliano who stood out. Scoring twice and dominating the match, he has wasn’t his spot in these predictions.
 
Substitutes
Brignoli 
We have seen numerous superstars feature so far in these predictions, but this pick is by far my favourite. Newly promoted Benevento were at home to AC Milan and despite being almost 25% through the season, they were yet to secure a single point. It took a last minute diving header from their goalkeeper to achieve this feat and if this isn’t team of the week worthy, then I may as well give up!
Igboun 
FC Ufa were hosts to Amkar in their Russian League fixture and once again it was the home team who took all the points. In a 3-0 victory, it was their striker who not only scored twice but also assisted the third.
Savic 
Lazio travelled to Sampdoria for their Serie A fixture and despite their great form this season, an easy win wasn’t to be. Lazio managed to edge out a 2-1 victory mainly thanks to a fantastic performance from Savic who dominated the pitch and also bagged himself a goal.
Gnabry 
Hoffenheim were hosts to Leipzig for their Bundesliga clash and it was the Home team again who stole the show. In a 4-0 thrashing Gnabry was the standout player, scoring twice and creating numerous problems for the oppositions backline.
Bruin 
Seattle were hosts to Houston for their MLS playoff match and in a comfortable 3-0 victory Seattle make the finals. Bruin was the star of this match scoring once and assisting on another.
Da Costa 
Strasbourg were hosts to an unbeaten PSG for this Ligue 1 fixture and it was a match that seemingly had only one outcome. Despite the odds, the home team managed to overturn the league leaders, securing the three points and providing PSG with their first loss of the season. Costa was the star of this performance, scoring once and assisting the second.
Natcho 
CSKA Moscow were hosts to Tosno for this Russian League fixture and to say that both teams showed up would be a lie. In a 6-0 thrashing there were numerous great performances, but their CDM Natcho really stood out. Locking down the midfield, scoring once and even providing an assist, he is my player of choice from this match.
Casteels 
In a typical team of the week we will see just the two goalkeepers included, but with the amount of incredible displays this week even keeping it to 3 was a struggle! Wolfsburg were hosts to Monchengladbach in this Bundesliga match and although the scoreline reads 3-0, the match was anything but easy for the hosts. The away team had an incredible 17 shots but Casteels ensures that not a single one slipped past him, keeping a clean sheet and earning a spot here.
Lingard 
We come across our second Manchester United player now and while some may suggest Young deserves this spot, Lingard just steals it for me. Scoring once midweek and then twice against Arsenal, hopefully this youngster has done enough to earn his first Inform this year.
Swierczok 
Zaglebie Lubin were hosts to Termalica in this weekend fixture and in a 4-2 victory there was one man who stole the show. Scoring 3 goals within just 9 minutes, Swierczok not only secured a hat-trick, but also a spot in these predictions.
Edouard 
Celtic were hosts to Motherwell for their SPL fixture and as you may expect, the hosts were dominant once more. In a 5-1 victory it was their striker Edouard who takes the glory, bagging himself a hatrick and a deserved selection here.
Tavernier 
It’s not often we see a SPL player feature in the team of the week, and to see two is almost unheard of, however this week it feels justified. Rangers were hosts to Aberdeen for their fixture and in a 3-0 win, it was their RB, Tavernier, who not only kept a clean sheet, but also scored twice."
"FROM 0 TO 1,000,000 COINS - PART V",15-Feb-18 18:49,"225,000 – 400,000
If this is the first guide you are seeing, make sure you jump back to part one and work your way through the rest! While some of the content may not directly apply, every little bit offers advice and knowledge that may simply improve or solidify what you already know. To ensure you stay up to date with new releases and trading information too, ensure you follow both myself (@ImADuckQuackk) and FUTBIN (@FUTBIN) on Twitter!
Ok then guys, so we should be sitting comfortably on at least 225,000 coins as it stands, (well if you have been keeping on top of the various methods and repeating your Marquee Matchup investments you will most likely be closer to 300,000), but for the purpose of these guides we will assume the latter. At this point we are moving into the realms of larger money trading and a whole heap of options that were previously non-viable suddenly become an appealing option for us going forward. This episode of the guide however will attempt to keep things nice and simple still, we will be looking once again at repeat events, events that can provide a reliable source of income time after time.
 
Player Of The Month (POTM)
Once again, let's start with the basics. The POTM award drops every month and is based around real life footballing events. As it stands EA only create challenges for the Premier League with the winner being directly linked to the real-life winner of the award. The SBC usually consists of 2-4 parts and offers a POTM version of the players card with increased stats across the board. There is a public vote that counts for a nominal percentage of the voting, while the board come together to ultimately decide on the overall winner.
 
Investing in this follows a similar path to that of Marquee Matchups, it involves a lot of guess work and your safest option is to always sell on hype. This works in our favor, we have experience trading in such a manner and hence we should feel fairly comfortable making both buying and selling decisions here.
 
Deciding On The Possible Winner
What would define an incredible month for the average football fan, may not be exactly what the general public and judges tend to look for when deciding upon the winner. If you were to look back on previous winners of this award, you would realize the sheer lack of both defenders and goalkeepers listed. Obviously sometimes attacking players simply are more deserving, however a lot of the time goals and assists simply speak louder than clean sheets. Unless a defender or goalkeeper has an incredible month, then we should be targeting players with goals/assists to their name.
Another important factor to keep in mind is the overall performance of the team. If somebody is scoring but the team is dropping points constantly, their overall impact instantly becomes a lot less effective than a similar situation where the team is winning. Creating a shortlist after each weekly game can become incredibly helpful as it allows you to stay ahead of the market and react more effectively to change.
 
Predicting the Possible Challenges
This is where it becomes extremely difficult when dealing with your POTM investments as EA have a tendency to deliver unexpected challenges. In the past we have seen several concepts repeat themselves, these would often be described as the safer, more predictable investments and include: 
Players/Special cards from the same nationality as the winner
Players/Special cards from the same club as the winner.
Players/Special cards from the same league as the winner.
Players/Special cards from the same previous clubs as the winner.
Player/Special cards of the winner.
 
These types of investments are ones that the majority of people will immediately think of and hence if we are buying them early enough, it opens a huge window of hype in which we can sell them. We also have the option of thinking completely outside the box and attempting to guess requirements that nobody else will be looking at. The bonus of taking this approach is that profit margins will likely be incredible if you guess correctly, however we are removing the opportunity to sell on hype and also avoiding a much safer predictable investment in order to carry this out.
 
We also need to consider the possible rating of the player along with an estimated cost of the challenge. Now I'm not suggesting we need to know exactly how much this challenge could cost but having a guideline could massively help us shape our investments. For example; if Eden Hazard were to win, we can safely assume that the team ratings will not be 83 and lower consisting of perhaps an inform or two. Just like if Peter Crouch were to win, we aren't going to expect an 87-rated squad consisting of an 88 inform as well. Obvious factors such as these allow us to price up our investments while helping us understand where we may envisage them selling at in the future.
 
Selling Investments
Now we have previously touched on this subject but covering it in a little more depth can't hurt. Like with every investment we make we have two options; we either sell during the hype or we hold until the event. Now while both hold their own merits in certain situations, selling during the windows of hype is almost always the correct decision. Selling on hype removes the element of risk, we don't need to wait and see if our investments are included, we don't need to compete with everybody else panic selling if we were wrong, we simply offload for a profit and re-invest in the next venture.
 
So, when does it become the correct, or at least an acceptable decision to favor holding opposed to selling in the hype? If your investments still have potential to grow, however have hardly moved up until this point, holding is usually an acceptable option. Some basic math will allow you to determine your current position, ask yourself; what will this card sell for if it isn't needed and hence what is my potential loss vs what will this card sell for If needed and hence what is my potential gain? If this is a risk you are willing to take then feel free to roll those dice, however always make sure you fully understand that by doing so you are potentially throwing away any profit you worked so hard to achieve.  
 
League SBCs
League SBCs were a new addition to FIFA last year and one that went down extremely well with the player-base. The SBC presents individual challenges for each and every team in the league, usually requiring a full team of 11 players for each and every club. The formations and rating requirements differ between each club, as do the rewards you receive for completing each individual challenge. Upon completing each team in the league, players are rewarded with a premium card of a certain player alongside the coin rewards. When we combine the multiple pack rewards, the coin bonus and the SBC player obtained, we quickly realize why players simply love completing these types of challenges.
 
Preparing In Advance
Now with most investments we need to put aside time to research, time to understand the market, time to estimate when may be the cheapest period to buy and also time to consider when the best time to sell may be. Now with League SBC investments we barely need to even lift a finger, the work is practically all done for us already. We know what the requirements are going to be (11 players from each club), we know roughly what the rating will be (when pre-building the clubs it becomes fairly easy to guess), we can also prepare in advance for any random formation EA choose to throw at us (we can buy extra players to cover all angles) and finally we don't necessarily need transfer list space (we can store one of each player in the club). So, with all of these positives going in our favor, what exactly is stopping us from investing here?
 
Firstly, let's talk about what we should be spending. Obviously as time goes on and the bigger leagues draw closer, prices tend to start rising for those cards that are a little rarer (bronzes and silvers for positions that have fewer options). If we buy players such as these, we are simply buying other people's investments and potentially overpaying, this is what we want to be avoiding at all costs. These players may carry a higher price due to anticipation, but I can guarantee you that hardly anybody is paying attention to them in the grand scheme of things. Bidding and sniping work a treat here, if a player feels overpriced, simply bid on a large quantity, continue about your day, and then rinse and repeat this process, you will win one eventually. The same logic is applicable for gold players; however, we have the additional bonus here of the massive supply available. Bidding and sniping once again is critical if we are planning on maximizing our profit, we want to be paying as close to discard for each and every player.
 
Now let's discuss what exactly we should be buying during this early preparation period. Personally, I invested in leagues a while back. I built each team in a 4-4-2 formation and then bought an additional midfielder and center-back to cover almost every formation. This allowed me to complete the SBC (not advisable if we are aiming to maximize profit) and also gave me a couple of extra players that could be sold to recoup a large percentage of what I initially paid back. If you have the patience and the coins are aren't needed for a month or two, I would advise picking up one of each player available, paying around discard for each. If the challenge is released and you decide you would like to complete it, you still have a wide selection of extras available to be sold, allowing you to effectively complete the challenge for a profit. If the challenge is released and you decide it's sell time, you have a whole heap of cards available, covering all formations and rating requirements and are in a fantastic position to make a small fortune.
 
To give you a rough example of just how profitable investing in these can be:
Bundesliga Investment Cost: 50,000-75,000 Coins.
Bundesliga Current Cost: 340,000 Coins.
Bundesliga Bayern challenge requires 3 86 rated players at a cost of 90k. We would have unlikely invested in these.
Bundesliga Adapted Cost: 250,000 Coins.
Bundesliga Profit (Assuming we ONLY had 11 players per club): 175,000-200,000 Coins.
These calculations around a week after the challenge dropped. If we are selling the gold players earlier and the silver players a little further down the line, we could be adding a large chunk onto these numbers as well.
 
Select Investments
Whether you decide to complete each and every team or not, this is a viable approach that offers the possibility of profits ranging from 10-50 times your initial investment. When the Serie A SBC dropped, Benevento CB's were extinct for weeks before EA finally increased their price ranges. When the Bundesliga dropped, Frankfurt wingers instantly became extinct and still remain this way as it stands. These are the types of players we are desperately trying to find and these are the kind of investments that can make us that million overnight.
The key here is all down to research. Which teams only have X players available for X slots and are therefore required? Which teams only have silver players in X position and are hence a lot rarer than others which have golds? Which teams play in a formation that require X players to even come close to obtaining the required chemistry? Questions such as these will shape your investments and allow you to make incredible profit. For obvious reasons I will not be listing future example within this guide (as it would simply cripple the market), however you have all the tools required to find these possible gems yourself!
 
Selling Investments
One of the most common questions I receive revolves around when to sell investments. Now obviously depending on the actual investment, the reason it was bought and the current trend of the market, this answer can wildly differ based on each scenario. Luckily for us however, these investments commonly follow the same exact pattern.
 
Gold Cards: Packs are constantly opened within FUT and the majority of these packs are those that contain gold players. When a new SBC drops we have an initial influx of demand for cards, a demand that can quickly eat through supply. In this state, packs aren't being opened fast enough to catch up with demand and as supply begins to dwindle, prices start to rise. Now obviously as time goes on more and more packs are opened and the prices of these gold players begin to drop, the key selling window for these cards is during the initial hype when everybody is attempting to buy from a limited pool of supply.
Keep in mind that certain gold cards may be required to complete an SBC, these will obviously hold their value and likely rise past this initial hype period. A prime example would be Spanish players from the Bundesliga which are a must for the new advanced SBC.
Silver Cards: Silver packs are opened a lot less than both gold and bronze and hence these cards carry a much more limited supply on the market. During the initial hype we see demand increase and a large quantity of these cards are snapped off the market. The difference between these players and the gold ones mentioned above is simply the rate in which they are replenished. As time goes by, if demand continues to outweigh the rate in which these players are packed and added to the market, prices will continuously rise. This is how we get to situations like the ones mentioned above where players actually, become extinct. Holding these players for a week or two will usually see a higher return in profits.
Keep in mind that while this may be the case for plenty of silver cards, some are simply useless due to the other options available. If a position has multiple cards available to fill the spot, then demand will be split amongst the group of cards. If one of these cards is of gold rarity, your investments are likely to rise alongside the initial hype and then drop back down. It is important that you are aware of such changes and make notes upon investing/selling.
 
Trading After Release
Just because the SBC has been released it doesn't mean that our investing and trading potential has gone, in fact we suddenly have an unlimited supply of potential that we can tap into as and when we please. Basic trading methods such as sniping, bidding or even mass bidding work an absolute treat around league SBCs and as you gain more confident and begin to learn rough prices, your knowledge only improves along with your profits.
Test different filters, find out which players sell for a nice chunk, which teams have the rarer cards, which positions are good to mass bid on, which rarity returns a higher profit – options are unlimited!
 
Conclusion
If you have been following along and repeating investments as and when applicable, then you shouldn't have any issues getting up towards this 400,000-coin mark. As we come towards the end of our SBC's and repeat event investments, this is where we are going to need commitment and dedication. While we have some methods to talk about that are extremely straight forward and simple, the majority of them will require more research and a stronger understanding of the market, which we can tackle and learn together!"
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,26-Oct-17 15:30,"Last year Marquee Matchups would commonly highlight the top games of the week, whether they were derbies or simply an important match, they had a chance at making the cut. With the release of FIFA 18, we have seen EA take a completely different approach. Yes, so of these games still make it, however we are starting to see more and more curveballs thrown into the mix, most likely in an attempt to stop people hoarding these cards and forcing a market drought with them. Whatever the reasoning behind the changes, we are seeing games included that really shouldn't be, and hence investing for the release of the event has become a lot harder. 
 
Of course, we can always believe in our choices and hold until the SBC drops, however this adds un-needed risk into the equation. The much safer option is to buy early enough, when the cards are at discard, and sell during the hype in the buildup to the release. Whichever method you choose however, we still need some predictions as to where we can invest, so without further ado, let's jump into these choices! 
 

Dortmund vs Bayern 
 
Der Klassiker is the first game up today and it features two giant teams from the Bundesliga. Dortmund currently sits atop the table, while after a shaky start, the favorites Bayern Munich are in hot pursuit.Der This match provides numerous options for investment in the form of gold cards, leaving bronze/silver investments fairly useless. If this game is included, the key will be working out the formation, rating and number of rare cards it requires. 


Manchester City vs Arsenal 
 
Moving onto the Premier League now, and this fixture contains nothing more than a big game between two clubs. While It receives a mention in this guide, I would be shocked if we saw it included as we already have Manchester United vs Tottenham within the current MM.  
 

Genoa vs Sampdoria 
 
Derby Della Lanterna (which according to Wikipedia means Derby of the Lantern and im really hoping there is an incredible backstory to this) is the Serie A pick of the week. Genoa in 16th place, are hosts to Sampdoria in 6th and with just six points from ten games, then need something here. This match provides a slightly stronger investment as the number of gold players each team has is a little more limited. That being said, there is still enough to cover what may be needed and hype is unlikely to move these players too much. 
 

ASSE vs Lyon
 
Once again, I am using Wikipedia for all my knowledge. The Derby Rhone-Alpes, Derby Rhonealpin or if you prefer, the simple name of Le Derby, all refer to this Ligue 1 fixture between ASSE and Lyon. Just like before we are spoilt for choice when it comes to gold players, meaning hype is less likely to rise these player prices. When you invest in these types of games though, if you are correct when it drops and it requires a handful of players, that’s when payday comes. 
 

Kobenhavn vs Brondby 
 
Over to Denmark now where we see Kobenhavn take on Brondby in the Copenhagen Derby (also known as the New Firm Derby). Now that we are playing with a system that can include any game within the SBC, this is the sort of match I love. There is just 1 gold player available across the two teams, meaning that all investments will be around silver/bronze players. If we are able to bid on these cards for around 150/200 coins a pop, selling on hype prior to the event should ensure a healthy profit. 
 

Basel vs Young Boys 
 
Over to Switzerland now, but we aren't going to spend too long talking about this match. F.Zurich vs Basel features in the current MM and personally I cannot imagine EA including back to back games from the Swiss Super League, expecially when Basel currently feature. 
 

Lokomotiv Moscow vs CSKA Moscow 
 
We move onto the Russian league with this fixture choice, and the fact that we are yet to see a game from here included excites me with this pick. Lokomotiv currently sit atop the table with CSKA only two places below them in third. We have plenty of options here with gold players again, so when choosing who you buy always consider rating, rarity and position. 
 

River Plate vs Boca Juniors 
 
Across the country to Argentina now where we see Buenos Aires rivals River Plate and Boca Juniors go head to head in this game known as Superclasico. These two teams don't have a wealth of gold players to choose from which leaves investment opportunities across the board. If this is the game you pick though, the few golds available at discard will be the strongest investment choices. 

 
Guadalajara vs Atlas 
 
The final game we are looking at today features in Mexico. We see Guadalajara play host to Atlas in a fixture known as Clasico Tapatio. While Guadalajara has a hanful of gold options available, when it comes to Atlas this isn't quite the case. We have plenty of potential with this matchup, the only question to ask is whether or not the game will be included. 

 
Honorable Mentions 
  
Bristol City vs Cardiff 
  
Anderlecht vs Club Brugge 
  
Rangers vs Partick"
The Weekend League Cycle,03-Oct-17 17:48,"What Is The Weekend League
A new addition to ultimate team last year, the weekend league provides a more competitive element to the game. Over the period of Friday to Sunday, players may complete up to 40 matches receiving rewards based on the amount of games won. There are no draws, so extra time and then penalties are always hiding around the corner.
On top of the weekly awards available, untradable monthly prizes are awarded based on the total number of wins across the whole month.

Why The Weekend League Effects The Market
Due to this competition being so competitive and every player attempting to achieve the highest number of wins possible (in order to receive the best prizes possible), there is a large uplift in demand for the premium players that fall into the appropriate price banding. While players like Ronaldo are in constant demand for obvious reasons, cheap beasts who are more affordable for the general player base see a much larger increase in demand. With extra players looking to buy simply the most overpowered cards possible, we can see dramatic price swings depending on who is in favour at any given time. At times the weekend league will provide specific requirements that must be met in order to play, for example 0 PL players in the squad. This can heavily effect the market as you can imagine as emphasis falls on certain leagues, nationalities or rarity of card.
With the weekend league taking place over the period of just 3 days a week, we also see a lot more action during this period in terms of people buying. Last minute preparation, lack of desire to play in the week or simply people changing players in order to try out others ensures that this is when the market is at its busiest.
 
When And Why People Buy
We touched on this above, but the key reasons people buy for this event is to; build the best possible team in order to achieve the best possible rewards, replacing players that simply aren't working for their specific play style, trying new cards or formations which require a change in the roster or simply matching set requirements that the weekend league may provide.
The average FIFA player tends to buy their team whenever they are ready to play. With most people working through the week this usually falls on a Friday evening which is why we often see a significant increase in prices. Those who follow the market closely will prepare in advance, buying when others are selling. This period is commonly just after the weekend league finishes.
 
When And Why People Sell
There are hundreds of reasons why people sell, well maybe hundreds is a slight exaggeration but there are still loads! Weekend league requirements, players not working for them, players not fitting into a set formation used, better cards becoming available or simply wanting to change things up are some prime examples.
Once again, with the majority of people just selling and buying when convenient for themselves, we see most people selling their teams as soon as they are finished with the weekend league so that they can have their coins readily available to build again in time for the next. This provides a large influx of cards on the market around the end of the weekend league alongside less people buying. Consequently we see prices being undercut in an attempt to sell and hence prices taking a dip.
 
Weekend League Rewards
Rewards are always an exiting time for the FIFA player base! The chance of packing that one big Premium player that could completely change your time is forever enticing, but how can this effect the market?
Rewards have been released at 18:00/ 19:00 GMT for the past 6 months (depending on our daylight saving nonsense). This is likely to continue going into FIFA 18 and hence gives us an indication of what to expect. Due to the fact that rewards are released to all players simultaneously, we constantly see a bajillion packs being opened at the same time which in turn provides a significant uplift in players entering the transfer market. This in turn leads to a large percentage of players undercutting one another in order to sell their cards quickly, temporarily bringing down the prices of a large number of players.
Monitoring and understanding the market here provides massive investment potential. Winning players for cheap on bids, sniping or whatever you plan on doing is possible and with the expected increase in demand coming on Friday you are usually able to quickly offload these players too for a swift profit.
Understanding demand here is the most important factor. Some players will take a price dip and then recover, due to demand, while others will take a dip and then remain at this new price simply due to the lack of demand.
 
Investing In The Market
If we base this off trends that repeated last year, we are left with a very simple guide on how to invest. Obviously this should be tweaked and improved as your knowledge grows and you react to any changes we see take place:
Buy when everyone is selling, usually as the league finishes or the days that follow.
Buy when player prices dip below their estimated value, usually when rewards are released and everyone attempts to sell at once.
Sell when everyone is buying, usually as the weekend league starts and people start creating new teams.
To summarise, buy when demand is low and sell when demand is high, simple!
 
Consumables
Let's not forget one of the biggest money makers during this event, consumables! With a large percentage of players attempting to win as many games as possible, we see a massive amount of players running a single team to ensure they are familiar with how they play, the strengths and weaknesses etc.
This provides a huge increase in demand for squad fitness cards and contracts which is rarely present during the period where weekend league is out of action. A squad fitness is ideally applied after every two games and a contract whenever needed. Based on this logic, an average player will apply 20 squad fitness cards per weekend league and when we multiply this by the amount of players doing this, a bucket load of these cards are used!
Use the same logic here! Buy when demand is low, outside of weekend league hours and sell when demand is high, during the weekend league.
As mentioned in other guides, special cards being released can provide an increase in demand for chemistry cards or position changes too. As your market knowledge improves, you will instinctively start picking up on trends with this and investing accordingly.
 
Investing In Yourself
With weekend league rewards being awarded in tiers, sometimes buying that premium player will allow you to progress to the next level. An investment such as this WILL lose you coins, even if it's only from EA tax, so when does this type of investment make sense?
If the Premium player will move you up from gold 3 to gold 2, it's debatable if the cost is worth the reward. However moving up from Silver to Gold, or Gold to Elite is a significant increase in expected reward value and often can be the correct decision.
Obviously this doesn't mean spend everything you have, but if you can justify spending X% of your coins for this boost, and the expected gain matches or surpasses the expected loss from the investment, it's always a decision worth taking advantage of."
TOTW17 Predictions,08-Jan-18 17:04,"Starting Eleven
Oblak 
Atletico were hosts to Getafe for their weekend fixture were they picked up a comfortable 2-0 victory. Oblak once again was in form, pulling off a total of 5 saves and ensuring a clean sheet was kept.
Bonucci 
AC Milan haven’t had the most successful season after their summer spending spree, and in a game at home to relegation battling Crotone, 3 points was a minimum ask. In a 1-0 victory, Bonucci was the man who separated the sides. With a clean sheet and a goal, we should see another OTW card receive a boost.
Koulibaly 
Staying in the Serie A for this second CB selection where we find Napoli play hosts to Verona. In a 2-0 victory, Koulibaly was the man who separated the sides. Keeping a clean sheet and also scoring once, hopefully we will see his first inform of the season.
Etxeita 
Athletic Bilbao were hosts to Alaves in their Sunday fixture, and in a comfortable 2-0 victory Etxeita was the man who stole the show. With a solid performance at the back and a goal to his name, we could very well see him feature this week.
Sessegnon 
Fulham were hosts to Ipswich for their Championship game and in a 4-1 masterclass they left with all the points. The star of the show was Sessegnon at right back, scoring twice and assisting another.
Obiang 
West Ham were away to Tottenham for their midweek fixture and in a 1-1 draw the match seemed to lack action across the board. Two absolute screamers were the only shots able to hit the back of the net, with Obiang’s being slightly more impressive.
Alba
Barcelona were at home to Levante on the weekend and in a comfortable 3-0 victory, finding a candidate for these predictions was anything but easy. With the lack of games this week and hence the time lack of big names, there is an outside chance we see someone sneak in. Suarez with a single goal and Messi with an inform so recently puts focus elsewhere and with a solid performance at the back, a clean sheet and an assist, Alba could very well be our man.
Falque 
Torino were hosts to Bologna for their Serie A fixture and in a dominating display, they left as 3-0 victors. Falque from the right was the real star, scoring once and assisting another.
Carroll 
West Ham were hosts to West Brom for their Tuesday night brawl, and three points were more than needed from the game. West Brom took an early 1 goal lead, but a little magic from Carroll endured the hosts took the points in a 2-1 win.
Immobile 
The man scored 4 goals at striker. We don’t need a story, we don’t need any other information, this guy is in the team of the week.
Bale 
Real Madrid were away to Celts Vigo for their La Liga clash, and in a game of 4 goals, neither team could secure all the points. While we don’t usually see such a big name receive an inform for a draw, the lack of options this week gives Bale a huge chance of making the cut. Two goals from the striker position, could we be seeing a striker Bale?
 
Substitutes
Matheus
Braga were away to Bovista for their midweek fixture and in a game of 4 goals, they were the team who left victorious in a 3-1 win. The game could have ended very differently if it wasn’t for their goalkeeper Matheus, pulling off a total of 5 saves including one from the spot.
Coda 
Benevento picked up their first ever Serie A win last week, and Coda made my predictions. It looks like he was equally as upset as myself to not receive an inform, so this week he simply gave EA no other option. In a 3-2 victory, Coda scored twice and assisted the third to see Benevento pick up back to back victories.
Dost 
Sporting were at home to Maritimo for their Sunday fixture in Liga nos, and in a dominating display they took all the points in a 5-0 victory. Once again it was Dost up front who stole the show, bagging himself another hat-trick and most likely another Inform too.
Marega 
Porto were at home to Vitoria De Guimaraes for their Sunday fixture and in a 6 goal thriller, they were the team that emerged victorious. Marega at RW was the shining star of the evening, scoring twice and ensuring Porto took all 3 points.
Villafanez 
Panathinaikos were at home to Platanias for their Greek Super League fixture on the weekend and in a 2-0 victory it was Villafanez who shone the brightest. Although both goals were scored from the spot, this week it could very well be enough to make the cut.
Castillo 
Pumas were away to Pachuca for this weekend fixture and in a 5 goal thriller it was the away team who managed to edge the win. In a 3-2 victory, it was Castillo who secured the points, scoring two of the three goals.
Novais 
Rio Ave were at home to Pacos De Ferreira for their Liga Nos clash, and in a 6 goal thriller it was the hosts who took the points. In a 4-2 victory, Novais at RW scored twice and secured the man of the match award too.
Ruiz 
Real Betis were away to Sevilla for their La Liga fixture on Saturday and in an 8 goal thriller, picking out a nomination for this team of the week was still a challenge. While defenders on both teams scored plenty, the amount of goals conceded puts me off those, so our choice is Ruiz at CM, who scored once and put in a solid performance.
Djalma 
PAOK were hosts to Levadiakos in their weekend fixture and in an incredible performance they left as 5-0 victors. Goals were split amongst 3 of the players, Djalma and Priijovic bagged two each, but seeing as one was from the spot for Priijovic, Djalma makes our selection.
Milivojevic 
Crystal Palace were away to Southampton for their Premier League fixture and with their relegation battle gearing up, a win was desperately needed once more. In a promising performance, a win was what they achieved and in a 2-1 victory, Milivojevic is the man who stood out. Holding down the midfield and scoring the winner could be enough to see him secure his spot.
Longridge 
Falkirk were hosts to Dundee United for this Scottish fixture and in a 6-1 masterclass, the hosts took all the points. Plenty of options for TOTW slots here; but our selection is Longridge, scoring two goals from the left.
Angel 
Eibar were away to Las Palmas for their weekend fixture and in a 2-1 victory for the travelling side there were a few solid performances. Angel at LB not only put in a solid defensive display, but also provided the assists for the winning goal too."
FUT FM EPISODE 52,28-May-18 05:00,"Hey comrades, the FIFA 18 World Cup update is just around the corner, so let’s take a look at some interesting ratings and how they may affect your squads!
 

 
 
A Major Downgrade To A Major Player… Or Is It?!
 


One of the best FIFA 18 all around central midfielders has gone from 86 to 81.
That’s right, Radja Nainggolan has been super nerfed. To be fair, he’s had a poor season and even our resident Roma fan (Valerio) will admit that fact any day of the week.
However, Nainggolan’s face attributes have only been reduced by a couple of points each, so the downgrade is not as bad as it first seems. He will likely still be a very solid CM option, and with the lower rating, you can expect to see him packed more often.
We recommend pairing him with a pacey midfielder though, since a lot of early teams will tend to focus on pace. Pace has traditionally been the lynchpin of the FIFA meta, and it’s even more popular in the early days of squad building.
With such a big pace focus, strength often gets overlooked. Buffing Nainggolan defensively will help turn him into an excellent box to box midfielder early on in the game.
 
The Samba Sweat Is Real

Ok, so every FIFA has some pacey Brazilian players, but get ready for a whole new level of sweat!
Fagner (77 RB) will have 84 pace, making him an easy early game pick for many squads.
Fred (81 CM) will have 81 pace, along with decent attributes in all other categories.
Taison (82 LW) will have 92 pace. Enough said.
Douglas Costa (83 LW) will have 93 pace.
Aaaaaand Giuliano (83 CAM) will have 82 pace.
If you pack any of these Brazilians -and the chances will be very decent- you’re looking at a huge advantage early on in the World Cup.
Whether you prefer to play centrally or on the wings, you’ll be able to string together explosive attacks and quick counter attacks with “average” players.
 
The Chemistry System Gives You More Options

In the FIFA 18 World Cup update, chemistry will be based on nationality and international federations.
This means that you can easily make multi nation hybrids using the 433 formation (which you can change in game if desired).
So if we think back to what the meta was at the start of FIFA 18 (hint: Bakayoko), we can already get a sense of what kind of squads will be effective early on.
Imagine a Brazil + France hybrid ;)
That’s it for this week comrades, thanks for checking out FUT FM 52. We’ll be back next week with much more on the World Cup, including the new icons!

TOTW11 Predictions,27-Nov-17 17:00,"Starting Eleven
Leno 
Our first pick this week sees us head over to the Bundesliga where Leverkusen we’re away to Frankfurt. In an incredibly tight match, it took a 76th minute winner to separate the sides however if it wasn’t for Leno, the day could have gone very differently.
Benatia 
Juventus hosted the struggling Crotone for their Sunday fixture and while a win was expected, you can never be too sure. Luckily on this occasion the hosts delivered. In a 3-0 victory, it was Benatia who stood out. A clean sheet and a goal would normally be enough, the worry is he only received his last special card 2 week’s ago.
Sane 
Hannover were hosts to Stuttgart in their Bundesliga fixture and in an extremely tight game, the match ended 1-1. A fantastic defensive performance from Sane secured the point, and if it wasn’t for the woodwork he could have also secured the win.
Ginter 
Gladbach were hosts to Bayern for their weekend fixture and when the league leaders turned up, they were ready. Edging out a 2-1 victory, Ginter at CB not only put in a solid performance, but scored the winning goal as well.
Mbaye 
Bologna were hosts to Sampdoria in this Serie A match and the visitors seemed far from prepared. In a comfortable 3-0 victory it was the right back Mbaye who really stood out. A clean sheet and a goal is hopefully enough to earn him a spot.
Keita 
Leipzig were hosts to Werder Bremen in their Bundesliga match, and and again it was the hosts who took the points. Keita locked down the midfield and also scored in this 2-0 victory for Leipzig. Could we be seeing yet another crazy CM this week?
Griezmann 
We come across a huge name here and the first of two Atletico players to make these predictions. Atletico were away to Levante for their La Liga match and in a dominant 5-0 thrashing, Griezmann bagged two and assisted another. The only annoyance is the fact that he played on the right and not up top.
Depay 
Lyon travelled to Nice for their Ligue 1 fixture and once again the goals were flowing. In a 5-0 thrashing, it was Depay from the left who really stood out. Scoring twice and dominating the match, we will finally see him secure his first inform of the year.
Caligiuri 
Dortmund were hosts to Schalke in their Bundesliga fixture, and wow were we in for a treat! Dortmund led 4-0 at half time and the game was all wrapped up, yet somehow Schalke managed to claw their way back and equalise in the final seconds of the game. An inform has to be given for such a dramatic comeback and Caligiuri is the man who stood it for me.
Gameiro 
Our second Atletico player features now in an almost identical fashion to Greizmann. Gameiro played up top during the 5-0 victory, scoring twice and assisting a third in an almost flawless performance. Let’s hope we see both of these guys get the nod.
Jonas 
Benfica were at home for their weekend match and once again they put on one hell of a performance in a 6-0 thrashing of Vitoria de Sutubal. Again we have several options here, but Jonas was the standout star. Scoring twice, assisting once and being denied a hat-trick by just the woodwork, this has to be enough.
 
Substitutes
Sirigu 
AC Milan were hosts to Torino in this Serie A fixture and although the match ended 0-0, things could have gone very differently. Milan had a total of 17 shots, but a top draw performance from Sirigu in goal, ensured that the visitors took a point.
Austin 
Southampton were hosts to a struggling Everton on Sunday and with both teams needing a win, a tight match was expected. This however was far from reality, the hosts dominated in a 4-1 victory with Austin scoring twice and being denied a hat-trick by the woodwork.
Kluivert 
Ajax were hosts to Roda in their weekend match, and it was the young superstar Kluivert who stole the show. In a 5-1 thrashing he bagged himself a hat-trick from the left and along with it a spot in this team of the week for sure.
Roussillon 
Montpellier were hosts to Lille for their Ligue 1 fixture on the weekend. In an absolutely dominant performance there were plenty of options for these predictions, but with 1 goal, 1 assists and a fantastic performance, Roussillon gets the nod from me.
Nakajima 
Portimonese were hosts to the travelling Tondela for this weekend fixture and it seems the Home advantage paid off. In a 2-0 victory Nakajima scored both from the left wing, hopefully he has done enough for a team of the week spot as well.
Gurler 
Osmanlispor were hosts to Genclerbirligi for their weekend fixture and in a dominant 2-0 showing, it was Gurler who provided both the goals. A brace from a right winger should be enough this week.
O’Hara 
Dundee FC had a tough game at home to Rangers in the SPL this weekend. In an incredibly tight game, it took an 80th minute winner from O’Hara to secure the points for Dundee. A 2-1 win and 2 goals for O’Hara is enough to see him creep into my predictions here.
Adomah 
We head over to the championship now and Aston Villa play host to the travelling Ipswich. In a fantastic showing it was Villa who took the points in a 2-0 victory and Adomah from the left who scored both goals.
Vydra 
Staying in the championship here and we head over to Middlesbrough as they hosted Derby in their weekend fixture. This time it was the travelling team who took the points, and in a 3-0 win it was Vydra from the midfield who scored each and every one of them.
Ogbeche 
We move over to the Eredivisie now where VVV-Venlo were hosts to Willem II. In a 6 goal thriller neither team could close out the match, but thanks to Willem II striker Ogbeche, the visitors ensured they took a point. The game ended 3-3 and Ogbeche secured his hat-trick.
Markov 
Over to the Russian league now and Tosno were hosts to Arsenal Tula. At 57 minutes in and 0-1 down, Markov is brought onto the pitch, and what a decision this was. The match ended 3-2 in favour of the hosts, with Markov scoring all 3.
Miazga 
Vitesse were hosts to ADO Den Haag for the final pick in these predictions and it was the home team who secured the points. In a 2-0 victory, it was their CB Miazga who not only provided a clean sheet, but also bagged one of the goals."
TOTW 30 Predictions,09-Apr-18 15:25,"Starting Eleven
An incredibly tough week for predictions, with so many fantastic performances, especially from attacking minded players, predictions instantly become incredibly difficult. Make sure you check out the Honourable Mentions list at the bottom, as although they may not have quite made our list, they are all in with a chance!
Sirigu 
We start off this week’s predictions with a big game over in Italy. Torino were hosts to Inter Milan and in an incredibly tight match, it was the hosts who edged out a 1-0 win. Sirigu was sensational, without him the visitors would have surely won. With a total of 8 saves, a clean sheet and the man of the match award, he comfortably cruises into this week’s starting eleven.
Pereira
Porto were hosts to Aves for their league fixture this week and in a fairly tight match, they took all three points in a 2-0 win. Now it isn’t common that we see defenders sneak into these predictions without a goal or assist, but with a clean sheet and 9.1 match rating, Pereira has done just that.
Skrtel
Fenerbahce played host to Osmanlispor for their match this week and as most would have expected, it was the home side who took the points. Fenerbahce won the game 2-0, with Skrtle not only keeping a clean sheet at the back, but also providing one of the goals going forward.
Laguardia
While we have an incredible week for attacking options, defensive ones are proving harder to find. Alaves were hosts to Getafe for their La Liga fixture this week and during a 2-0 win for the hosts, Laguardia was the man who stood out. Defensively brilliant, he ensured the clean sheet and with a goal to his name as well, he deserves his place in this week’s predictions.
Eriksen 
Tottenham were on the road this weekend to a Stoke side that are in desperate need of points. Sadly this match wasn’t going to be where they found them, especially with Eriksen playing to such a high level. The match ended 2-1 to the visitors and Eriksen was the man behind both of the goals.
Pogba 
At 2-0 down at half time, United left the pitch looking and probably feeling rather embarrassed. The league title looked all but wrapped up for City, however Pogba had other plans. Scoring twice in a matter of minutes, Pogba levelled the score and a third goal from Smalling wrapped up the points for the visitors. Maybe City aren’t quite as invincible as we thought.
Dybala 
There has been plenty of talk around this Argentinian superstar in recent years and once again he shows the world just what he is capable of. League leaders Juventus were on the road to bottom of the table Benevento, and while the visitors took the points, the hosts really made them work for it. The match ended 4-2 and with a goal from open play and two from the spot, Dybala secured himself a fantastic hat-trick
Welbeck 
Arsenal seem to have finally found themselves some form this season, with back to back wins in the league and a fantastic performance in Europe, surely Southampton would be an easy 3 points. Well, Arsenal picked up the 3 points, however with the match ending 3-2, Southampton really made them work for it. Welbeck was sensational throughout, scoring twice and assisting the third.
Promes 
Spartak Moscow were on the road this weekend as they travelled to Anzhi. The journey was definitely worthwhile for the visitors, and in a 5 goal game, they left as 4-1 winners. Promes was simply unstoppable, scoring not once, not twice, but three times to wrap up his hat-trick.
Aspas 
La Liga hosts some of the worlds top strikers, we constantly hear names such as Messi, Ronaldo, Suarez or Griezmann, but this year, Aspas has proven that he deserves to be up there too. With yet another hat-trick on the weekend, he helped Celta Vigo pick up all three points in a 4-0 win against Sevilla.
Messi 
What would you consider to be he toughest question known to man kind? Why we exist? What happens when we die? Both are fantastic suggestions, but the only correct answer is Messi or Ronaldo. After Ronaldo’s recent streak of pure brilliance, Messi instantly replied with yet another hat-trick on the weekend. Game on Ronaldo.
 
Substitutes
Before we jump into these, it is worthwhile mentioning that we probably won’t see a handful of these pop up. However with the majority of them scoring a hat-trick, we can surely all agree that they are at least deserving of their spots!
Neto 
First up on the bench we have yet another incredible goalkeeping performance. Valencia were at home to Espanyol for their La Liga clash and in a 1-0 victory for the hosts, Neto was the hero on the day. With a total of 6 saves and a clean sheet; he is the goalkeeper sitting on the bench this week.
Pearce 
Picking up an Inform when in a smaller league is usually difficult, but for a defender to achieve this is on a whole new level. Derby were hosts to Bolton for their fixture and during a 3-0 win, Pearce not only secured a clean sheet and a goal, but also picked up the man of the match award too.
Didavi 
Wolfsburg were on the road this week as they travelled to Freiburg for their Bundesliga fixture. Didavi was a man with a mission and from a central role, scored twice to see Wolfsburg pick up all the points in a 2-0 win.
Almiron 
Over to the MLS next where Atlanta United were hosts to LAFC. This match was completely one sided, with Atlanta cruising to a 5-0 win. Now while there were plenty of top performances, Almiron gets the nod from us, scoring twice from the spot and assisting a third.
Depay 
Depay just fell short of an Inform last week and with a large amount of the player-base a little disappointed, he set out this week to make it happen. Lyon picked up a 5-0 win away to Metz and Depay played a part in each and every goal. With 1 goal and 4 assists, surely there is no way he misses out this week.
Lozano 
This is a selection that I feel could make the cut, however when compared to other performances probably falls just short. PSV picked up a 3-2 victory against AZ Alkmaar on the weekend and Lozano, playing at striker, picked up a goal and an assist. For the sake of our mental health, let’s secretly hope this doesn’t happen!
Belotti 
Belotti hasn’t quite had the sensational season he had last year when it comes to scoring, however he has been a critical part of the Torino side and a key player for sure. This week is finally his time to shine and during a 4-1 win at home to Crotone, he picked himself up a hat-trick and with it a place in these predictions.
Eto’o
Konyaspor were hosts to Sivasspor for their match this weekend and in a comfortable 5-0 win, we saw an old legend come back to life! Eto’o proves once again he still has his talent and after scoring twice and securing a 9.4 rating, he storms into our line-up.
Schalk 
Ross County were hosts to Patrick Thistle for their mid-week match, and during a comfortable 4-0 win, we see yet another hat-trick. Schalk was the man of the hour this time and any hat-trick is tough to ignore during these predictions.
Kamberi
This is where things get a little difficult, as we find yet another hat-trick from the Scottish Premier League. Now while I expect EA to feature one of these players, I find it tough to imagine both making the cut. Kamberi with 3 goals in a 3-1 victory for Hibs is definitely deserving, but what will EA decide?
Delfouneso 
Another lower league game and yet another hat-trick here. Blackpool were dominant winners against Bradford on the weekend. Delfouneso was a man in form, scoring three goals during the 5-0 victory.
Grigg
Our final selection this week sees yet another hat-trick enter the mix. Wigan were comfortable 5-1 winners when they played host to MK Dons on the weekend, and Will Grigg was truly on fire once more after scoring three of the goals.

MARQUEE MATCHUPS,13-Dec-17 17:12,"Real Madrid vs Barcelona
Ok, so another week and another set of Marquee Matchup predictions and this time we are going to start things off with a bang! First up today we have what would most likely be classed as the biggest match of the year, between two of the biggest clubs in the world! Real Madrid take on Barcelona in El Clasico. When investing here it becomes obvious we will want gold players, but consider which team has a higher supply, and hence which team's prices will likely rise more as the event approach's or is released. 

Deportivo vs Celta Vigo
As you can see above, one of the biggest games in football is taking place this week, everybody and anybody would instantly include this into any event they create called ""Marquee Matchups"", however EA clearly play by their own rules. As these matches are so unpredictable, it only makes sense to include a backup La Liga derby, and this one features Deportivo and Celta Vigo in the Galician Derby. Investments here are once again extremely straight forward; gold, highest rating possible, discard prices. Simple. 

Celtic vs Partick Thistle
Next up we move across to the Scottish Premier League where we find ourselves with yet another derby. This match falls under the banding of a Glasgow derby, which covers all games between the three Glasgow based sides; Celtic, Partick and Rangers. Investing here is best done as early as possible due to the distinct lack of gold cards available for Patrick. Aim to buy for discard and sell on hype to ensure a safe and steady profit. 

Juventus vs Roma
Over to Italy now where we find Juventus take on Roma. Juventus currently sit in third on 38 points while Roma are hot on their heels in fourth, just 3 points behind on 35. Both teams are aiming for a league title push which makes games like this all that much more significant. Investments here are once again fairly straight forward, aim for gold players, highest rating around, in a strong position, but most importantly make your purchases at discard prices! 

Melbourne City vs Melbourne Victory
We now move over to Australia where we see Melbourne City play host to Melbourne Victory in what could only be described as the Melbourne Derby. This match receives a mention in these predictions, not because I believe we will be seeing it, but simply because it was a nightmare last time around leaving players practically extinct for both teams! As mentioned, we have already seen this once this year, so investments here should be targeting hype selling as it is very unlikely to feature. 

Monterrey vs Pachuca
For the last couple of choices this week we move into an area that EA usually try to avoid when picking their candidates, cup games. First up we see Monterrey take on Pachuca in the Copa MX final. Investments in games such as these immediately add a little risk, simply because EA tend to avoid them, however picking up a few players just to cover all bases while EA are so unpredictable simply cannot hurt. 

Bayern vs Dortmund
Finally, today we head over to Germany where we find one of the largest rivalries there. Bayern are hosts to Dortmund in their third-round clash in the DFB cup and after being left out during their league fixture, possibly there is a chance we see them pop up here. Once again, keep in mind that this is a cup game and that the Bundesliga features in the current MM, so this instantly becomes less likely once more."
Risk vs Reward,19-Sep-17 12:46,"Right, so we are gonna kick off these trading guides with the fundamentals. These basics need to be in place before we start looking at the actual methods and possible strategies.
We see the term ""Risk vs Reward"" thrown around a lot when we talk about investments, but what exactly does this mean?
 
Risk
When we look at the risk of an investment, we are simply looking at the factors that could potentially damage our investments and to what level. We need to remember that this is made up of two parts:

How late we are making the investment (is the price already inflated and to what level, how much profit is still possible)
How likely the investment is to succeed (is this too big a risk and are we placing our funds into an investment that could be deemed too risky)


Reward
Well the reward is simple, we are talking about how profitable we expect our investments to be. If we invest in a player for X and estimate the selling value at Y, the reward is simply Y - X. While the fundamentals are easy, we also need to take into account that if the investment goes wrong, we could be looking at a different equation. If we invest in a player for A and without hype his market value is B, we could stand to lose B - A, this is where the risk and reward need to be taken into consideration.
 
Scenario One
After game week one of a new month, Lukaku has scored a hatrick. You believe this puts him ahead of the competition for the POTM award and hence decide to start making some investments. You have started investing extremely early here and the majority of your investments should still be sitting around their actual market value. This clearly reduces the financial risk to basically 0, but there are still other factors that could potentially make this a worrying investment.
Just how likely are these investments to come off? Well we are only 1 week into a 4/5 week month, this hatrick could be the only thing he does during all remaining games and as a result leave him nowhere near the award and your investments nowhere near paying off. We also have to predict which cards to invest in. Its not like we are guaranteed to guess the requirements right and hence your investments could be left high and dry when the actual SBC is released (this factor isn't so much of a problem luckily as we usually sell of hype, but it is still worth consideration). The final factor to consider is the length of time you are holding onto these investments. At this point in time we have roughly 1 month until the actual award is presented, this means we have 1 month of our funds being tied up, our trade pile being full and a limitation on what we can invest in during this period.
In this situation the financial risk is low and potential financial gain is high, you are almost guaranteed to make your coins back at worst. This makes it a fairly strong investment. Before we pull the trigger though, we need to consider the other risk factors.
 
Scenario Two
After game week two of a new month, Lukaku has scored yet another hatrick. You believe this puts him way ahead of the competition for the POTM award and hence decide to start making some investments. We are now potentially half way through the month and Lukaku is looking like a very strong favorite. Unlike scenario one, we didn't start investing that early and hence prices have started to rise, anything we now buy we will be buying at an inflated price.
The first thing we need to remember is that this doesn't make this a bad investment! There is still an incredible chance that Lukaku wins this award and hence a strong chance our investments return a profit. However we do need to remember that the risk is much higher than it was on week one, and hence our decisions require more thought.
The reward formula remains the same, what we buy the player for against what we expect to sell them for, Y - X. At the same time we need to need to remember that if this investment turns bad we could stand to lose from this formula. This is when the term risk vs reward really comes into play!
If this investment pays off you stand to make X, while if the investment goes wrong you stand to lose Y. Is the chance of gaining X worth the risk of losing Y? This is fundamentally what risk vs reward means, and these are the tough decisions you need to make.
 
Scenario Three
After game week three of a new month, Lukaku has scored a third hatrick. You believe this puts him miles ahead of the competition for the POTM award and hence decide to start making some investments.
He has been a front runner from day 1 and is now practically guaranteed this award. Almost any investments you make will come with incredible risk and should be avoided at all costs. You are buying these cards at a price that has continued to rise over the past 2 weeks and are therefore at an all time high. Any profit margins are likely to be minimal and hence usually makes the risk vs reward equation very unappealing.
This doesn't mean we cannot invest, it just means we need to become more creative. Revert back to scenario one, any cards we pick up now we are going to be holding onto for a week or two at most. Think outside the box, think of potential challenges very few others are thinking about and pick up these cards for their market value. Yes it becomes less likely these cards will be needed, but all we need is a little hype or a little luck and then we are making profit again. The key with this decision is that we are removing the financial risk, adding a shorter timeline of holding onto the cards and hence weighting the equation in our favor.
 
Summary
When investing, use this basic formula to determine how profitable you predict your investments to be at both the best and worst case scenarios. Using both figures you are left with the simple question: Is the risk worth the reward?"

There’s A Problem With Custom Tactics, And A Solution

After testing custom tactics between ourselves and with helpful friends on Twitter and Reddit, we have come to the conclusion that custom tactics do not always apply to your team.
Goran (drpoplove) ran 76 79 49 as his defensive CTs for 11 games in the World Cup mode, but his team would simply drop deep and not press. Only after he touched the CTs mid-match did they start to apply.
So the best way to make sure that your custom tactics are being used is to set them up as you normally would, start a match, pause, select your CT and change any value by 1 (you can then change it back).
If you’d like to test this yourself, hop into an online match and try playing with 25 25 25 as your defensive CTs vs 76 79 49. Compare the 2 with and without mid-game changes.
EA have been notified of this issue and are looking into it, here’s a tweet from Zaro:
 

Thanks for the heads-up, Goran! 👊❤️
We got that and sent it to the teams right away!
Will keep you updated! (o;
— Mr. Zaro (@EA_GZaro) May 31, 2018
 
As of this writing, we’re not sure if this affects core FUT as well. To be safe, we recommend re-applying your CTs in all modes mid-game.
 
Early Reactions To The World Cup Mode

Both of us are enjoying our World Cup time so far, despite the obvious bugs and glitches (scoreboard, offside, etc.).
It feels like this mode is really meant for casual enjoyment, which is a nice change of pace. Packs give you decent pulls, and getting an Icon is super easy! So far, we’ve seen a lot more variety in the teams we’re facing, but that’s to be expected early on.
Of course, this update has absolutely annihilated the FUT market! Prices have hit rock bottom and continue to drop. Some have critiqued this as “killing the game,” but at this point we’re in June 2018.
The next FIFA is roughly 3 months away when you actually think about it, so why not let people have a little bit of fun? Not everyone can play 1000+ matches to grind for the cards they really want, plus there are no more qualifying FUT Champs months.
Enjoyment aside, the custom tactics bug is critical. Also, it would have been really nice to been able to play online FUT WC friendlies.
On another note, we want to give a huge congrats to Michael “Megabit” Bittner for winning the Amsterdam playoffs! He’s a great player and has been known to go 80-0 (both consoles) during the WL Crazy!
So that brings us to FUT FM Raw! If you’ve made it this far you’ll want to tune into our bonus episode, we dig deeper into the World Cup, the playoffs, and GDPR!

MARQUEE MATCHUPS,12-Jan-18 12:14,"Ajax vs Feyenoord
First up this week we head over to Holland where we find the Eredivisie. Ajax play hosts to rivals Feyenoord in a heated derby known only as “De Klassieker”. This is the largest derby in the Netherlands, dating back around 100 years and was formed due to a rivalry of cities between Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Investments here are nice and simple due to the excess supply of gold players for both sides.

Pumas UNAM vs America
Next up we head over to Mexico and the LIGA Bancomer MX. One of the fiercest rivalries in Mexico sees two of the three sides from the Mexico City area go head to head in a derby known only as “Classico Capitalino”. Once again, we have quite a lot of gold cards available here, but if prices begin to rise, don’t be afraid to pick up a few silvers for discard.

Puebla vs Veracruz
Next on the list sees a second game from the Mexican league pop up, and while we are mentioning both, remember we will only see one at most. Puebla play hosts to Veracruz in a derby known as “El Clasico Del Sur” and while both games won’t appear together, having players from all four teams definitely cannot hurt.

Inter Milan vs Roma
Next up we head across to Italy where we find a huge match between two of the top clubs, Inter Milan and Roma. While it may not be a derby per say, with Champions league places so tight, and just 3 points separating the two clubs, this is a game of huge importance. Investments are simple, gold, discard, highest rating possible. 

Lyon vs PSG
Over to France now and once again it isn’t a derby, but two of the top teams in the league going head to head in a heated match. PSG currently sit atop the table, 9 points clear of third place Lyon. A win here for the hosts would see that gap lowered to just 6 points and allow them to really start increasing the pressure. Again, investments are simple and should be gold players here.

Leeds vs Millwall
Next up we move across to England’s second division, the Championship, where we find Leeds playing hosts to Millwall. Now this was not a derby I was initially aware of, however thanks to a bunch of people messaging me, it received a mention in these predictions. Due to the size and stature of this, personally I still don’t foresee it being included, however it’s one of those games that is worth covering with investments, just in case. 

Gent vs Lokeren
For our final pick of the week we head over to Belgium and the Pro League where we find Gent playing hosts to Lokeren in the “East Flanders Derby”. Investments here are once again nice and simple, there is a large enough supply of gold players but if they do begin to rise, don’t be afraid of silver’s at discard again."
The State of The FIFA Pro Scene,01-Mar-18 12:15,"Hey comrades, welcome to the 40th FUT FM, the former European champion, Christopher Bullock!
It was fantastic hearing his perspective on the game, and we thank him for his time. Hopefully he’ll be back soon.
This week we discuss FIFA esports, the potential need for crowdfunding, and much more! Let’s jump right in.
 

 
Is FIFA esports too big to fail, regardless of quality?

When EA introduced FUT Champions as the new competitive game mode in FIFA 17, everyone was extremely excited about it. It heralded the dawn of a new era.
Fast forward one year later, and it seems that a good chunk of players are burnt out from the game mode, with many resorting to playing just enough (11 wins out of 40) to ensure auto qualification.
The question is, will this mode hinder the growth of FIFA esports? Or is the FIFA franchise, associated with the most popular sport on the planet, too big to fail?
It’s hard to say, but it seems that improvements always have to be made if progress is going to happen.

All of us, Bullock included, agreed that FUT Champions is far from our favorite game mode at this time, and the stress it can cause to those who try and qualify to events is a lot to handle. As a result, third party qualification tournaments become extremely important.
EA announced that some of their event spots would be up for grabs in third party tournaments outside the online game modes of FIFA 18.
The most accessible so far has been the Gfinity Challenger series.
Gfinity launched daily knockout cups for almost two months, where the further you got within each cup, the more points you would rack up. After the cups were over, if you gained enough points and qualified within the top 30, you were eligible for the Gfinity Draft (unless already under contract with another organization).
Out of the top 30, ten players were selected to take part in the Gfinity Elite Series and represent their new club. Given that some have been chosen by teams who already have players, a few of these new talents will only play as substitutes, so it’s unclear how much playing time they’ll actually get.
Is this the right format to use in order to give new talents opportunities? Or should we stick solely to online qualification systems?
Bullock mentioned the importance of having many offline competitions around the world in order to decide who qualifies. So while the current system remains primarily online, the addition of third party organizers is an overall step in the right direction.
What do you think about the qualification process? Let us know on Twitter.

Is it time to crowdfund the FIFA esports prize pool?

While the Fifa Interactive World Cup (FIWC) has been running for many years, the general consensus seems to be that the FIFA 17 marked the beginning of a new era for FIFA esports.
It’s no surprise that prize pools in FIFA tournaments are not yet up to par with other more established esports.
An interesting method used by other companies (including Valve) in order to help fund their competitive tournaments is crowdfunding. This can be done in different ways, but generally means offering in-game purchases where a percentage of the money paid will go towards the prize-pool for a specific tournament.
For example, you buy a pack and 10% of your charge goes to the prize pool.
The question is, what benefits would this bring long term? Is it worth it for EA to lose a portion of their profits like that?
Other esports such as Dota have shown that the use of crowdfunding can have multiple benefits. Not only can prize pools increase dramatically and thus allow more players to become full time professional gamers, but playing for that amount of money is arguably more entertaining, translating into more interest for broadcasted events.
This could also largely benefit a company like EA. As like Bullock said, they could offer special in-game kits almost as an equivalent of buying skins in other games. Even if a percentage would go back into the esports side of things, the thought of contributing could attract more users to participate and purchase the in-game items.
Overall this would translate into a great opportunity for EA to cash in on more promotion and add a new dimension to their marketing, whilst offering something of value to players.

The State Of FIFA Esports
 

As previously mentioned, the competitive scene for FIFA is sort of a new one, so any measure of its health is hard to back up.
Speaking to Bullock gave us a glimpse into the stress that being a professional FIFA gamer brings.
For example, what started off a fun new game mode, turned into a stressful chore for professional gamers. The FUT Champions format requires a level of concentrated sacrifice that most other esports spread out over time, and that is why Bullock would love to see the addition of a ranked system in FIFA.
Another aspect that isn’t often considered by most players is the need for improved professional contracts. Bullock mentioned the need for up and coming talents to be patient when looking for an organization to represent.
It’s usually best to wait for the right offer, and not rush into things, as you may end up hurting yourself in the long run with potentially dangerous agreements.
FIFA esports is growing, but it’s going through a lot of growing pains. Both EA and third party organizations will have to be careful about how they organize future events and treat players. To hear more of our thoughts on the FIFA pro scene, be sure to listen to the whole episode above!

FUT FM Episode 46,13-Apr-18 07:15,"Hey comrades! This past year we’ve had the opportunity to have some of the best players in the world join us on the show and share some of their secrets.
If you’ve been listening from the start, you will remember the days when our very own Italian Stallion (Valerio) was racking up Top 100 finishes in FIFA 17 FUT Champions.
While he is still looking to emulate that same success in this year’s title, his consistent 34-37 win finishes make him a great FIFA player. By taking a look back at his journey, this week is all about tips ranging from gameplay to mentality from an Elite 1 player.
 

 
Formations and Custom Tactics

Whether you’re just starting off with FIFA, or you’re an experienced player, knowing your way around formations and custom tactics can help you add lethality to your game.
A good starting point can always be having a look around the community, whether through contributions on FIFA Reddits or YouTube guides, and getting a taste for the most commonly used formations.
While being aware of the most common and effective formations can help, it’s also important to play to your strengths. Valerio’s experience is a testament of that, as he began his journey learning the 41212(2), to slowly transitioning to a 4231 narrow possession based play style.
As for custom tactics, simplicity is important. You’re always better off starting off with the default settings, and gradually making changes here and there to find what suits you best. You’ll see some pros with wild custom tactics out there, but the way they got to that point is through experimentation.
So don’t be afraid on changing the slider based on what you think your team needs. Even if you’re not sure what you’re doing, you’ll learn by experimenting. Attempting to copy someone else’s tactics and style is usually not the way to improve.
 
Game Settings
 

Customization in any FIFA game goes beyond formations, custom tactics, and player choices. You can do a lot more to complement your game style by customizing your game settings.
Two key settings that you should be aware of are analog sprint, and auto switch move assistance.
Analog sprint can be set to on or off. Having it on means that your player will sprint according to how far you push your sprint trigger button (RT/R2). Having it off means no matter how hard you press the button, your player will always look to sprint at full speed.
Auto switch move assistance can be set to none, low, or high. Having it on none means that once you select a player, he will instantly move in the direction your analog stick is pointing. Having it on low, means that for a short period of time, when you select a player, he will keep moving in the direction he was going prior to you switching into him. The same goes for setting it on high, just for a longer period.
While there is no specific setting that will guarantee you to improve, finding the right setting for you can be very beneficial.
Low can be beneficial in those laggy games that make you feel like your players are stuck in mud. It also helps you not rush out defensively, so you end up defending compactly.
Meanwhile, having it on none frees you up to be more responsive to the game. This is better suited for players with excellent finger twitch skills, but perhaps lower anticipation abilities.
 
Failed Experiments Are Key
 

Whether you’re looking for the perfect player, chemistry style, formation or tactic, you will never improve without stepping out of your comfort zone when you’re unhappy with your gameplay.
Valerio has been able to hit 36-37 wins very consistently over the last couple of months, and he’s been having lots of success using the 433(5) formation. He didn’t just stumble upon it though; it gradually became a viable option after lots of trial and error.
It’s also very important to be tying this back to your strengths. The 433(5) formation may be a good one, but it also requires a certain mentality and approach to the game. If you like to play a very direct style, simply trying this without making any adjustments to how quickly you bring the ball up the field will do more harm than good.
The key is to assess your own style first. Do you like to keep the ball for long periods of time, or do you want to try to score with every attack as quickly as possible? Once you figure out where you fall on those 2 extremes, try experimenting with a formation that you think will help you achieve that.
For example, if you aim to keep possession, you’re going to want a midfield 4 or 5. If you want to always be on the attack, having 3 attacking players would enable you to make quick passing movements at the front.
As always, experimentation is important.
 
Training Buddies

Finding somebody of a similar skill level to play lots of practice games is the best way to improve. The more you play, the more you will figure each other out, and the more you will be forced to come up with new ways to break each other down.
It it happens that one of you eventually starts lagging behind, it’s important to call each other out, and see what led to this situation. You never want to be in a scenario where one of the two players consistently wins by a large margin over a longer period of time.
If such a situation occurs, it’s time for a new training buddy. Everyone learns at their own pace, so there’s no reason for you to stunt your own growth by playing someone way better or way worse than you.
If you can’t find time to play each other, finding someone else to review your gameplay can also be helpful. You can take turns in sending each other short reports on things that you could have done differently. Fresh eyes and brains can always lead to new discoveries.
As always, thanks for checking out FUT FM! Be sure to subscribe to the show on iTunes/Apple Podcasts, or Android, to never miss an episode.

Finding Value From SBC's,23-Sep-17 11:33,"So we have FIFA 18 on pre-order, but for now all we can do is access the web/companion app (some of us have limited game time too but not all, so we will ignore that) so how exactly are we suppose to be making coins? Let's look at the negatives, we can't play games, access the catalogue and hence we can only make coins via trading. Now for the positive, everyone else is in the same position as us and due to this, the majority of player prices are extremely cheap right now. 
Of course we have the option to start studying the market, monitoring prices and then investing as and when we see fit, but what can we do initially to start generating some coins? The answer is simple, Squad Builder Challenges!

Starting Off / General Rules
Ok, so we have just loaded the web app, opened up our starter packs and unless we get extremely lucky, we are sitting on around 5,000 coins after selling the contents. Maybe you are extremely unlucky and not quite there, fear not, the chances are things will still be ok, but if you do fall a little behind sniping and bidding is how we are gonna get back on track!
Bidding is your best friend. If we avoid buying players at their BIN price and instead bid on them for minimum, we can save ourselves upwards of 550 coins on each challenge.
It's always worth building the team as a concept squad to ensure you meet all requirements. This ensures you don't end up falling short on rating, rarity or even chemistry (be wary of chemistry as the web app seems to currently include loyalty on all players).
For some challenges the chemistry is fairly low, always remember we have the option of simply having a player or two out of position.
For certain parts you will need the loyalty bonus on some players. Assuming again we cannot access the game, holding onto packed players when you can makes this possible still.

Let's Get Started
Remember when you first loaded up the web page, the flashing lights, the crazy animations and that absolutely useless bronze starter squad that EA kindly provided you with? Well it turns out they weren't all that useless after all!
The ""Let's Get Started"" SBC provides us with three individual challenges that we must complete before unlocking the others. One consists of a single goalkeeper, the next three players in their correct positions and the final is four players, with three nationalities between them. The good news you ask? Well those bronze players you received at the start are more than enough to complete the entire set, we won't be spending anything on these quite yet!
As for the rewards, well don't go getting too excited! We will receive a couple of various bronze packs alongside a two player pack, and the best part is they are all untradable!

Kick Off
If you're feeling scared, fear not, we will ease into these challenges like a duck into water. The first challenge we will be looking at consists of three parts, a bronze team, silver team and a gold team. The chemistry requirements are fairly low and the rating not existent, all they ask is that we use these rarity of players.
The bronze and silver ones should be fairly straight forward. You probably have almost enough bronze players to complete it without entering the market and you can always pick up the silver players you need for discard or even leave the silver part and return when you have a few more in the club! The gold one however, this is where we will need to plunge into the market!
The gold challenge requires a minimum of 80 chemistry alongside a small amount of rare gold players. This challenge couldn't be easier, firstly we need to pick a league, any that have a sufficient supply of gold players (the bigger leagues can tend to be a tiny bit more expensive here), then simply jump onto the market and bid for a gold player in each position. Bidding here is extremely important as every coin at this stage makes a difference. Spending 300-350 per non rare and 650-750 per rare will ensure that you are not overspending.
The reward this time you ask? Well we will be receiving a 25k Premium Gold Players Pack (12 players, 3 rare). Unless you literally open the worst imaginable pack, you will be profiting here. Whether it's by 1,000 coins or 1,000,00"" simply depends on how generous the pack gods are feeling.


Hybrid Nations
Here we go, the bigger challenges with the bigger rewards are now ready for us. While the requirements may look daunting, they are actually fairly straight forward and easy to complete, but let's break it down.

Quads
Nationalities: 4
Players From The Same Nation: Max 3
Team Overall Rating: Min 75
Rare Players: Min 4
Team Chemistry: Min 80
Reward: Gold Players Premium Pack
Suggested Cost: 4,000-5,000 Coins

While there are rules around nationality, there are none around the leagues. We want to aim to use a single league here allowing us to easily achieve the chemistry required. With a team rating of only 75, this means we can probably get away with a couple of silvers too, this can save coins using them as the rare players. 


The Six
Nationalities: 6
Players From The Same Nation: Max 2
Team Overall Rating: Min 70
Team Chemistry: Min 85
Reward: Premium Gold Pack
Suggested Cost: 3,000-4,000 coins

Sticking to a single league again this challenge remains fairly straight forward. The chemistry is guaranteed through this and with a team rating of 70 required, we can easily use a handful of silvers or a couple of bronzes too. The pack here is poor, so expect a small loss, the group rewards however will easily cover this.

It Takes Eight
Nationalities: 8
Players From The Same Nation: Max 2
Team Overall Rating: Exactly Gold Players
Rare Players: Min 5
Team Chemistry: Min 88
Reward: Prime Gold Players Pack
Suggested Cost: 6,000-7,000

Once again we need a load of nationalities but are free to use any league. Choose a single league, then match the nationality requirements. The cost here is slightly higher, but the reward justifies the increase.

National Pride
Nationalities: 10
Team Overall Rating: Min 80
Rare Players: Min 7
Team Chemistry: Min 100
Reward: Mega Pack
Suggested Cost: 7,500-8,500

So for one last time we follow the same pattern, just one league with a bunch of nationalities. Choose this carefully as we need to ensure that there is a wide range available! Due to the LWB/RWB positions and 100 chemistry requirement, we are going to need a few players with loyalty here. If you can use the console to gain this it's easy, if not make sure you use some of those packed players you kept alongside a potential position change for the wing backs. Once again we see an increase in price, but the mega pack we receive should cover this.

Group Rewards
Even if you have had the worst possible luck and are currently sitting on a loss, after this 55k rare mega pack and strict coin management throughout, there is no chance you can be at a loss so far!

Hybrid Leagues
Onto the second SBC now and luckily it follows a very similar pattern to the last one. Remember to bid in order to keep costs down and save a few players for the ones where we require loyalty!

Rare Fives
Leagues: 5
Players From The Same League: Max 3
Team Overall Rating: Min 68
Rare Players: Min 5
Team Chemistry: Min 80
Reward: Jumbo Gold Pack
Suggested Cost: 2,000-3,000

In the previous SBC we saw challenges with restrictions on nationality. This time we simply have the opposite, use whatever nation you want but just match the league requirements, simple! The low team rating here allows us to use a load of bronze and silver players, if these are the rare cards you use it'll save a small fortune too!

Seven Suspects
Leagues: 7
Players From The Same League: Max 3
Team Overall Rating: Min 78
Team Chemistry: Min 85
Reward: Premium Gold Jumbo Pack
Suggested Cost: 3,000-4,000

Once again, stick to one nationality. With a team rating of 78, it's likely that almost all of our players will be gold, but the fact that we don't need any rare players ensures that the cost stays under control.

Prime Nine
Leagues: 9
Players From The Same League: Max 2
Team Overall Rating: Min 79
Rare Players: Min 5
Team Chemistry: Min 99
Reward: Prime Gold Players Pack
Suggested Cost: 6,000-7,000

As long as all players are in their exact position, the 99 chemistry should be achievable here. The rating ensures that it's gold players we mainly use again and the requirement of 5 rare cards is what slightly pushes the price up. Use a single nationality again and it's easy to complete though.

Squad Goals
Leagues: 11
Players From The Same League: Max 1
Rare Players: Min 6 & Exactly Gold Players
Team Chemistry: Min 100
Reward: Mega Pack
Suggested Cost: 7,500-8,500

The final challenge in this SBC, and it's a tough one! Everything has to be gold, 6 of those cards have to be rare and every player must come from a different league. Fill the team with fringe leagues to start, then add players from the bigger ones as they are easily able to cover more positions in the squad. Also keep in mind that we will need some loyalty to achieve the 100 chemistry again, this is where those packed players come into play!

Group Rewards
Once again we grab ourselves a 55k, rare mega pack! With all the players, consumables and other items, once again there is no possibility of us being at a loss right now!

Going Forward
Now we have completed the key challenges with the best value, but there are plenty more out there! Certain teams within both the league challenges provide great value (mentioning them would cause a price spike so it's up to you to hunt them down) and while the league and nation hybrid has great rewards, we are going to need a load of loyalty, so save this one for when you can dashboard/play games to achieve it! 

We want to see any crazy pack pulls you guys get too! Tweet your best players to @FUTBIN and @imaduckquackk."
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,08-Apr-18 06:07,"PSV vs Ajax
PSV play hosts to Ajax in our first selection this week and while this match holds relevance due to the history between the two clubs, this is further intensified due to their current league standings. PSV currently sit atop the table with Ajax close behind in second, and the 6-point swing available from ""De Topper"", gives Ajax a real opportunity to make up some ground. Investments here are nice and simple, keep them gold and keep them cheap! 
 
Benfica vs Porto
Over to Portugal next where we find another derby that carries the same level of importance. First place Benfica play hosts to second place Porto and while a win for the hosts would see the gap increase to 7 points, a loss would see them nervously sitting just a single point ahead of Porto. The derby itself is known as ""O Classico"" and if this is the game we decide to invest in, we want to be aiming at discard value gold players. 
 
Galatasaray vs Basaksehir
Over to Turkey for our next selection and while there is no historical importance to this fixture, once again they currently fill the first and second positions in the league. With just a single point separating league Leaders Galatasaray from second place Basaksehir, everything is on the line when these two sides play. Investments are once again simple, aim for gold cards at discard value. 
 
Tottenham vs Manchester City 
Over to the Premier League now where League leaders Manchester City are away to Tottenham. Now the bonus of this game is that Manchester City also feature in the Champions League and hence you can cover multiple investment routes. We also have the possibility of a Premier League SBC dropping soon, so even if investments fail to initially pay off, we have something for the future.  
 
PSG vs AS Monaco
France is our next destination, where league leaders PSG place host to second place Monaco. Unless we see a miraculous turn of events, the league is already won by PSG however Monaco will be fighting to ensure they finish behind them and also qualify for the Champions League next season. Investments in this are once again gold players only, but it is worth considering which team will have a smaller supply on the market and hence likely increase by a higher margin. 
 
AC Milan vs Napoli
Finally, we find a game that doesn’t feature the team atop the league. Second place Napoli are away to sixth place AC Milan for their Serie A clash and both sides have a real need for all three points. Napoli are still hot on the heels of league leaders Juventus and Milan are still desperately chasing those Champions League spots. Investments are simple and once again the same as every other prediction so far! 
 
Schalke vs Dortmund
Over to Germany now where we have second place Schalke playing hosts to third place Dortmund. With spaces for Champions League spots tighter than ever, both sides are desperately after the three points this weekend. Now when we add to this the importance of the derby between these two sides, the ""revierderby"" things really begin to heat up. Investments here are nice and simple, aim for gold players of a stronger rating and you should be fine. 
 
Sydney FC vs Melbourne Victory
Over to Australia again now, where we find Sydney FC playing hosts to Melbourne Victory. Now usually these derbies in the Australian league gain a lot of hype and excitement, and while this may be the case once again, the fact that the league SBC has just dropped, makes me believe that the already inflated prices will encourage EA to exclude it this time around. 
 
Austria Wien vs Rapid Wien 
Now this game is included within these predictions, not because I believe it will make the lineup (due to it already having been included previously), but because hype usually follows this fixture. Investments here should be bought only at discard and sold into any hype you find. 
 
Champions League 
Last week we saw the four matches from Europe included in the challenge and while this doesn’t enforce EA to include the Champions League this week, it certainly gives them the potential to take that route. Investments in any of these games should follow the same structure, the cheapest gold players available with the highest possible rating. 
Manchester City vs Liverpool
Roma vs Barcelon
Bayern Munich vs Sevilla
Real Madrid vs Juventus"
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,05-Jan-18 18:12,"We are finally at the stage where most leagues are back in business, and hence our options are starting to increase. That being said, this week is still not quite there and when we also add the lack of big derbies or fixtures, predictions become a little more speculative. With La Liga and Serie A featuring in the current MM and no big games for the next round, both have been left out of this week’s predictions.

Liverpool vs Manchester City
As usual, let’s start off these predictions in England and with the Premier League. This week sees Liverpool at home to a dominant Manchester City side, first place vs fourth. Last time these two clubs met there was only one winner, as City cruised to victory. Will the £75,000,000 dining at the back make the difference, or will we simply see a repeat of last time. Either way, investing is simple as both teams have plenty of gold cards, ripe for the picking.

Sheffield United vs Sheffield Wednesday
Staying in England here, where we simply drop down a division and find ourselves in the Championship. If my memory is still working correctly, we haven’t seen this match feature this year and hence any of these cards bought at discard, or at least very close, should see a nice rise on hype alone.

MK Dons vs Wimbledon
For our final game in England this week, we once again drop down a division where we find MK Dons playing host to Wimbledon. Once again, Wikipedia provides all the knowledge, and apparently Wimbledon relocated to Mk Dons in 2003, hence creating a new local rivalry. Investments here are a little more limited, ideally we are looking for discard options whether they be bronze or silver. 

FC Koln vs Monchengladbach
Next up we head over to Germany, and while our first selection here makes the list due to it being a rivalry, this is EA we are dealing with and hence a small list of other games is just below. According to the Bundesliga website, FC Koln vs Monchengladbach, is known as “The Rheinland Derby”, and hence makes our shortlist. Investments in all the Bundesliga games are simple, due to the numerous gold players available.

Bundesliga Fixtures
As mentioned above, we have a handful of big games in the league this week, and personally I wouldn’t like to predict which one EA choose. Just to cover all bases, here are the others that immediately caught my attention:
Bayer Leverkusen vs Bayern Munich
RB Leipzig vs Schalke
Dortmund vs Wolfsburg

Nantes vs PSG
Next up we move across to France and while there is no particular game that really catches the eye, with the lack of leagues / bigger games available elsewhere, I feel EA may slip a match in here. First place PSG are on the road to 5th place Nantes, and that’s the only logic used in making this prediction. Personally this is the long shot of the selections and investing here is dependant on your beliefs.

Al Hilal vs Al Ittihad
For the final game this week, we head over to Saudi Arabia where we find Al Hilal play hosts to Al Ittihad. Now if you read these predictions weekly, you will have seen this league feature a fair few times, yet fail to make it in EA’s final cut, with this derby known as the “Saudi El Classico” taking place, could this be the week it changes? Once again, investments are limited, anything for discard or as close to as possible, should be where you set your targets."
Review - PL SBC Kevin De Bruyne,16-Apr-18 05:48,"You get an SBC… you get an SBC… everyone gets an SBC!  Finally, a collective exhale was had by all and the hordes of FUT Managers with stock piled EPL players claimed a rather unexpected reward in 94 rated Kevin De Bruyne.  The question soon became; is he worth the 580k (XBOX) listed on FUTBIN at the moment?  Or would FUT managers be better served selling the players and reaping the rewards?
Given the fact that De Bruyne would be playing in a CAM or CM role in the different formations I cycle through I was not concerned about his defending statistics.  With this in mind I applied CATALYST for cycle of games and later HUNTER, with better results.  KDB was pulling the strings in the following squad:


 
PACE
It only takes a quick glance at De Bruyne’s base statistics to realize that a pace enhancing chemistry style is needed.  This was obviously the rationale behind my chemistry style choices and I was hoping they would come good.  While there was a noticeable difference in pace with the chemistry styles, I still felt a sluggishness in KDB, especially in acceleration.  Later on I want to talk about the runs he makes, which are amazing, but for now I will base my rating on pure speed.
RATING: 4/5


SHOOTING
FIVE STAR WEAK FOOT.  A good start to every FUT argument about whether Player A is better than Player B.  Undoubtedly this is one of the eye catching components of KDB’s card.  He can absolutely hammer the ball with both feet for sure.  With the CATALYST chemistry style applied I noticed the 89 FINISHING more than I would have expected, especially on his left foot.  Changing KDB to HUNTER was noteworthy and improved his goal return and did not take much away from his passing ability. Still, I felt he missed one too many chances throughout the weekend.
RATING: 4.5/5


PASSING
The man is a wizard when it comes to picking a pass.  All FUT Managers have experienced the “I WASN’T AIMING ANYWHERE NEAR THERE!!” moments while playing FIFA.  Two games into my KDB review I had one of those moments.  Except in this case he picked out a better pass then I had originally intended and it led to a goal.  There are even little intricacies to his passing that I probably wouldn’t have noticed if I was not reviewing him.  Through balls, flicks, long balls, you name it; they all come off with a zip to them that speeds up play.  Accuracy is key with KDB, I bet he could even find Sane in Trent Alexander-Arnold’s back pocket. Sorry City fans.  To be honest, I was shocked at how few assists he had at the end of my 20 games.  It felt like he was at the centre of everything good in my attacking play.
RATING: 5/5


DRIBBLING
Silky.  That could really be the complete summary of KDB on the ball in the end.  He is responsive in the turn, touch tight on spins, and feels like he is always in control.  I am not big on skill moves as my videos always show, but I do rely heavily on turns and tight touches around the box.  KDB was a nice addition to the squad and was able to find space in tight areas with his control of the ball.  My one issue comes back to his pace; the slower acceleration out of the dribble means that players “left of dead” are often right back on you for more.  Not really a dribbling critique, but in the end it did cause me to lose the ball while dribbling a few times this weekend.
RATING: 4.5/5


DEFENDING / PHYSICAL
Defending is not a strong point of KBD and I would say he does alright in the tackle, I would never recommend him as a CDM though.  De Bruyne’s physical stats are not the best reading either when you look at some of the other top CMs/CAMs available.  However, I feel like the combination of his other statistics work in his favor to somehow boost these ratings.  93 STAMINA is still quite good and can easily get your through a match and extra time, no issues there.  70 JUMPING and 78 STRENGTH suggest a player who is good with the ball at this feel and away from would be tacklers.  But I repeat, there is something about KDB’s body type or statistical break down that make these numbers a non-issue.  Like Trump’s lawyer there is something important hidden here, I just can’t make out what.  Regardless, throughout the weekend I was able to push players off the ball defensively, protect the ball, and win a decent amount of headers. 
RATING: 4.5/5

FINAL SCORE 
RATING: 4.6/5
Unlike Dele Alli, KDB is never caught with his pants down and he is always, always, always moving in the right direction.  He is on the front foot and for this reason I was not at all concerned about a small lack of pace.  As each pass is played you can see him making runs into the appropriate spaces and it just opens up your opponent’s midfield and defensive lines.  KDB was the metronome for my squad this weekend and it felt like the pulse was sped up a notch or two with him setting the beat.  But when it comes down to it, is he worth 580k? As of writing this there is a 90 rated Paul Pogba on the XBOX marketplace for exactly 580k.  If you take out the likelihood that most FUT Managers will be using untradeables in the SBC and look at pure cost alone then it comes down to where you want to upgrade a player.  SBC KDB is not only fun to say, he edges it for me in the CAM role.  However, if I am looking for box to box CM that can influence the entire pitch then Pogba is the no brainer.  It comes down to preference for sure, but if you want a CAM who can influence your attack and speed up your play, then KDB is your man.  Cheers for reading.    
 
Game Stats:

 

Game Highlights:"
BPM (Bronze Pack Method),01-Oct-17 17:39,"The BPM (Bronze Pack Method), is something almost any FUT player can use to make coins. The theory behind it is simple, you open up bronze packs and sell almost everything inside. There are different approaches people take when attempting this, which we will explore below.

1. 400 coin packs vs 750 coin packs
Both packs contain the same amount of cards, the only difference with the 750 coin pack is that you obtain 3 rare cards, instead of 1. However, despite a few valuable bronze players, the only rare card that is likely to return a large enough profit to warrant paying twice as much for the pack are squad fitness cards, hence my advice is to stick to the 400 coin packs.

2. Contracts
Now there are two types of player who will attempt the BPM, those who want to make every last coin count and those that can afford to be a little more wasteful.
Bronze contracts give a gold player +1 matches, which is going to take you a while to apply to each player after every game. Now let's throw in some basic math to show the profitability of taking the time to do this.
In each bronze pack you will receive an average of 2/3 contracts. So over 6 bronze packs it is fairly safe to assume you will receive 13 bronze contracts the equivalent of 1 gold contract (200-300 coins). The time it takes to apply each bronze contract is roughly 5 seconds, so to apply 13 it will take you a little over 1 minute. That 1 minute of 'trading' has given you 300-350 coins which works out at 18,000-21,000 coins an hour. Not bad eh?

3. Player fitness
Again, with these cards there are multiple approaches you can take; use, sell or discard. If your using the bronze pack method to obtain players, and you aren't desperate to make every coin count, then sure quick sell. But if you are using this method for profit, let's do the math!
Much like the contracts, you can expect an average of 1/2 of these cards a pack, so again every 6 packs will give at least 7/8 fitness cards. With 6 packs costs 2,400 coins you are likely to receive 1,400-1,600 of those back from simply the individual fitness cards.
List every single one on the transfer list, and eventually some will sell. If your low on coins, and will have space on your transfer list when finished opening packs, then this is ideal. You will lose nothing by listing these items and if they don't sell by the time you come back to opening packs, we can always send them to the club and use them or re-list at a later date.
 
4. Healing cards
Once again, there are two types of FUT player. Those who rotate multiple teams and those who like using a single squad. However if your using this method in order to gain maximum profit, we want to be selling these cards!
Prices of injury cards depend on the type of injury it heals (obviously...). A 'body' or 'head' healing card may be a hard thing to sell, simply because these injuries are far less common. However a 'foot' or 'leg' injury card will more often than not immediately return a profit on the pack. Leg cards selling for almost as much as the rare 'heal anything' cards. Not bad for a non rare is it?
We also have the luxury of a rare healing card, which obviously will sell for a tidy profit!
 
5. Staff cards
Staff cards are ignored by a huge portion of FUT players, which always baffles me. The rewards and bonuses these can provide when stacked up are immense. Personally I keep these until the bonus is maximised, this allows your contracts, healing and fitness cards to gain a small boost, every time you use them.
Manager cards can also be a hidden gold mine. Some nations are extremely rare with just 1 or 2 across the whole game. Keep an eye out for these as they can quickly turn a poor pack into pure profit.
 
6. Stadiums, kits, badges and attribute cards
List them. List all of them. Unless you find a rare kit (which you will only know by 'comparing') list them at start price 150, and buy it now at max. The chances are most of these will not sell, but while you're opening packs and you have space on your transfer list there is no harm in trying.
If they don't sell within the first few attempts, try changing the BIN price to 200. If it still refuses to sell, you can discard as and when you need the space on your list.
Some will insta-sell for max, while extremely rare, this rare occurrence will have earns you 12.5 bronze packs (5000/400). Damn, that's some serious value!
While the majority of these are tough to shift, if there is space on your transfer list there is no harm in trying, especially during the first month or so of the game.
 
7. Players
Either keep every single player, or list every player. Most will sell at some point in the year, many for mega bucks. Discarding will return roughly 10 coins, this is never the correct decision!
Learn the market, understand what sells and when, then enjoy the endless profit!
 
8. Immediate coin unlocks
Nothing needs to be said here, enjoy the free money!

So what's the overall profit looking like?
Let's base this off opening 6 packs, we will receive on average:
13 bronze contracts (200-300coins) 7 bronze individual fitness cards (1,400 coins if sold individually!) 13 players (probably more) (with patience at least 1000 coins) 1/2 injury cards (200-400 coins) Kits etc (200 coins, if we take it as an average) Coin unlock (100 coins, again an average estimate)
Total spend: 2,400 coins Minimum expected return: 3,000-4,000 coins. Profit: 600-1,600 coins
This is all based off standard pack luck, ignoring the hidden gems and big wins you'll pick up along the way!

Using The Upgrade SBC vs Quick-selling
Ok, so let's say you have a bunch of useless, duplicate cards from this method and you are considering selling or running them through the bronze-silver-gold-rare gold SBC.
The average bronze player is worth 15 coins, so the average silver upgrade will cost you 15 x 11 = 165 coins. This provides you with 2 silver players.
Completing this 6 times allows you to grab yourself 3 non-rare gold players, at a cost of 165 x 6 = 990 coins.
Now we need to repeat these steps a total of four times, in order to gain 2 untradable rare gold cards. 990 x 4 = 3,960 coins.
On average these two cards are costing us roughly 4,000 coins and are most likely going to be trash, or simply cards we have no intention of using. In 99.9% of situations, 4,000 coins will outweigh the 2 cards received."
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,28-Apr-18 06:21,"Team of the season is finally here, and while people may not realise this, it directly affects our Marquee Matchup Investments. Firstly, we will see a lot of packs opened and hence there will be an abundance of gold cards available on the market. At the same time, we will see an increased demand for players required, as people will want to complete any and all challenges available in order to gain packs for this promotion. What we want to be looking at, are the cards that can gain the highest demand and hence the most profit.
 
Domestic Matches

Barcelona vs Real Madrid
First up this week, we have one of the biggest matches in modern day football, Barcelona vs Real Madrid, in a fixture known only as El Clasico. The bonus we have with this selection is that Real Madrid also have a chance at appearing due to their Champions League fixture, a double investment is always one of my favourites.
 
Chelsea vs Liverpool
Over to England next and once again we see the double sided investment that we love o so much. Two huge teams from the Premier League, European spots still up for grabs and the fact that Liverpool feature in the Champions League make this fixture more appealing than ever.

Marseille vs Nice
It looks like we’ve done it again! Another team that has a big league match alongside a European cup game! Fourth place Marseille play hosts to fifth place Nice, and with things so tight towards the top of Ligue 1, taking all the points here is a must for both sides. When we also consider the historical rivalry between the two sides, with the fixture known as “Derby de la Côte d’Azur”, we get yet another reason to look very closely at this match.

Salzburg vs Sturm Graz
It’s happened, the unimaginable is taking place! Four picks so far, and four teams that feature within the European semi-finals. Salzburg play hosts to Sturm Graz in the O Bundesliga, and while Salzburg have an 11 point lead atop the table, Sturm Graz are their closest competition in second place. We all know EA likes these 1st vs 2nd Matches, but will we see this one included?

Sporting vs Benfica
Over to Portugal next where third place Sporting play hosts to second place Benfica. The derby goes by the name of “Derby de Lisboa” and while a Benfica win would see the gap widen, a win here from Sporting would see the two clubs go level on points. Just like the other matches so far, we have plenty of gold cards available and most should be at or around discard price too.

Kobenhavn vs Brondby
Next up we see a match that has featured in these predictions a couple of times already. Kobenhavn play host to Brøndby in a derby known as the “Copenhagen Derby” or “New Firm”. Again, investments are plentiful and we shouldn’t be paying a penny above discard here.

NY Red Bulls vs NYCFC
We saw the MLS feature in the current marquee matchups, and this alone is enough to put me off investing here. However we need to remember that hype sells, bronze and silver players won’t be packed as much during TOTS and that with EA, we need to prepare for the unexpected.

Kawasaki vs FC Tokyo
Japan is our penultimate stop for these domestic matches, where we see third place Kawasaki playing host to second place FC Tokyo. A win for either side would see them secure that second spot in the league and once again, these teams with limited or no gold players, can often yield the largest return on investment.

Ulsan Hyundai vs Pohang Steelers
The final match we are looking at his week, takes place in Korea, where we see Ulsan Hyundai and Pohang Steelers going head to head in a match known as the “Donghaean Derby”. Once again, we are looking at bronze and silver players and hence the potential for a big payout becomes possible, all we need is a little luck.

European Matches

Now while we didn’t see these included during the first leg, don’t be too quick in ruling them out for the second. Although it is most likely we see domestic games once more, these have every chance of popping up once again.

Roma vs Liverpool
After Liverpool’s incredible first 80 minutes, in true Liverpool fashion the fitness and energy levels began to dwindle  as they conceded twice to give Roma a glimmer of hope. The match ended 5-2, and although Liverpool are in a fantastic position, we have already seen how quickly Roma can turn around a 3 goal deficit.

Real Madrid vs Bayern Munich
Bayern Munich took a 1-0 lead, early into the first leg and with them playing at home, it looked like we could have a tough semi-final on our hands. Madrid however once again showed their strength, the match finished 2–1 in their favour and with them at home for the second leg, I would be surprised to not see them progress.

Atletico Madrid vs Arsenal
An early red card for Atlético gave Arsenal the exact boost they needed, surely against 10 men at home, they could come out on top and give themselves the advantage they needed. A goal from Lacazette gave them this boost, however a late equaliser from Griezmann evened things up on the night, and surely give Atlético the advantage moving into the second leg.

Salzburg vs Marseille
Marseille has the home advantage for their first leg against Salzburg and after a fantastic team performance, 2 assists from Payet and goals from both Njie and Thauvin, they have given themselves a fantastic chance of reaching the finals. The only question that remains, is whether they can show this form once more in the away leg."
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,29-Dec-17 18:13,"As the festive period comes to a close, we have one final week where the majority of the leagues are yet to kick back into full force. Due to this our possible selections become slightly limited and hence EA get to roll those marquee matchup dice once more. This being said, we still have a handful of potential matches to choose from, so let’s jump straight into things!
 
Arsenal vs Chelsea
Our first match finds us heading over to the Premier League, where two top flight, London based clubs, go head to head in their midweek fixture. Investments here are nice and simple with both clubs having a wide supply of gold cards available.

Sevilla vs Real Betis
Flying across to Spain next where we see Sevilla play hosts to Real Betis in the “Derbi Sevillano”. Like with most of these larger leagues, we have an abundance of gold players available to choose from, so in order to get our edge over others we need to be considering rating, position, nationality and rarity.

Fiorentina vs Inter Milan
Next up we don’t have to travel too far, as we find ourselves scouting through the Italian leagues in a desperate hope to find some value. While not a derby by nature, both clubs are fairly prominent within the Serie A and hence this is where we roll the dice and hope for the best. Picking up Serie A players can prove useful regardless of the chosen match, as they are often required elsewhere, but if your looking for a riskier pick then here you go!

Benfica vs Sporting
Staying in Europe once more as we travel across to Portugal and the Liga Nos. Benfica are hosts to the travelling Sporting in a match known only as “Derby De Lisboa”, a derby between two clubs from Lisbon. Once again there is a wide supply of gold players for these clubs so we have plenty of options available.

Newcastle Jets vs Central Coast Mariners
For our final pick of the week, and possibly the most lucrative selection, we head all the way across to Australia where we find Newcastle Jets playing host to Central Coast. This derby goes by the name of the “F3 Derby” and according to Wikipedia, it is simply based around geographic locations of the clubs. This match takes place on Tuesday morning, just in time to make the cut for this week’s predictions and if we plan on investing here, get in quick and get cards for discard.
 
Like mentioned above, it’s an extremely tough week to nail down and confidently predict these games. Picking up a small variety of players from each league playing can’t hurt, as this will cover you for completing the challenges, however if you manage to guess a couple of these games correctly, large profits could follow!"
Coin Management,19-Sep-17 14:03,"Coin  Management – What exactly does this phrase mean? Well it is actually as simple and straight forward as it sounds, we are simply managing our coins in a way that ensures we use them in the most efficient manner.  Simple right?  Let's break it down a little further though to cover all bases.
 
Generating Coins At The Start
If you are reading these guides, you are clearly reading them with the hope of learning/improving on how to trade, however in order to do this we need an initial chunk of coins.
At the start of FIFA, returning players are granted a small amount of loyalty packs alongside access to the EA catalogue. The packs are straight forward: open packs, hope you get stupidly lucky, profit/cry.  The EA catalogue adds a little more flair to the game and provides us with a couple of methods to make some fast coins!
Coin Boosts - This is the big one, the holy grail of catalogue items. We have a large selection of these to choose from (depending on your level) and each and every one of these can be used once. These boosts add between 200-1000 coins at the end of each game, and can last anywhere up to 15 matches.  Ensure that you always have one of these active and then simply rinse your way through as many games as possible until you exhaust this pretty little gold mine!
99 Contract - This does exactly what it says on the tin, adds 99 contracts onto a player of your choosing.  The great thing about this particular item is that you can trade it, and nearer the start of a FIFA cycle you are usually able to receive a few thousand coins for it as well, just what we need!
Kits, Balls and and other consumables - Any excess balance you have left over with your EA points can be spent on novelty items, like the ones mentioned above. We obviously have no need for these items, and listing them on the market isn't an option, so we will simply be buying as many as possible and quick selling them!  This is not going to make us rich, but it will definitely increase our capital for trading a little down the line!
If you have access to most items in your catalogue, and are happy enough using a starting team / players you obtain from your free packs, then you should be pushing 50,000 coins already. 50,000 coins and you have done literally nothing except play the game in the way it was intended.  This whole trading thing is pretty easy right?
 
Upgrading Your Team
So let's assume everything above went perfectly, you were able to unlock everything and you now have 50,000 coins.  The obvious next step is to start spending coins on dream players for your team!  Now there is nothing wrong with this approach, the goal of this game is to upgrade players to the ones you love and cherish, however this will not help you acquire a mass of coins in the future and as these players quickly start receiving new cards, you may very well decide it was a poor decision.
If we think back to the previous FIFA, ""Cheap Beasts"" only became this after they were discovered by someone else.  This should be the initial goal, to create a gold team of cheap players who we are able to pick up for as close to discard as possible.  There will be numerous fantastic guides on this sub allowing us to find such players, and I cannot recommend using these enough!
If we decide to go down the other route, picking up bigger names and the top players, we will be able to see a distinctive drop in value by the hour as more and more packs are opened, more of these premium players enter the market and hence prices plummet.  Picking up any player near the start of a cycle almost guarantees a coin loss over a fairly short period of time.  If you are happy using bronze players for longer you can once again maximize coin value and capitalize during the first market crash, however this is a game at the end of the day and we need to make sure we enjoy it while attempting to collect this virtual currency!
After a few weeks, the market will contain handfuls of discard value gold players (assuming these new daily/weekly challenges don't completely change everything), this is when we can experiment and try bunches of new players with practically 0 risk!
A final point to add, and we will pick up on this in the next section, is that we are going to want to complete squads.  The initial cost here may scare some people off as you are effectively spending twice as many coins.  Another chunk of people hate having to rotate teams as it stops you from getting a feel of how all the individual players play, their strengths and weaknesses.  All we should be thinking about though is how this saves us coins and puts us in a better position down the line, the answer, fitness.
 
Consumables
I will keep this topic short as i plan to cover this in more depth within another guide.
Any consumable used, should cost you ""0 coins"" -  Now in theory this is impossible, every card has a discard value or some sort of value on the transfer market.  So what exactly do I mean here?  I am a huge believer of just how effective the BPM (Bronze Pack Method) is and from this not only will you generate hundreds of useful players, but also hundreds of useful consumables.  Anything that sells, we will obviously be selling, but the likes of contracts, which simply clog up your transfer list, are going to be of huge significance!  Yes its boring, yes it drags on, yes it takes forever to apply them, but using these bronze contracts we acquire will save us a fortune compared to buying / not selling the gold ones.
Above we briefly touched on building a second team, the soul reason for this is fitness.  Whether individual fitness cards or squad fitness, everyone of these cards have a value and hence everyone we acquire should be listed on the transfer market to generate additional coins.  By simply rotating your teams (ensuring the other is on the bench and reserves), we will have no use for fitness cards and will be able to sit back and watch the coins saved pile up!
Healing, attribute, kits, badges - anything else that falls into this category!  If they sell, we are selling, if not, then feel free to go crazy and use them as your heart desires!
 
Bankroll Management
Bankroll management is a term commonly used in poker, and simply refers to how you manage the available funds you have to play with.  For example, if you have £100 on your account and decide to enter a tournament that costs £100, this is awful bankroll management.  If you make some bad decisions, poor mistakes or simply have luck go against you, you have no funds left to recoup the losses and rebuild your bankroll.  If you decide to enter a tournament that costs just £10 however, having a complete blowout still leaves you with 90% of your initial bankroll, allows you to learn from your mistakes and ultimately provides you with extra chances to get things right.
This logic applies directly to trading within FIFA.  If you throw all of your coins into an investment that goes wrong, you are either left with nothing or a mistake you can learn from and a large chunk of your coins to play with.  It is extremely easy to misread a market, buy when players are inflated or simply make a poor choice, we need to ensure we give ourselves space to recover if this happens.
Keeping the analogy on poker, no matter how strong your hand is, there will be very few occasions that you can be 100% positive you have the best hand.  These are the situations where over-committing becomes common and easy to do.
You've done your research, invested in players at great prices and haven't committed all your coins.  Suddenly hype kicks in, everybody starts talking about the investments you made and how they are incredible and totally the correct choice.  Despite getting in early, you buy into the hype, you begin investing more into these players at inflated prices.  Before you know it you are in a situation where if this investment doesn't pay off you are losing coins, you simply over committed with a hand that you couldn't be 100% about.
Do your own research, make your own decisions and stick to them, regardless of what others are doing or saying!
 
SBC
Not a lot to say here, so let's keep this short and sweet.  If you cannot guarantee yourself a profit, don't do them.  Yes we all enjoy risks, yes we all think that maybe the next pack will contain that dream player, but the reality is it just will not happen.  Work out the value of the rewards, compare that to the total cost of completion and then decide, is this really worth it?
If you use solutions found on FUTBIN, be aware that certain players can quickly become inflated due to demand rising as multiple people use the same squad.  Ask yourself if these players can be substituted with other/cheaper alternatives."
RATINGS REFRESH - ROTW,05-Feb-18 10:30,"Rest Of The World (ROTW):
 
Sadly our Rating Refresh predictions had to come to an end eventually, and with the rest of the world, that day is today. We have some long overdue upgrades, some that may strike fear into FIFA players across the world and even some downgrades, downgrades that simply leave you asking “what happened?”. 
So without further ado, here we go!

Jonas +1 Upgrade
First up we head over to Portugal, where we find Benfica sitting just three points away from top spot in the Liga Nos. Year after year we see this mans name pop up and almost never for the wrong reasons. With 24 goals, 5 assists and 9 man of the match awards in just 20 league appearances so far, a plus one upgrade is the least this man deserves.

Promes +1 Upgrade
Over to Russia next where Spartak Moscow player, Quincy Promes, could only watch and hope as his deadline day dreams of a move to the Premier League slowly faded away. There is no surprise why Southampton were chasing this winger though, with 10 goals and 6 assists from just 16 league appearances, Promes provides a goal per game, something any Premier League side could use! 

Brahimi +2 Upgrade
Straight back to Portugal once again, where this Algerian winger has been tearing things up once again. Porto are currently second in the Liga Nos, 1 point behind the leaders, but with a game in hand. As usual, the players are responsible for this fantastic season, especially players like Brahimi. With 5 goals, 6 assists and 2 informs already this season, a jump from 82-84 rated, only seems fair.

Alex Telles +2 Upgrade
While we are in Portugal, it seems silly to move again and while we are talking about an inform Porto, it makes no sense not to name another player! Alex Telles may not have the incredible goal scoring numbers that we have seen previously in this write up, but for a left back, I think that can be forgiven. With just 9 goals conceded from 19 games, Porto concede once every 2 games, and having played every single minute so far this season, Telles is a key part of this. When we also add the fact that he holds 6 assists as well, a +2 upgrade becomes very understandable.

Talisca +2 Upgrade
Over to Turkey next, where we find ourselves looking at standout performances within the Super Lig. With two Informs already, Talisca has really been turning heads so far this year, bagging 7 goals and 3 assists from just 17 games. When you consider this guy is a midfielder and add on the other roles he undertakes during a match, the work ethic is simply through the roof and a +2 upgrade is thoroughly deserved.

Tosun +2 Upgrade
Now I know that Tosun is technically a Premier League player now and technically shouldn’t be brought up here, but who really cares about technicalities anyway? Looking at his time at Besiktas, Tosun bagged 4 goals and 2 assists from his 5 starts in the Champions League, but also 8 goals and 1 assist from his 12 starts in the league. These stats simply couldn’t be ignored, which is the exact reason Everton pounced upon their first opportunity! While he may not see a new NIF in the Super Lig, if this +2 goes through, we could see a fantastic, cheap Premier League striker instead!

Alessandrini +1 Upgrade
When you have such a long list of players to choose from, picking a few players to write about can often be difficult. Now when one of those players has caused you numerous nightmares already this year, you are probably going to want to ignore them, right? No chance, we confront our demons! With the MLS season all wrapped up, this 28 year old, French winger’s season looked pretty darn solid. With 13 goals and 11 assists from the 27 starts he had, he almost provided a goal per game for LA Galaxy. A +1 boost here feels extremely possible, and while we all may fear this, we should really start adapting to this likely reality!

Pepe -1 Downgrade
For our final player in this write up, we will remove some of the previous positivity and instead change our attentions to a potential downgrade. After leaving Real Madrid last year, it appears that both Pepe and his old club have simply started to crumble. Besiktas have conceded 18 goals from 19 games so far in the league, roughly 1 per game, and with an average match rating falling at just 6.80 so far this year, Pepe has to take some responsibility here. Now it’s only the halfway mark, and everything could change, but as it stands an 86 rating feels a little high and hence we predict a -1 downgrade here.

MARQUEE MATCHUPS,19-May-18 07:03,"With most domestic seasons already having come to an end, picking our predictions can instantly become a lot more difficult. With a whole heap of international friendlies, playoff games and cup finals to choose from, we really are spoilt for choice this week.
 
Liverpool vs Real Madrid
First up we have what can only be described as the biggest game of the year, the Champions League final, and as a Liverpool fan, to say I was excited would be nothing short of an understatement. With gold prices already inflated, the Europa League final already having featured, and lack of lower tier gold cards, investments here could prove to be very lucrative indeed.
 
Fulham vs Aston Villa
Next up we have one of the most lucrative matches in world football, with the winner receiving a one way ticket up to the Premier League. Fulham overcame a 1st leg loss to book their ticket here, while Aston Villa suffered 90 minutes of boring football to maintain their first leg lead. While we have gold cards available, get in fast and aim for discard, otherwise settle for silvers here.
 
FC Zuerich vs Young Boys
Another game and another Cup final now, with FC Zuerich and Young Boys facing off in the final of the Swiss Cup. Luckily we have plenty of available gold cards in which we can invest here. Keep things simple, consider positions, nationality and of course, prices.
 
Rosenborg vs Bran
No way is our next stop, where we find second place Rosenborg playing host to league leaders Bran. Not only does this game feature the top two sides in he League, but it also carries historical relevance and a rivalry between the two sides. Investments here are fine at any rarity, just aim to keep the cost down.
 
LA Galaxy vs San Jose Earthquakes
Over to America next, where LA Galaxy and San Jose Earthquakes face off, in a derby known as the “California Clasico”. Investments here vary depending on how  early you are able to buy. The key is discard prices, don’t overspend and you won’t be left with regret!
 
Sporting KC vs Columbus
Now, as usual, when we cover multiple games from a single league, at best we are expecting one of them to feature. Keep this in mind when it comes to investments, and don’t expect both to pop up! Sporting KC play Columbus in our second selection in the MLS, 2nd place against 3rd. Investments here should revolve around discard bronze or silver, to reduce risk.
 
International Friendlies
Now while we have a whole heap of international friendlies to choose from, picking out a single match proves to be extremely difficult. Instead, picking up players from the more unique nationalities could help to cover all bases, and even potentially provide a lucky investment too!"
TOTW20 Predictions,29-Jan-18 17:39,"Starting Eleven
Viviano 
Sampdoria were away to Roma for their weekend fixture where in an incredibly tight match, they just managed to secure the points with a 1-0 victory. It was anything but smooth sailing though and took 8 incredible saves from Viviano, including one from the spot, to ensure a clean sheet was kept.
Calabria 
AC Milan were hosts to Lazio for a Sunday Serie A fixture and while the game was incredibly tight, one side managed to just edge the win. With a 2-1 victory for AC Milan, our nomination goes to their left back, Calabria. An assist and solid all round performance could be enough to see him recieve his first Inform too.
Boateng 
Bayern played hosts to Hoffenheim for their Bundesliga fixture and in a game of seven goals, it was the hosts who emerged as 5-2 victors. We have plenty of possible candidates for this TOTW, and I wouldn’t even bu surprised to see two sneak in, but our nomination goes to Boateng with a solid game and a goal.
Naldo 
Staying in the Bundesliga here with Schalke travelling to Stuttgart. In a comfortable 2-0 victory for the travelling side, it was Naldo who really stood out. A fantastic defensive display combined with a sensational goal will surely see Naldo cruise into the lineup.
Sessegnon 
Fulham have found some fantastic form as of late, but this man in particular is on a whole different level. Fulham beat Barnsley 3-1 on the weekend and once again, Sessegnon bagged two of them. A third Inform feels extremely possible as well as a big money summer move perhaps!
Kroos 
In an important match towards the top of La Liga, Real Madrid were on the road to hosts Valencia. In a five goal game, it was the visitors who outclassed their opposition with a comfortable 4-1 victory. While Ronaldo scored twice from the spot and Marcelo once from LB, they both recently had TOTY cards, so move over and give Kroos his moment!
Khedira 
Juventus were away to Chievo for their Serie A clash on the weekend, where in a dominating display they left 2-0 victors with all the points. Higuain bagged one of these goals, which simply won’t be enough for a second Inform here however Khedira was fantastic in the midfield and also bagged the other!
Castillejo 
Villarreal were hosts to Real Sociedad for their La Liga fixture and in a game of 6 goals, it was the hosts who emerged as 4-2 champions! While there were some solid performances across the board, Castillejo with his one goal and assist was the player who really stood out.
Anderson 
We move over to the Serie A now where and in Lazio’s first game of the week they were hosts to a travelling Udinese and were also 3-0 winners too. Anderson was the man who stole the show, with a goal, an assist and an almost perfect performance, surely he has done enough to bag himself an Inform.
Cavani 
Over to Ligue 1 now where an on fire PSG were hosts to Montpellier. In yet another confident victory, PSG left as 4-0 winners and while Neymar was the standout superstar, his current TOTW removes him from these predictions. Instead we turn to Cavani, a goal and an assist may be enough, but if not I expect to see Di Maria!
Mertens 
Our final spot in this week’s starting eleven goes to a Belgium striking sensation by the name of Mertens. Napoli were hosts to Bologna for their weekend match and in a 3-1 victory, Mertens scored twice and set himself up for a potential third Inform too!
*Due to lack of time and personal reasons we weren't able to elaborate on the substitutes"
TOTW8 Predictions,06-Nov-17 16:59,
Super Lig TOTS Predictions,20-Apr-18 12:42,"Starting Eleven
Muslera 
Picking goalkeepers here was tough, not due to the lack of candidates or stand out performances, but simply due to the sheer volume of them. Our first pick goes with Galatasaray’s goalkeeper Muslera, a combination of his solid performances and bigger name, feels like it should be enough to see him make the cut. An average of 2.2 saves a match and management of his back line, are he key reasons he takes out first spot.
Mariano
There is a good reason as to why Galatasaray sit atop the table, which is enforced by the volume of their players included within these predictions. With a massive 65 goals scored this season and just 30 conceded, Mariano has played his part in both. Defensively solid at the back and with 2 assists and 5 goals, he shows he is also a real danger going forward when required.
Pepe 
With Pepe’s move from Real Madrid to Besiktas in the summer, people have started to think his career was coming to an end. However, at the ripe old age of 35, he shows that there is still fight left in this defender yet. Besiktas have conceded just 24 goals so far this season, and a lot of that is due to their solid defensive line-up. Pepe has proved that you only retire when ready, and yet another team of the season card would prove that this could be years away yet.
Maicon 
Straight back onto the league leaders for this next pick, where we find a centre-back who was not only a monster at the back, but also has a rather impressive goal-scoring record. After playing almost every game this season, Maicon has helped Galatasaray to the top and his 5 goals scored this campaign, is simply the cherry on top.
Behich 
The final defender making the starting eleven is Bursaspor’s fullback, Behich. Now while Bursaspor sit 13th in the table, with just 40 goals conceded they maintain a respectable defensive record. With 5 goals and 2 assists to his name as well, Behich shows that he is the complete package.
Giuliano 
Onto the midfielders now, and first up is Fenerbahce’s Giuliano. With 58 goals scored so far this campaign, Giuliano has contributed to 14 of these. With 2238 minutes played in the league this year, 13 goals, 1 assists and 4 man of the match awards, this was one of the easiest inclusions for these predictions.
Talisca 
From one outstanding midfielder to another now, as we move on to Talisca, from Besiktas. Currently second in the league, Talisca has been a huge part of their success. With 12 goals, 4 assists and a massive 5 man of the match awards, this man cruises into the starting eleven and will provide an incredible blue card for FUT.
Feghouli 
We move onto yet another Galatasaray player now and while Feghouli’s goals scored may initially appear a little lack-lustre at 6, the impact and influence this man has on the pitch, is nothing to be ignored. On top of the 6 scored, Feghouli has also provided 8 assists from just 20 starts this year. Surely he has done enough to make the cut.
Quaresma 
Quaresma is next on our list and once again if you are simply looking at stats, this man may look incredibly underwhelming. With just 3 goals and 6 assists this season, we are looking elsewhere to justify this mans inclusion, but when we consider his 7.44 average match rating and 4 man of the match awards, Quaresma simply sails into the starting line-up.
Adebayor
Onto the strikers now and our first selection goes with Adebayor from Basaksehir. Firstly we need to take a moment to recognise just how incredible their season has been, currently sitting in third, just one point separates them and first place Galatasaray and with a handful of games remaining, everything can change. With 49 goals scored this campaign, Adebayor has been a part of over 25% of them. With 12 goals, an assist and 6, yes 6 man of the match awards, this guy is a lock for me.
Gomis 
Our final player to make the cut is Bafetimbi Gomis from Galatasaray. For this man we need to look no further than physical stats, to see just why he makes the cut. Galatasaray have scored 65 this campaign, and with 26 goals and 5 assists, Gomis has played a part in almost 50% it them. If there was one player you would bet your house on making the team; then it simply has to be Gomis.

Ligue 1 TOTS Predictions,26-Apr-18 10:09,"Starting Eleven
Lopes 
Lyon have had a fantastic season so far, currently just a point off second place Monaco and well within Champions League spots for next year. Lopes has been absolutely critical to this success, averaging a massive 3 saves per match and with 38 goals conceded so far, this man takes our first spot in these predictions.
Alves
Alves has done it all within his career, he has played for the Champions in Italy, Spain and with PSG he has conquered France too. Absolutely solid at the back, PSG have conceded just 23 goals in their current campaign, and while he has been a critical part of this, Alves has shown that he is also a danger going forward. With 1 goal and 7 assists to his name, he takes our starting spot at right-back.
Thiago Silva 
From one defensive superstar to another now, as we remain with the league champions, PSG. Now while Thiago Silva may not have had quite as an impressive season as previous years, he has still shown leadership and quality throughout. The teams impressive defensive record speaks for itself, and once again Silva has been at the heart of it all.
Glik 
We move away from the league leaders now and onto second place Monaco. With 77 goals scored and 44 conceded, it’s clear to see why they sit so highly in the league and when we also consider the defenders contributions to both aspects of the game, we get some clear cut nominations too. Glik is up first, solid at the back and with 3 goals and 3 assists also under his belt, he slides into this lineup with ease.
Jorge 
Staying with Monaco here, as we move onto their left-back spot with Jorge. We have already spoken about their defensive qualities this year, and Jorge has been nothing short of critical in this success. With an average match rating of 7.33, 2 assists and even a goal to his name, hopefully he has done enough to earn his team of the season spot this year.
Fekir 
Moving onto the midfielders now, and our first choice is one of the most obvious and deserving players you will find. Fekir has been absolutely breathtaking this season, and with 17 goals and 6 assists for Lyon, the figures alone show this. He is surely one of the front runners for player of the year and hence a lock for these team of the season predictions too.
Fabinho
Back across to Monaco now, where we find a player who is quite literally the foundation to everything Monaco has built. Defensively Fabinho has been incredible, controlling the midfield and locking out opponents, however we also need to take note of his attacking attributes as well. With 6 goals and 3 assists, Fabinho proves he is the complete package and the 5 man of the match awards are simply the cherry on the cake.
Thauvin 
Thauvin is up next on our list, and it’s difficult to explain just how incredible his season has been, in such a small paragraph. Marseille have scored 74 goals so far this season, Thauvin himself has contributed to nearly 40%, having scored 19 of them, alongside 10 assists. The fact that he has received 11 man of the match awards along the way is unlikely to surprise many, and to even imagine a prediction list without him is simply ridiculous.
Neymar 
After his record breaking transfer from Barcelona, the pressure to succeed was greater than ever. People may have doubted just what he was capable of, but after his first season with PSG, those doubts have vanished. Neymar managed 19 goals and 13 assists in the league, and while these stats are incredible as they are, the fact that he has been out for months with an injury, just further cements his incredible talents.
Falcao 
A few years back and Falcao was having a rough time with his career. He struggled to make an impact in England, however his move to France almost instantly seemed to get his career back on track. With 18 goals and 3 assists, he has played a part in over 25% of Monaco’s goals this year and his spot in these predictions is completely deserved.
Cavani 
Since Ibrahimovic’s departure, Cavani has had the chance to lead the line for PSG. Despite the pressure and challenges, Cavani has rose to the occasion, proving that he is the right man for the job. With a total of 25 goals and 6 assists so far this year, he leads the race for the golden boot and also secures his spot in these predictions.
 
Substitutes
Ruffier
Saint-Etienne have had an incredible season so far, they currently sit sixth in the league, a mere point behind Nice. Now while they may have conceded 46 this season, it is without doubt that this number would have been a lot greater without Ruffier in goal. Averaging 3 saves a match, this 31 year old Frenchman has been sublime and has won his club numerous points across the year.
Mukiele
Montpellier currently sit 8th in the table and while their season so far has been impressive, it’s clear to see where their strengths and weaknesses are. With only 32 goals scored, they fall into the second half of the league for this category, but with only 30 conceded, they have the second best defensive record, only behind league leaders PSG. Mukiele has been an integral part of this success and his nomination here is totally deserved.
Marcelo 
Lyon’s successful season is largely made up of just how clinical their attackers have been in front of goal, however when we take their defensive record into account, the accomplishments remain equally as impressive. With just 38 goals conceded so far this campaign, it’s clear just how important Marcelo has been, and the 3 goals, 1 assist and man of the match to his name, can only help his cause here. v
Amavi 
With a single point separating second and fourth place, Champions League spots are still available for those who can finish this season the strongest. Amavi has been a huge part of Marseilles success, both defensively and going forward. Solid at the back and with 6 assists to his name, if he can continue to find this form then we could see Marseille feature in the Champions League next year.
Sidibe 
While the league title is wrapped up, second place is still a real possibility for several clubs and currently, Monaco lead this race. Sidibe has been a fundamental part of the squad this season, defensively sound, while also contributing with 2 goals, 6 assists and 4 man of the match awards as well.
Gustavo 
We have already spoken of Marseille’s success this season, their strengths across the squad, but now we need to look at the glue, the centre-piece that holds everything together. Gustavo has been incredible as a holding midfielder, supporting both the defence and attack. The 5 goals scored this season and Marseille’s current position are a testament to this mans work ethic.
Aouar 
At just 19 years old, Aouar shows that age is nothing but a number. Showing experience beyond his age, fantastic understanding of the game and incredible vision both going forward and while defending, Aourar has been sensational for Lyon this year. Whether holding down the midfield, supporting his defence or even going forward, with his 5 goals and 4 assists, he shows that he is the complete package and is a well deserving nomination here.
Payet 
A few years back and Payet was tearing up the Premier League with West Ham. Things turned sour, his performances took a dip and that year he forced his way back to Marseille. Now it may have taken a while, but it looks like Payet is well and truly back to his best. The 5 goals and 12 assists in the league this year, simply don’t do him justice, the role he has played in Marseille’s Champions League push has been of significant importance to say the least.
Mbappe 
What really needs to be said about this nineteen year old superstar? After a huge money move to PSG in the summer, Mbappe has proven his worth and shown the world that he is the real deal. With 13 goals, 8 assists and 7 man of the match awards in the league, it is no surprise that he has helped PSG lift another title and if this is what Mbappe can achieve now, it’s hard to even imagine what he will be capable of with more experience.
Depay 
Ever since Depay’s move from Manchester United, he has proven that he is still has the potential that people once spoke of. It seems as if he only improves with each passing match and after a solid start to the season, he has shown pure brilliance during the second half. He has played a part in over 33% of Lyon’s goals this year, with 15 goals scored and 11 assists provided. When we then consider his 6 man of the match awards and average rating of 7.31, surely we will be seeing a blue Depay this year.
Malcom
Bordeaux are currently 11th in the league with 44 goals conceded and just 39 scored. Now when we look into Malcom and see that he was a part of around 40% of these goals, you see just how impressive this youngster has been. With 9 goals, 6 assists and 6 man of the match awards, he has been a diamond in the rough this season.
Mariano
Now we have already spoke about several fantastic performances players from Lyon in these predictions, so let’s add yet another into the mix! Mariano has been a goal-scoring machine up top this year, with 18 goals scored and 4 assists, his clinical nature and constant development is a joy to watch. The question is, will he be rewarded by a blue card in a video game, because at the end of the day, that’s all that really matters.

MARQUEE MATCHUPS,21-Dec-17 17:02,"Brighton vs Bournemouth
First up this week we head over to the Premier League where we have a whole heap of fixtures to sink our teeth into! The worry is that none of these games really jump off the page and into a ""guaranteed"" marquee matchups spot.  
With each team playing up to 3 times each during this period, EA could choose absolutely any game without justification, however we are going to pick one with some logic and reasoning behind it! Brighton play hosts to Bournemouth in this South Coast Derby and is surely the most logical pick available! 

Wigan vs Shrewsbury
Staying in England for this second pick and with an incredible lack of leagues playing this week, some selections are going to be a slight stretch to say the least. Here we head over to League 1 where we see first place Wigan graciously hosting second place Shrewsbury. Even with a loss here, Wigan would remain top, however going a further 3 points clear at the top would create a much harder task for Shrewsbury and give Wigan a little breathing space. Investing here is fairly straight forward, with the lack of gold cards available we should be aiming for discard silvers and if not, bronzes.  

Celtic vs Rangers
From England we travel up north for a few hours until we hit sunny Scotland! Now there are quite a few potential candidates from the Scottish Premier League this week, so narrowing it down to just the one became extremely difficult. So far, we are yet to see EA include two matches from a single league, and I am highly doubtful that this will change either. 
Anyhow, first up we have the biggest match in Scottish football, Celtic vs Rangers. Investments here provide options in gold, silver and bronze players; however, one team has a lot less gold cards than the other, use this to your advantage! 

Hearts vs Hibernian
As mentioned above, there is a rather large handful of possible matches from the SPL this week, and due to this we have not one, but two possible choices featuring in these predictions! This time we have the Edinburgh derby where Hearts play hosts to Hibernian. When it comes to investing, you are going to be looking at bronze/silver cards so make sure you are not overpaying!  
Remember, we have 2 games from the SPL this week, invest where you personally feel is best! 

Al Nassr vs Al Ahli 
Once again, we may be stretching our selections here a little but with so few games to choose from and EA's pure randomness, we need to take a couple of gambles with our investments. Don't we? Anyhow, heading over to Saudi Arabia now where first place Al Ahli are away to third place Al Nasr. This is a league we haven't seen feature in a long time on FUT and while an outsider, it carries a lot of potential profits if it somehow sneaks in. Investments here are going to once again focus around silver/bronze cards, so when it comes to buying, discard, discard, discard! 

Inter Milan vs Lazio
Finally, we head over to the Serie A where we find two of the top teams in the league, Inter Milan and Lazio, going head to head. Inter currently sit in third, just a couple of points from top, while Lazio are in 5th and a whole 9 points away from the top. Investments here are simple once more, it’s a big league, these are huge teams and hence discard gold cards are always going to be the correct selection."

The FUTBIN Team"
Import My Club,30-Dec-17 11:24,"As many of you are aware, the FUTBIN Import Chrome extension was removed from the Chrome store in the middle of November and the web pages associated with it were disabled. We decided to take this step as EA updated their TOS, and we wanted to ensure that nobody’s accounts were put at risk (Link to EA Rules).  Since then, we have been working on a completely new extension, an extension we can confidently say, breaks no TOS. This extension was finalized mid-December and after extensive testing, it is finally ready to go live.
So how can we be sure the new extension does not break EA rules? The answer is simple, as since the new extension does not send requests to the EA servers, there are no TOS being broken. The new extension reads the data that comes back from the EA servers (the data that contains the information about the players and consumables in your club), thereby avoiding sending any requests itself to the EA servers.
Some have stated that an extension is a violation in itself to EA TOS. This however is not true. EA TOS has a smaller piece on extensions:
“We don’t want you to use third party apps and browser extensions because it puts your account at risk. When you use these third-party apps and browser extensions, your login info can be visible to third parties and someone could use that info to take over your account. Browser extensions can capture your passwords, track your web browsing, insert ads into web pages you visit, and more.”
This section recommends not using extensions, since they are a security risk. And yes, a developer with bad intentions can easily use an extension to gain access to your FUT account, if it reads the keys associated with your account. Naturally, the FUTBIN extension does not read these keys, but you should only use an extension if you trust the company/site that has developed it!! So to clarify: using an extension is NOT a violation to the EA rules IF the extension itself follows the EA TOS.

Bear in mind though, that while the FUTBIN extension does not violate the current EA TOS, we cannot foresee future updates to EA’s TOS.
 
Happy “importing” 
The FUTBIN Team"
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,21-Apr-18 20:09,"With so many possible matches to pick from last week, investing with confidence was always going to be a challenge. Sadly, this week we are also faced with this dilemma, as once again we have the possibility of both Champions League and Europa League matches being included within the line-up.
Spreading the risk by preparing for both routes will reduce any potential loses, while maximising your chances of success with this week’s marquee matchups.

European Cup Matches

Liverpool vs Roma
As a Liverpool fan, simply reaching the semi-finals is a fantastic achievement, but when we then consider the real possibility of making the final, my excitement is taken to another level. The first semi-final consists of Liverpool and Roma, the two underdogs remaining in the competition and if the quarter-finals represent the quality we could see here, then we are in for one hell of a treat. Investments are simple, aim for gold players of a stronger rating, however aim to keep them as close to discard as possible.

Bayern Munich vs Real Madrid
The second leg of the Champions League sees the current holders, Real Madrid, travel to the German champions Bayern Munich. As you would expect, the quality both teams have on offer is simply incredible and this will undoubtably be a masterclass in football. With the Champions League featuring so recently in marquee matchups, I remain a little pessimistic that we see these feature, although if we do, payday could be huge this week.

Arsenal vs Atlético Madrid
Over to the Europa League now and while Arsenal’s season has been far from perfect, the fact that they could still clinch Champions League football next year is a massive positive for their fans. Atlético Madrid on the other hand are having an incredible season in La Liga, and while they would have probably preferred to avoid Arsenal in the semi-finals, they still have to be considered favourites in my opinion. 

Marseille vs Salzburg
The second Europa League Match follows the trend created with the Champions League, both teams that would be considered underdogs facing off for a place in the final. Both Marseille and Salzburg have done incredibly well to get this far, and with the final in touching distance we can assume that neither side will be giving anything under 110%. Investments here follow the same trend as above, aim for gold, discard and the highest possible rating.

Guadalajara vs Toronto FC
The final game that falls into this category, is one that we mentioned last week. Guadalajara and Toronto FC face off in the CONCAF Champions League final and while the names may not be quite as large as those mentioned above, we can still safely expect one hell of a football match. If gold prices begin to rise, don’t be afraid to pick up silver, and if needed, even bronze players for discard here.

Domestic Games and Cup Matches

Galatasaray vs Besiktas
First up this week we have current league leaders Galatasaray playing host to second placed Besiktas. Now with just a single point separating the top three, anything but a win would massively hinder their chances of a league title, so with everything on the line, this game carries enough heat to possibly make the line-up. Investments are simple, gold and strong ratings, for discard prices.

Southampton vs Bournemouth
Next up we head over to England and the Premier League, where a relegation battling Southampton play hosts to Bournemouth in a clash towards the South coast of England. As far as I recall we haven’t seen any of these southern derbies feature this year, possibly this means it’s more likely to happen, or is it simply not exciting enough for EA to include?

Juventus vs Inter Milan
Over to Italy now where league leaders Juventus play hosts to Inter Milan. Now with Juventus being included a couple of ones recently, I find it hard to imagine them cropping up again here. This is EA though, so as usual, expect the unexpected and don’t rule this one out quite yet.

Ajax vs AZ Alkmaar
Second place Ajax play hosts to third place AZ Alkmaar this week, and while PSV have already won the league, back to back loses could still see Ajax slip down to third. Alkmaar will ensure they do everything in their power to provide the first loss and hence this game carries real significance. Investments on this game are once again simple, plenty of discard gold cards available for both teams here.
 
Celtic vs Rangers
Next up is a game that always provides plenty of hype and usually rises prices regardless of whether we actually expect it to feature or not. Within two weeks of their Scottish Cup Mach, Celtic and Rangers meet again for the “Old Firm” Derby. Investments here should be bought at discard and to reduce risk, sold into the hype.
 
Tigres vs Monterrey
Mexico is our next stop, where we find Tigres playing hosts to Monterrey in the “Clasico Regiomontano”. The rivalry is brought about due to the clubs being closely located and is sure to be full of fire. Investments here should carry enough discard golds to meet earlier demand with ease.

Djurgarden vs Hammarby
Our final selection for our domestic matches this week features the two Swedish clubs, Djurgarden and Hammarby. The rivalry carries its significance due to both sides being located in Stockholm and with only bronze and silver cards available, this is another game that could generate some serious hype."
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,08-Dec-17 16:54,"This game-week proves difficult to make strong, actual predictions based of logic, history, rivalry or sheer importance. Like usual, we aren't going to start including games to simply make up the numbers or fill the page and with EA being so completely random with their selection process, anything could happen right now! It is important to remember we have a lot of cup matches coming up over the next week or so and while EA usually decide to leave these out, this could be when we start seeing them sneak into selections. 
 
Lyon vs Marseille
Our first game today sees us travel over to Ligue 1 for a derby known only as ""The Choc des Olympiques"". The fixture gets this title due to both sides having Olympique in their name. Investments here are fairly straight forward as both teams have plenty of gold cards available and due to the recent Ligue 1 SBC, supply should be a little more limited allowing larger profit margins on discard cards. 
 
Manchester City vs Tottenham
For our second pick today, we head back over to the Premier League and while this match may not be a derby, the size of both teams and importance of the match carry this selection into our predications. Last week we saw EA ignore both the Manchester and Merseyside derbies, so a return to the Premier League seems likely. Once again, plenty of gold card investments are available so aim for solid ratings, positions, nationality and most importantly prices. 
 
KS Cracovia vs Wisla Krakow
For our next pick we move over to the Polish league where we find Cracovia hosting Krakow in a battle known only as the Holy War. Again, we are referring to Wikipedia here, but apparently the rivalry came about due to the teams being the biggest in Krakow, while the name was given by a KS Cracovia defender named Ludwik Gintel. Investing here leaves us extremely limited while searching for gold players, however when we begin to jump down a tier or two, we have plenty of discard options! 
 
Sparta Rotterdam vs Feyenoord
Our next selection sees us head over to the Eredivisie, but before we jump into discussing this pick, it is important to note that a match from this league features in the current MM and hence this match immediately becomes a lot less likely. The Rotterdam derby, is the collective name given to any match between the three sides; Feyenoord, Sparta Rotterdam and Excelsior. Once more, investing is simple with a wide variety of gold cards available for all investors! 
 
Club Brugge vs Anderlecht
While our final pick today is once again not a derby by name, it certainly holds significant importance to the fans and carries a lot more weight than another simple league match. First place Club Brugge are hosts to the third placed Anderlecht in this Pro League match. When it comes down to investments there seem to be a variety of gold card options available, however if these begin to run dry, stay away from paying too much above discard and simply move down to silver players that tick this category."
Review - 84 IF Rashford,17-Mar-18 07:16,"Last weekend witnessed one of the most anticipated match ups of the Premier League season as Liverpool visited Manchester United in the latest installment of an age old rivalry.  The fact that the match would also determine second place in the league brought added excitement and pressure to the occasion.  While most twenty year olds try to figure out how to cook supper on their own, Marcus Rashford was scoring two goals to lift Manchester United above Liverpool and firmly into second place.  This performance earned Rashford a MUCH anticipated upgrade on his PTG Autumn card and an 84 rated IF.  Rashford enters into a LM/LW/LF position, which normally sees a mixture of Martial, Sane, and Son as the Premier League top choices.  The question is whether or not he can surpass these names?
In order to figure out the value of Rashford I purchased him Wednesday evening to get a mixture of games from the Daily Knockout Tournament, Seasons, and FUT Champs.  The DKT reward of a PTG Vela was the perfect trial by fire opportunity to see if Rashford could stand up against the FUT heavyweights.  I used him as the right and left ST in a 4-2-2-2 (in game team below), with the Marksman chemistry style.  Rashford completed the following team: 



EARLY DAYS
I tried to enter this review with a completely open mind.  I am aware of the abilities of Sane and Son in the LW position, likewise, I know that Martial’s price tag makes him a difficult comparison to live up to.  As Rashford was taking the place of Aubameyang in my squad I wasn’t expecting to see an increase in pace or shooting either.  What I immediately noticed that I didn’t expect was his size.  The man is a giant on the pitch.  I am not sure if it is the build, body type, or the way that he carries himself?  But immediately I felt like I had added a dimension of size and this directly translated to in-game success.  Diving into the review, I tried to focus on the 6 major areas with a rating out of 5.


PACE
The lad is obviously fast, but I wouldn’t call him quick.  Having used Aubameyang and 2POTM Salah I feel like I have played with a different level of pace compared to most players available.  Rashford did not meet these levels of quickness.  Rashford is more like a boulder teetering on the edge of a cliff, if you get him rolling then it is lights out.
RATING: 4.5/5


SHOOTING
The fact that Rashford was playing in the ST position put added scrutiny on his shooting.  Every chance missed was amplified and I felt myself wondering if I was jeopardizing games by playing a weaker player than I had on the bench.  But then I started to get a feeling for the type of player Rashford is.  Small cuts, turns, and skills were replaced with a simple turn and shoot mentality that turned into quite a decent goal return.  His 4 Star Weak Foot feels like it is a 4.9 and for some reason EA didn’t want to list him as a five.  As a long time FUT Manager I know each player and their preferred foot.  But I will be honest, I had to go and look Rashford up again on FUTBIN just to make sure that I hadn’t made a mistake.  As the video demonstrates I couldn’t miss with his left and even found myself moving to his left more often than not.   However, he still misses one too many chances in front of goal.
RATING: 4/5


PASSING
There is not a whole lot to say about Rashford’s passing.  He is not going to thread passes into tight spaces as a player with 90 passing stats can.  At the same time he is not going to “Bakayoko” a square ball ten feet behind your target and out of bounds.  He is a goal scorer, and for me, I don’t buy a hammer to drill holes.
RATING: 4/5


DRIBBLING
I feel like Rashford is Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde when it comes to dribbling.  At slower speeds Rashford is meticulous and composed like Doctor Jekyll; tight to the ball, big enough to shield opponents, strong enough to shake off would be tacklers, agile enough to tightly maneuver a corner and has a burst of pace to get a step to shoot.  At pace Rashford is as erratic and unpredictable as Mr. Hyde; sometimes he turns and cuts fine, other times it is like turning a cruise ship in shallow water.  There were times I would be dribbling and flick the joystick to gain some space and he would completely alter my touch to his liking.  While this worked in my favor a few times, for the most part it was frustrating to see chances pass by.
RATING: Doctor Jekyll 4/5  Mr. Hyde 2/5  =  3/5


DEFENDING
I would say this stat is irrelevant given his starting position in games.  However, I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of times I picked off opponents passes, or caught a wingback taking a bit too long on the ball.  In all honesty this card felt more agile and fluid on defense then attacking and I scored a few goals from his work off of the ball.  
RATING: 2/5


PHYSICAL
Probably the most disappointing category for me.  When you see a six foot ST with the athleticism that Rashford possess in real life you would hope that it translates into in game, stats, it doesn’t.  As I previously mentioned he appears as a giant on the screen and I immediately felt his 77 Strength was a non-issue.  His 88 Stamina does allow him to be effective for 70-80 minutes, but beyond that I felt he was running in quicksand and as a ST this was disappointing.  Finally, his 67 Jumping (77 with Marksman) is likely the reason that he only scored a single wide open header for me.  It was as if he was wearing weighted shoes as he jumped.  The 86 Heading Accuracy would suggest that if he did get on the end of the ball he could be effective.  However, I honestly did not win a header in the box or on a clearance against opposing defenders.  
RATING: 3.5/5


FINAL SCORE 
RATING: 3.8/5 
Removing the defensive rating and focusing on the attributes which complete a ST leaves Rashford with a very accurate 3.8 rating out of 5.  Before writing this article I thought about the games I played and right away my experiences suggested that Rashford is too good to be rated 3.5 out of 5, and not quite the complete 4.  By complete coincidence the numbers came out about perfect.  I will admit that Rashford brought elements to my team that Aubameyang does not and I really enjoyed the left footed strikes flying into the far top corner.  But is he worth the 100k price tag (as of writing) currently listed on the Xbox market? Unless you require an English winger for your squad, I would have to say no; it makes my fingers burn to say that you would be better off with Martial.  However, if you have the coins, patience, luck, and belief that Rashford could pull off one more IF performance before the end of the year; The 170k PTG is worth a shot in the dark.  Rashford could easily come off the bench for any FUT squad in the meant time and create havoc, chances, and goals.  The idea of a 2IF version of this card would be end game scary. Cheers for reading.
 
Game Stats:

 

Game Highlights:"
TOTW10 Predictions,20-Nov-17 18:13,"Starting Eleven
Zieler 
Stuttgart were hosts to Dortmund for their weekend fixture where in a tightly contested match, they just managed to steal the points. Zieler their goalkeeper was the star of show, with a total of 7 fantastic saves including one from the spot, he deserves his place in these predictions, even if they scored on the rebound!
Mustafi 
Arsenal played Tottenham in their weekend Derby and the result was one that shocked most. In a spectacular showing they almost seemed to cruise to a 2-0 victory over their rivals and Mustafi with a fantastic header to score the first and a clean sheet, is the one who takes the spot.
Naldo 
Schalke were hosts to Hamburg over in the Bundesliga, and due to some fantastic defensive displays they not only took the points but a clean sheet as well. Naldo was at the heart of this defence and while he may not have scored, his defensive showing was spectacular.
Ivanovic 
Zenit cruised to an easy 5-0 victory on the weekend and while there were plenty of fantastic performances, Ivanovic is the one who stood out to me. With a clean sheet, an assist and a goal, he ticks every requirement in my eyes.
Pastore 
It was only a matter of time until P2G cards starting making these predictions and this week sees our first! PSG beat Nantes 4-1 in their Ligue 1 match with Pastore scoring once and assisting another. There were plenty of strong performances this week, let's just hope this was enough.
Coutinho 
Liverpool picked up what seemed like an easy 3 points against Southampton on the weekend, and if Salah hadn't already had 2 special cards he would have been here too! Coutinho had an incredible game, assisting, scoring and just doing what Coutinho does best. He deserves this card.
Pogba 
In a 4-1 win over Newcastle, Manchester United looked like they had found their form again, and the return of players like Pogba really seemed to influence this. With a goal and an assist from midfield, we could be seeing one insane team of the week.
Nainggolan 
Roma were hosts to Lazio in this massive league game and it was the hosts who managed to just about close it out and secure those points. A fantastic performance from Nainggolan in the midfield secured dominance, while his goal was simply the icing on the cake.
Vidal 
Bayern cruised to an easy 3-0 victory over Augsburg in their Bundesliga match and with this we see yet another powerhouse squeeze into these predictions. With a goal and an assist from midfield, could Vidal add his name to this ever growing list of superstars?
Hazard 
Chelsea travelled to West Brom for their weekend fixture and this time the journey paid off. In a comfortable 4-0 win, Hazard from a CF slot managed to score twice. This TOTW simply has no limits.
Suarez 
As expected, Barcelona picked up an easy 3 points against Leganes in their La Liga game. Suarez was on form again, scoring twice and possibly giving us the highest rated card of these predictions!
 
Substitutes
Lukac 
Akhisarspor travelled to Benfica for their weekend fixture and despite the force of attack thrown at them, they managed to withstand it all. Besiktas managed a total of 22 shots which forced 6 saves from Lukac, including one from the spot.
Hoegh 
SC Heerenveen travelled to FC Twente for their weekend match, and once again it was the visitors who prevailed. In a dominating 4-0 victory, Hoegh not only ensured a clean sheet was kept but also managed to score one himself.
Ligt 
Ajax travelled to NAC Breda and I don't know what happened on that journey, but they were all kinds of crazy! In an 8-0 thrashing, Ligt from the CB spot kept that clean sheet and also buried 2 himself!
Beek 
The 8-0 win for Ajax was simply so big that we have not one, but two players who find themselves in these predictions. Beek pulled off an incredible 3 from a central midfield spot to all but guarantee he makes the cut!
Ferrari 
Sampdoria were hosts to the travelling Juventus in this weekend fixture and although the game looks close at 3-2, Juventus couldn't even score until the 90th+. With a dominant performance at CB and a goal to his name, Ferrari is my choice although a few others have chances for sure.
Isimat-Mirin 
PSV were the away side for their league fixture this weekend where an incredible performance from their CB secured all the points. Keeping a clean sheet and scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win has to give him a chance at least!
Malli 
Wolfsburg were hosts to Freiburg in this Bundesliga clash where the hosts pulled off a convincing 3-1 victory. Malli stole the show scoring twice from midfield and ensuring they took the points.
Wilson 
It's very difficult to ignore anyone who scores a hat trick when writing these predictions, and that's not going to change today. Bournemouth were comfortable winners against Huddersfield in their PL fixture and it was Wilson with 3 goals who shone the brightest. This one is surely a lock.
Adebayor 
Istanbul Basaksehir hosted Galatasaray for their match and with it we find our second hat trick of the predictions. Picking up 3 goals in a 5-1 thrashing, Adebayor is surely also taking home a shiny new inform card too.
Adriano 
Spartak Moscow were away to FC Krasnodar in this Russian league match and once again the journey paid off. In a comfortable 4-1 victory, Adriano not only scored twice but assisted the third, it's almost our third hat trick!
Kruse 
Werder Bremen were hosts to Hannover back in the Bundesliga where a comfortable 4-0 victory was secured. Kruse not only scored 3, but also assisted the fourth making it our most impressive hat trick so far!
Soldado 
Our final pick his week sees an old legend renter the picks. Not only did Soldado score 3 during this 4-1 victory, but he also managed it in half the time after coming on as a second half sub. The boys still got skills!"
TOTS Bundesliga Predictions,13-Apr-18 09:27,"Starting Eleven
Pavlenka
During these predictions, picking a goalkeeper has often proved to be somewhat of a difficult task, usually due to the lack of standout performances. With the Bundesliga however, we seem to have the complete opposite, there are a whole heap of goalkeepers who have had fantastic seasons. After much deliberation, our first spot goes to Pavlenka from Werder Bremen. With an average of 3.9 saves a game and despite Bremen being twelfth in the league only 33 goals conceeded, there is just no possible list of predictions I could imagine without this man.
Kimmich 
As most would probably assume, we are going to be seeing a lot of Bayern Munich players feature within these predictions, so let's start the ball rolling with Kimmich at right-back. When you look at Bayern's defensive record, it becomes no surprise that they currently sit almost 20 points clear at the top. With just 20 goals conceded so far in the league Kimmich has already proved his worth, but when we also consider his goal and 9 assists, then he becomes an absolute staple here.
Hummels
From one Bayern defender to another now as we move onto Mats Hummels. Now we have already spoken about just how solid Bayern were at the back and with just a single goal and assist, Hummels doesn't jump off the page as an attacking threat either, so what exactly made Hummels all that much more impressive this year? With Neuer out for basically the whole season, Bayern needed someone to stand up and take control of the back line. Hummels showed his qualities as a leader and also showed just how incredible he is as an individual too.
Naldo
Schalke are having an absolutely incredible campaign so far, second in the league and well on their way to Champions League football next year. With just 43 goals scored, their goal-scoring record is far from sensational, however with just 30 goals conceded they show their strength defensively more than makes up for this. Not only has Naldo been critical to Schalke's defensive line, but he has also proven himself a threat going forward. Scoring 5 goals and assisting a further two in the league this season, Naldo storms into our starting eleven here.
Max 
Max is a player that hasn’t received nearly enough attention this season. Augsburg currently sit comfortably in the middle of the table and while they may not be pushing for league titles or European qualification quite yet, there are definitely some superstars in the making. With 37 goals scored and 36 goals conceded, Max has played a part in both the defensive and attacking duties for his side. Racking up a total of 12 assists and even a goal from his fullback position, it becomes baffling that he is yet to receive a special card, but surely TOTS will be when his hard work finally pays off.
James 
After a difficult patch during his time at Real Madrid, and falling out of favor with new boss Zidane, James was allowed to go out on loan this year, with Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich the destination of choice. After a fairly slow start to the season, James quickly found himself playing regularly and soon became an absolute staple in Bayern's starting eleven. With 5 goals, 9 assists and 4 man of the match awards from just 18 games, he has proven all doubters wrong and is totally deserving of his spot within these predictions.
Vidal 
From one Bayern midfielder to another now, as we find this Chilean superstar up next on our list. Now Bayern have scored an incredible 72 goals this season and only conceded 20 and while some players contribute defensively and others are more attacking minded, you also have a utility category that fits Vidal perfectly. Whether locking down the midfield, making a crunching tackle, picking out that pinpoint pass or even slotting one home, Vidal undertakes his role with quality. His 6 goals and 2 assists only add to this marvel and while some may say his 6 yellow cards show a lack of professionalism, I simply see it as passion!
Keita
With a big money move secured for the summer, it would have been easy for Keita to simply switch off and ignore his responsibilities for Leipzig, and even though this is what many believe to have happened, his stats suggest otherwise. Leipzig currently sit in sixth, and while they fall just shy of another Champions League run for next year, the season is far from over and things can certainly change. His match ratings have been consistently solid and when we couple this with the 5 goals and 5 assists he has provided in the league, we find ourselves with a real candidate here.
Bailey 
As we come into the final stretch of games this year, Leverkusen have given themselves a real fighting chance of securing Champions League football next season. Sitting just three points behind third place, a solid run of matches would see them jump the competition and when they have young superstars like Bailey in their arsenal, anything becomes possible. With 9 goals and 4 assists across the season, Bailey has contributed to roughly 30% of Leverkusen's goals and if this is what he is capable of at just 20 years old, then this kid has a bright future.
Muller 
Over the past couple of seasons Muller has received a lot of criticism for not quite living up to expectations, but with his transition into a central attacking midfield and success in the role, perhaps he was simply never being utilized to the best of his ability. We have spoken about Bayerns success numerous times already within this article, but with 7 goals and 9 assists alongside his constant string of top tier performances, Muller deserves all the recognition he can get.
Lewandowski 
Onto our final selection for this starting eleven and this man is somebody who is simply impossible to exclude. With rumours flying around that this could be his final year at Bayern, and that clubs such as Real Madrid are in the hunt for this Polish superstar, he has shown absolutely no signs of losing his focus and seems more driven than ever. From Bayern's 72 goals, Lewandowski has scored over 30% of them with 26 and already has the golden boot in his grasp. Whether he stays or leaves next season is irrelevant, all that matters is that we see his TOTS card on FIFA soon.
 
Substitutes
Hradecky
Onto the substitutes and reserves now and first up we have yet another goalkeeper who has been absolutely incredible this season. Frankfurt are having an absolutely incredible season so far, they currently sit in fifth and with a handful of games still remaining, Champions League football is not out of the equation. Hradecky has been a critical part of this success, with an average of 2.7 saves a game and with only 33 goals conceded across the season, he takes our second goalkeeper spot in these predictions.
Sane 
Hannover currently sit way down the table in 13th place and despite a fairly average record this season, this man has been an absolute diamond in the rough. As a soul defender there is only so much a person can do, but the stats and figures attached to this man shows his willingness to go above and beyond. With 3 goals, 1 assist and 7 man of the match awards, Sane shows his talent and drive and hence is well deserving of his spot in these Bundesliga picks.
Ginter 
Next up in these predictions is the 24-year-old center-back from Gladbach, Ginter. With three informs already on FIFA, we can tell that EA like this man and when we look at his contributions to all aspects of the game, we simply have to agree. Alongside his defensive duties, Ginter manages to find room to contribute to the attack as well and with 5 goals and 2 assists in the league so far, I think we could see him with a shiny new blue card in a matter of weeks.
Kramaric
Hoffenheim currently sit seventh in the table, just outside the European cup spots. However, with just six points separating them and third place Dortmund, anything is possible in these final games. Players such as Kramaric have been a huge part of this incredibly strong season and with 52 goals scored, they show no signs of slowing down. Kramaric himself has scored 9 and assisted 5 of these and when we consider he has only started 16 games and made a further 12 appearances as a substitute, it becomes all that more impressive as well.
Bender 
Next up we have one of two twins who play for Leverkusen, one of the Bender brothers. Lars is the man who gets the nomination this year, after having dominated the midfield for Leverkusen across the season. Defensively he has been an absolute animal, closing down plays left, right and center, while during the attack he has also contributed to a total of 5 goals, finishing 2 himself and assisting a further 3.
Gregoritsch
Next up we head over to Augsburg, another side sitting comfortably in a mid-table position and while we had two strong candidates here, Gregortisch just steals the spot from Finnbogason. As an attacking midfielder you expect a player to contribute to goals on a regular basis, and this is exactly what Gregortisch has done. With 11 goals and 2 assists, he boosts stats that would be expected of a striker and with Augsburg having scored 38 goals so far this year, he has played a part in over 30% of them.
Goretzka 
Now this was a difficult decision, and one that I am still not completely comfortable with. Goretzka has an incredible start to the season, but when compared to others, he appears to have significantly tailed off as the year progressed. Having only started 16 games this season, with a total of just 4 goals and 2 assists, his stats alone just simply aren't enough for him to break into this line-up, however when we take into account just how popular he is and that the Bundesliga TOTS was fan voted last year, I think we may be seeing this man included.
Caligiuri 
Back to Schalke now where we find a man who has started almost every game for his side this season. Schalke have had a phenomenal season so far, currently sitting second behind Bayern and with a fantastic chance of Champions League football next season. With a total of 45 goals scored to date, Caligiuri has been a fundamental part of this success, playing a part of roughly 25% of these with 5 goals, 6 assists and an incredible average match rating across the season.
Uth 
Hoffenheim have had a fairly successful season to date, currently sitting in seventh place and within a chance of European football next year. With 53 goals scored in their campaign so far, Hoffenheim as a unit have been incredible in front of goal and when you consider that Uth has played a vital role in 18 of these goals, you realise just how incredible he has been this season. With a total of 12 goals and 6 assists, he creeps into these predictions.
Fullkrug 
We breifly touched on Hannover's season earlier in these predictions and while they may not have had an incredible season as a unit, some players have been nothing short of sensational. Fullkrug falls into this category, with 11 goals and 2 assists he proves that a top striker will continue to strive and find the back of the net, even if the team is struggling.
Werner 
Leipzig were always going to struggle when attempting to compete with last year's majestic performance, especially after losing some of their key players. Having said this, they have gone out and put up one hell of a fight, currently sitting 6th in the league and within touching distance of yet another Champions League run. Werner was once again a critical part of this setup, providing 11 goals and 5 assists throughout the campaign.
Petersen 
Our final nomination for the Bundesliga falls on a 29 year old, German striker named Petersen. Now Freiburg aren't far from the relegation zone, sitting on just 30 points, with a total of 48 goals conceded. Their attacking record is even less impressive with just 26 goals scored, however when you consider that Petersen played a part in over 50% of them, you realize just how important he was. With 13 goals and an assist, Petersen was a shining light and has hopefully helped his side remain in the top tier of German football.

POTM August - Potential Investments,25-Sep-17 18:22,"FIFA 17 was a fantastic year for ultimate team players with EA introducing a whole heap of new features. SBC's were one of the key additions, allowing players to obtain additional packs, players or simply coins through investment on a regular basis. 
The PL POTM was a challenge we saw throughout the year, a 3/4 part SBC rewarding packs for each challenge and a premium POTM card for completing the group. Last year Raheem Sterling won the August POTM award and hence was the first challenge we saw released. If EA are to follow this pattern throughout FIFA 18, then Sadio Mane will be the first to drop, having already won the August award.
Now this puts us in a fantastic position. Provided we believe that this SBC we repeat itself again this year, we can use the template of last years challenges to predict what the SBC could involve. Whether we plan on finishing the challenge, parts of it or even just simply investing to make some coins, there is some value to be found. 

August POTM 2016 - Raheem Sterling
With the game new, the market fresh and players coin totals being fairly low on average, EA would find it difficult to overprice the first POTM challenge. A prime example of this is the SBC we received for Sterling last year.

Manchester City
Manchester City Players: Min 11
Overall Team Rating: Min 81
Overall Team Chemistry: Min 100

Fairly straight forward here. They took the club of the winning player and then required a squad consisting of 11 players from it.

Premier League
Premier League Players: Min 11
Rare Gold Players: Min 11
Overall Team Rating: Min 83
Overall Team Chemistry: Min 100

The league in which Sterling plays (obviously), and where he has always played. The rating is a little higher here simply because there were so many more options for usable players.

England
English Players: Min 11
Overall Team Rating: Min 81
Overall Team Chemistry: Min 100

Finally we saw his nationality come into play. A full squad consisting of players only from England. A rating of 81 is in line with the availability of higher rated English players.


August POTM 2017 - Sadio Mane
The first thing we need to take into account is that Mane has a higher rated base card than Sterling had last year. This in turn will ensure that the reward card has a higher rating than that of last year and hence will likely make the challenge that little bit more expensive. Obviously we are unable to know exactly what the SBC will entail, but what we can do is look at some of the possibilities.
All ratings and squads are ideas only, nothing is confirmed and hence nothing is guaranteed.

Liverpool
Liverpool Players: Min 11
Overall Team Rating: Min 81
Overall Team Chemistry: Min 100

First up is Mane's current club, Liverpool. While being widely supported across the world, the amount of higher rated players available is definitely on the lower side. It's possible to create an 82/83 rated squad, however we would be using a lot of big, expensive players, players that will be in low supply so early into the game.

Premier League
Premier League Players:  Min 11
Overall Team Rating: 84/85
Overall Team Chemistry: 100

Next up we have the premier league. Now with the wide variety of players available, the lack of rating available from his club and the fact that his card could be 86 rated, there is a strong chance that we could be seeing an 84/85 rated team requirement here if used. If investing, make sure you cover any potential formation they decide to through at us!

Past Clubs
Ligue 1 - FC Metz
Austrian Bundesliga - Red Bull Salzburg
Premier League - Southampton 

This was a feature we saw pop up throughout challenges last year. The requirements would often base themselves around clubs that the winner had previously played for. Sometimes we get lucky, and the player had just one previous club, or they were from the same league. This time however Mane has three previous clubs, from three different leagues.
Once again, there is no guarantee any of these will be included, but while we can buy players for discard there is no harm in preparing.

Senegal
Players From Senegal: Min 11
Overall Team Rating: 75-78
Overall Team Chemistry: 100

Nationality was a favourite from EA last year, and there is no apparent reason this should change in FIFA 18. The lack of gold Senegalese players means we would have to dip into the silver and bronze markets, which immediately reduced any possible rating requirements. 
There is always a chance that they use this, but only require a small amount of Senegalese players, but however you believe it could pan out will shape any investments you make.

August Opponents
Players From X: Min 2
Overall Team Rating: Min 81
Overall Team Chemistry: Min 100

Mane won the award during the month of August and hence having a challenge based around the teams he played is possible. 
In August Liverpool played against Watford, Crystal Palace and Arsenal. A team consisting of 1/2 players from each of these clubs alongside a chemistry and rating requirement isn't something to rule out.

Sadio Mane
Liverpool Players: Min 1
Players From Senegal: Min 1

A bit of a long shot here, but we have seen it included previously. The challenge was used last year for the likes of Ibrahimovic and required just the one player, the man himself. 
Being so early into the cycle and noting the lack of cards available on the market this seems unlikely, but was worth a mention in an attempt to cover all bases.

Special Cards

Just like the use of Mane himself, the need for special cards seems like a fairly unlikely scenario. Last year as the year progressed, informs became a common occurrence with such challenges, but with the game being new and the distinct lack of them available it seems highly unlikely for now.
 
Final Thoughts
Be wary that while we can attempt to predict these, we can never be sure and hence no investments are without risk. We also need to keep in mind that even if we guess the requirements, other items such as formations could catch us off guard, make sure you prepare for such situations when picking up players!"
TOTW14 Predictions,18-Dec-17 18:07,"Starting Eleven
Ulreich 
Back to the Bundesliga now where we find Bayern away to Stuttgart. In a match that seemed to have only one outcome, the hosts put in a fantastic performance, making Bayern work for every opportunity and chance. In the end Bayern managed to edge the game as 1-0 victors, but this was only after their goalkeeper managed to pull off a couple of great saves, including one from the spot.
Sokratis 
Dortmund have been struggling across every area of the pitch recently, so much so that a new manager appeared to be the only option. Fresh off the back of this change, they appear to have almost instantly found some kind of form again and with a 2-0 victory away to Mainz, the points are starting to add up. Sokratis was the man of the hour this time, not only did he ensure the clean sheet but also scored one of the goals.
Lovren 
After a couple of disappointing draws, Liverpool travelled to Bounemouth where the only acceptable outcome was all three points. Luckily the entire team rose to the challenge and fantastic performances from almost every attacking player secured a 4-0 victory. With Coutinho recently featuring in a team of the week, Firmino in the TOTGS and Salah as the POTM, the default selection here falls onto Lovren. Scoring once, with a diving header we should add, and securing a clean sheet, should be enough to see him squeeze into this week's team.
Aurier 
Tottenham were hosts to Brighton in their first league match last week and despite they rocky form recently, this time they were prepared. Putting forward a solid performance with both the defense and attack, we saw them pick up all the points in a 2-0 win. The one player who stood out this time was their new signing Aurier at RB, keeping a clean sheet and also scoring one of the goals.
Fabinho 
Monaco travelled to Saint-Etienne for their Ligue 1 fixture this week and this time the journey was definitely worth it. In a 4-0 thrashing we were not left short of possible team of the week candidates, however Fabinho from the holding position is the player who just edges the others out. With a solid performance defensively, he also proved he could do the same going forward. Scoring once, assisting another and picking up the man of the match, this could be a fantastic card if it happens.
Pjanic 
Over to the Serie A now where Juventus were away to Bologna. As most would expect, it was the away side who pulled off a fairly comfortable 3-0 win and while the goals were spread, there was one player who just edges it for these predictions. With a goal, an assist and a solid showing from the midfield, Pjanic could be on his way to a second inform, and just in time for Christmas.
Silva 
Manchester City are absolutely flying this season and things were not going to change when they travelled to Swansea for their mid-week fixture. Picking up a comfortable 4-0 victory, it was once again their Spanish playmaker David Silva who stole the show. Scoring twice and dominating the match, hopefully he has done enough for a second inform here.
Willian 
Chelsea travelled to Huddersfield for their Tuesday night fixture, and with Bakayoko scoring the first, the entire FIFA community began to fear that the end was near. Luckily Willian had different plans and in a comfortable 3-1 victory, was included in all of the goals. Scoring once and assisting the other two, Willian was clearly the man of the match and with a little luck has secured a spot in this team of the week too.
Neymar 
With Neymar recently featuring in the TOTGS, a second special card so soon is usually frowned upon. However, he is yet to actually secure an inform this season and with such a dominating display on the weekend, it becomes almost impossible to exclude him from this lineup. PSG were away to Rennes for their Ligue 1 match and in a dominant 4-1 victory, Neymar was a part of each and every goal. Scoring twice and assisting the other two, surely it becomes irrelevant that he was in the TOTGS and his first inform is just around the corner.
Suarez 
Finally, after months of waiting, it looks like we could be seeing our first Suarez inform of the season. Barcelona were hosts to Deportivo for their La Liga clash, and in a 4-0 thrashing there were two players who really stood out. With 2 goals each, Paulinho and Suarez stole the show, and while two goals from a CM would usually get the nod here, with the FUTMAS leaks in full swing, and Paulinho featuring, Suarez gets the nod for this week's predictions.
Raffael 
Borussia M.Gladbach were hosts to Hamburg for this Friday night Bundesliga clash and with mesmerizing efforts from the home teams attack, they left with all the points. In a 3-1 win, two players really stood out, Hazard from LW and also Raffael from the ST position. The prediction spot goes to Raffael, with 2 goals and an assist, however his fairly recent inform could see Hazard steal this spot from under his nose.
 
Substitutes
Nicolas 
Over to the Serie A for our first substitute spot and we find a relegation battling Verona play host to an almighty AC Milan. Against all the odds, Verona not only managed to win the game, but they did so with style, pulling off a comfortable 3-0 victory. Now while on paper it may look like a walk over, this was largely down to an incredible performance from their goalkeeper, Nicolas. With a total of 8 saves, he ensured that the clean sheet remained intact and that his team took home all the points.
Epureanu 
Over to the Super Lig now where we see Istanbul Basaksehir play hosts to Antalyaspor. In a dominant 4-1 victory for the hosts, it was their CB, Epureanu who shone the brightest. Although he wasn't quite able to secure that clean sheet, he did score twice, which for a CB is almost always enough!
Robinson 
Over to the Championship now were a QPR travelled to a struggling, bottom of the table Birmingham. In a tightly fought match, fans were made to wait until the 83rd minute for a winner to be found as QPR secured the points in a 2-1 victory. Playing a 3atb formation usually suggests that the defense is forced to refrain from pushing forward, but Robinson wasn't interested in tradition. Scoring both goals and putting in a solid defensive display, hopefully he has done enough to earn this spot.
Gundogan 
With Manchester City in such incredible form at the moment, with each passing game it is almost impossible to not select one of their players for the team of the week. Thanks to this, we see two City players squeezing into the predictions this week, Silva from the midweek game and Gundogan from the 4-1 thrashing of Spurs on the weekend. With a goal and an assist, and with other City players already having numerous informs, hopefully we see this German obtain his first special card of the year.
Pizzi 
Over to Portugal now, where Benficia were away to Tondela in their Liga Nos Clash. Once again, as most would have expected, it was the favorites who rose as comfortable winners. Picking up a 5-1 victory, Pizzi was the real star of the evening, scoring twice and assisting a third and with this, surely securing his spot in this week's team.
Saymak 
We head over to Holland now where PEC Zwolle travelled to Willem II for their Eredivisie fixture. In a 5-goal thriller, it was the away team who managed to just edge the victory in a 3-2 win, and it was their CM, Saymak, who stole the show. Scoring twice and dominating the midfield, hopefully this performance will secure him his first inform of the season.
Vilhena 
Feyernoord travelled to Sparta Rotterdam for their Sunday fixture, and it was a game that had only one outcome. In a 7-0 thrashing there are plenty of potential candidates for the team of the week, however the selection this week falls on their CM, Vilhena. With 2 goals and a dominant performance from the midfield, hopefully this will be enough to see him squeeze in, if not, somebody else from this match is surely nailed on.
Babel 
Staying in the Super Lig here and we find Besiktas at home to the travelling Osmanlispor FK. In an absolute 5-1 thrashing, one man really stands out for Besiktas, scoring not one, not two, but three of the goals and securing himself a hat-trick. Babel from the left was the clear man of the match and with this has managed to secure a spot in these predictions.
Kalou 
Hertha Berlin were hosts to Hannover for this Tuesday night Bundesliga clash and they made sure that the home advantage came into play. Picking up a comfortable 3-1 victory, it was their LM Kalou who really stood out, scoring twice and putting in a solid performance across the whole 90 minutes.
Mackay-Steven 
In the Scottish Premiership we saw Aberdeen play hosts to Hibernian for their Saturday fixture, and in a 4-1 thrashing there was only ever one possible winner. The real stand out superstar this time was their left winger, Mackay-Steven, bagging himself a hat-trick and surely securing his spot in this week's team.
Okazaki 
Leicester were away to Southampton for their first game of the week and after the long journey down south, they appeared to be ready for anything. In a fantastic 4-1 victory, it was their CF Okazaki who stole the show. Scoring twice and assisting a third should see him cruise into the lineup.
Siebatcheu 
From a hat-trick in the Scottish Premier League straight into another from the French second division now, where Reims were hosts to Valenciennes. In a dominant 5-1 victory, it was Siebatcheu who shone the brightest, scoring 3 and putting in nothing short of a flawless performance."
Review - Aubameyang (90 rated),08-Apr-18 06:14,"February.  Two packs into the OTW Untradeable SBC, a Gabonese flag appeared and I experienced the best pack pull in my FUT career.  Two painful months of watching subpar performances have now finally past and 90 rated Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang arrived in the latest installment of the TOTW.  I was hopeful he would be worth the wait.
I have previously used Aubameyang as a super sub and so his stats are quite good for 45 minute or less appearances.  However, I do not think I can leave him on the bench any longer.  After the TOTW release I used Aubameyang in the DKT, Online Season Matches, and a few Weekend League matches.  Auba led the line in the following squad (in game):


 
PACE
Not quite 99, but I can’t imagine players can move much faster.  He pulls away from defenders on and off the ball.  If speed kills, Auba is the lethal injection for your opponents.
RATING: 5/5
 
SHOOTING
Auba’s 4 STAR WEAK FOOT has always been his second best attribute behind his pace.  Prior to this inform I would have said that Auba’s shooting is excellent and his weak foot is really good.  Now.  This card comes equipped with dual stingray missiles that target and destroy opponent’s nets.  It has been 50/50 right and left footed goals and this gives defenders nightmares.  Equipped with FINISHER chemistry style he is lethal; 98 PACE, 97 SHOOTING, 21 Games, 29 Goals, and 18 Assists as of now. 
RATING: 5/5 
 
DRIBBLING & PASSING
After you are done drooling over Auba’s pace, shooting, and flawlessly executed front flips there is a massive drop off in stats.  On the surface his 85 DRIBBLING with 80 AGILITY and 73 BALANCE is not ideal. Previously Auba was like driving a Ferrari on bald tires and could be quite frustrating. Whatever stat increase turned him into the F1 car he is now I don’t know, nor do I care.  I couldn’t believe the difference.  Tight turns were responsive, even at pace, causing loads of issues for my opponents.  As for passing, he always found the targets I wanted and really he is the one you want on the end of through balls anyway.
RATING: 4.5/5
 
PHYSICAL
Defense stats are irrelevant here.  I wouldn’t play him in a position with those responsibilities.  FINISHER again plays a part in this category and boosts Auba to 94 JUMPING and 89 STRENGTH.  At 6’1 with a tall and strong body type it just adds to the threat this card is all around. The only physical stat of concern is 81 STAMINA.  Yes, he is a ST and his work rates lend themselves to reduced running.  However, the last 10 minutes you can see and feel a drop off in his running and extra time usually warrants a substitution.
RATING: 4.5/5
 
FINAL SCORE
RATING: 4.7/5
Two words.  End game.  While my video demonstrates how lethal Auba is, it does not contain the numerous tap-ins he had from being in the right spots in front of goal.  Auba is a magnet for the ball and it was nice to benefit from his positioning throughout the weekend.  I cannot overstate the amount he added to my attack this weekend.  Like Carlos Tevez in a prison football match, he doesn’t take it easy.  He is a full throttle attacker and constantly trying to find gaps and avoid defenders, the same way Spanish footballers try to avoid taxes.  On a serious note, I am sat here trying to figure out a FUT Manager who couldn’t use Auba as a ST and I can’t.  If you cross the ball, he is amazing in the air.  Long shots, absolutely. Pace depended and through balls, 100%.  Tiki-Taka? You have a two footed finisher at the end of your moves; still good. This card was worth the wait.  He is the most complete forward I have used in FIFA 18 and this card will definitely not be leaving my squad any time soon.  
Cheers for reading.
 
Game Stats:
(21 Games, 29 Goals, and 18 Assists as 90 rated OTW)


Game Highlights:"
TOTW 35 Predictions,14-May-18 17:48,"Starting Eleven
Shunin 
First up this week is a big Russian derby, featuring two sides from Moscow. Spartak and Dinamo went head to head and in a game that provided only a single goal, it was the visitors, Dinamo, who took the points. Shunin was absolutely breathtaking between the sticks, commanding his defence and pulling off 9 fantastic saves to secure the clean sheet.
Marcano 
Porto were away to Vitoria De Guimaraes for their weekend fixture, and in a game that provided just a single goal, it was the visitors who took all the points. Marcano was fantastic at the back, defensively solid and in control throughout, while he showed his ability going forward as well, scoring the games only goal.
Albiol 
Napoli may have recently blown their chances of taking the Italian crown from Juventus, however this doesn’t stop them finishing the season in style. Napoli were on the road to Sampdoria this week, and after a comfortable 90 minutes, they left as 2-0 winners. Albiol was the man of the match, solid at the back, while also scoring one of the goals.
Sigurdsson 
Over to Russia again now, where F.C. Rostov played host to Ural for their league fixture. Once again, it was a game with only a single goal, and this time it went in favour of the hosts. Now while Sigurdsson may not have scored, he was absolutely brilliant throughout, the core of the team, and this nomination is thoroughly deserved.
Guilavogui 
Over the Germany now, where Wolfsburg played hosts to F.C. Cologne, in a game that provided 5 goals. Sadly for the already relegated Cologne, 4 of these went against them, with the match ending 4-1. Guilavogui was sensational in the midfield, running rampant around the opposition, while also providing a goal and an assist too.
Lanzini 
Next up we head over to England, where the final games of the season took place. West Ham ensured they ended the season on a high, with a 3-1 win over Everton and while there were plenty of standout performances, we believe it’s Lanzini who deserves the nomination here. With two goals to his name, could a second Inform be on the cards?
Sane 
Manchester City have already been crowned champions of England, but coming into their final two games, it was all about just how many records they could set. Mid-week they had Brighton, and in a 3-1 victory Sane really stood out with 3 assists. The only other option I can see, is Jesus, for scoring that final goal on the weekend to take City to 100 points.
Thauvin 
After missing out on the player of the year award on the weekend, Thauvin may be feeling a little disheartened. Did he deserve it? Possibly, however anybody toppling Neymar was always going to be a difficult challenge. His chance of an Inform however is present, as although Marseille drew 3-3 on the weekend, it was 2 goals and an assist from Thauvin that got them the point
Dembele
Just in case you thought our last decision was a little risky, we move onto a second Barcelona player, destroying all rules and beliefs you may have once held! We move onto their midweek game now, where they were comfortable 5-1 winners over Villarreal. Dembele was a huge part of this, with 2 goals and the man of the match award. It may have taken the whole season, but could we finally be seeing an upgrade this week?
Bale
We find ourselves moving from two Barcelona players, to their bitter rivals, Real Madrid, for our next selection. Now while the La Liga TOTS is in packs, plenty of big names failed to make the cut, however it’s never too late to get their name in lights! Real Madrid picked up a comfortable 6-0 win over Celta Vigo, and with 2 goals, Bale is our nomination here.
Salah 
It’s tough to imagine yet another special card for Salah, yet after he broke the record for most goals scored in a 38 game campaign on the weekend, it’s also tough to imagine him not getting one. With a goal and an assist during Liverpool’s 4-0 win over Brighton, Salah was once again brilliant. However, if he somehow misses out, I fully expect to see Robertson take his spot here.
 
Substitutes
Melia 
Over to America for our first substitute selection, and Kansas were on the road to Atlanta. It was far from smooth sailing for the visitors and even though they picked up a 2-0 win, without Melia in goal, the result could have been very different. With 8 saves, a clean sheet and a fantastic performance throughout, he has secured his space amongst this week’s nominees.
Ellis 
Staying in the MLS here, where Chicago were hosts to Montreal in a game that once again, provided just the single goal. Chicago left the match as 1-0 winners, while Ellis was the hero on the day. Not only did he help secure the clean sheet, but he was also the provider of the match winning goal.
Lima 
Over to France now, where Nantes were on the road to Angers. It looks like the journey paid off this time, as the visitors left with all 3 points during a comfortable 2-0 win. Lima at the back was fantastic throughout, providing a clean sheet, a goal and our nomination for a team of the week spot.
Erokhin 
Over to Russia for this selection, and while Zenit’s 6-0 win over SKA-Khabarovsk was impressive, when we look at one individuals personal stats, things get a lot more exciting. Erokhin, from the midfield, not only provided an assist, but also scored 4 of the 6 goals. If this doesn’t earn him an Inform, well, I’m done trying to predict them!
Lewerenz 
From one man who scored four to another now, as we approach the second German League. Holstein Kiel were 6-2 victors over Eintracht Braunschweig during their fixture, and Lewerenz was the man in form. Scoring 4 goals and dominating the match, surely this man is also a lock this week.
Donis 
From the second German Division to the first now, where we find League Champions Bayern playing host to a travelling Stuttgart. Surprisingly, this game didn’t go as most predicted, with Stuttgart leaving as 4-1 victors. There were several fantastic performances, however our nomination goes with the man of the match, Donis. With 1 goal, 1 assist and a dominating showing from start to finish, hopefully he has done enough here.
Mount 
Vitesse were on the road this week, as they travelled to ADO Den Haag, for a 7 goal thriller. It looks like he journey was worthwhile here, as the visitors emerged as 5-2 winners, talking all the points back home with them. Mount was absolutely unstoppable, playing a part in four of the five goals scored. With 1 assist and 3 goals, hopefully his hard work will receive the recognition it deserves.
Perez 
Back across to the Premier League now, and despite an incredibly bumpy start to the season, Newcastle ended on quite the high. With performances improving throughout the year, Newcastle finished off their return with a 3-0 win over Chelsea, ending any Champions League dreams they may have had. Perez was in absolutely incredible form, scoring twice and running rampant amongst a lacking Chelsea defence.
Boateng 
Onto the strikers now, and we have already see a player from this match feature within our predictions. Now while Coutinho made the cut with a hat-trick, we have to remember that Barcelona actually lost, so a hat-trick for someone on the winning side, is almost certainly guaranteed an Inform, especially when it ruins an unbeaten season for league winners Barcelona. Boateng was brilliant, causing all kinds of trouble and surely cementing his name amongst this week’s line-up.
Braithwaite
Back across to France now, where Bordeaux played host to Toulouse in a 6 goal thriller. It was the hosts to managed to edge out the opposition this time, leaving with all the points in a 4-2 victory. Braithwaite was incredible, playing a part in 3 of the goals, with one assist and two scored himself.
Harbaoui 
Next up we have a match that provided nothing short of pure domination from start to finish. Zulte Waregem were 8-0 winners over Waasland Beveren, and with such a large scoreline, an Inform just has to follow. Harbaoui was in fine form, scoring not once, not twice, but three times, to help secure the win and of course, his hat-trick.
Augustin 
For our final selection this week we head back across to Germany, where we find Leipzig securing European football next year with a 6-2 win over Hertha Berlin. Augustin was a man on a mission, scoring twice and assisting a third to ensure they got the job done.

TOTW 36 Predictions,21-May-18 22:13,"Starting Eleven
Before we jump into this week’s predictions, it is important to mention that certain players may not feature, due to the upcoming Ligue 1 and Serie A TOTS release on Friday.
Also, bigger players may sneak in with weaker performances as we see a lot of the bigger leagues finishing this week.
Areola 
We kick start these predictions with a Ligue 1 player, a player who has an outside chance at a team of the season as well. Areola pulled of 6 incredible saves against Caen, to secure a point for the French Champions, and with a lack of competition, he has put himself in a fantastic position here.
Pereira 
Over to the Super Lig next, where Trabzonspor played host to Karabukspor. The game consisted of 3 goals, and each one of these went in favour of the hosts. Pereira was the man behind two of these, and when we consider that he is a full-back, who also managed to keep a clean sheet, the achievement becomes even more impressive.
Dubois 
Back across to France now, where a single goal separated Nantes and Strasbourg in their Ligue 1 fixture. Dubois was the man behind the goal, and was also a part of the defensive structure that provided a clean sheet. Ticking two boxes could very possibly be enough to see his name in lights this week.
Rugani 
Over to Italy next, and a game where we saw Buffon end his magical career at Juventus. The game itself was very tight, and Juventus only just edged out a 2-1 victory. Now while Rugani didn’t keep a clean sheet, he did score the winning goal, and with the Serie A TOTS dropping this week, maybe he can steal a spot amongst the others!
Vecino 
Now whether a hero card or a team of the week card is more fitting, is debatable for sure, however the importance of Vecino’s goal, simply cannot go unnoticed. Inter Milan pulled off a 3-2 win against Lazio, and with the winner securing Champions League next season, this match literally had everything to play for. Vecino scored a late winner, after a penalty brought Inter Milan back into the match, and with it, we will see Inter Milan in the CL next year!
Sanson 
Is this selection a little ambitious? Possibly. Was Sanson absolutely incredible on the weekend? Not really. However with the lack of big games, and especially big performances from midfielders, a goal during a 2-1 win for Marseille, may just about be enough to see him receive his first special card of the year.
Calhanoglu 
AC Milan have had an extremely average season, one that definitely fell short of expectations. With the final game of the season, a home match against Fiorentina, they at least managed to ends things on a high. A 5-1 win here showed what they are building, and with a goal and 3 assists, Calhanoglu comfortably makes our shortlist.
Rony Lopes
I’m starting to worry myself with some of these choices, as once again we see a player who could easily feature within the Ligue 1 TOTS. Although we run this risk, we can’t ignore top performances based on speculation and hence Lopes makes our predictions thanks to his 2 goals, during a 3-0 win for Monaco against Troyes.
David Villa
America is our next stop, where NYCFC player hosts to Colorado. The match brought us four goals, and sadly for Colorado, they all went in favour of the hosts. Villa scored twice and assisted a third, which is more than likely enough to secure him his first Inform of the campaign.
Depay
Damn! This man may not have started the season with a bang, but his performances for the second half have been nothing short of incredible. Another game, and yet another hat-trick. Lyon beat Nice 3-2 on the weekend, and while normally Depay would be a lock, the likelihood of a team of the season card this week may see him miss out.
Gomez 
Over to Spain for our next selection, where Celta Vigo and Levante faced off in the final game of their season. In a game that provided us with 6 goals, four went in favour of the home side. Now while Aspas has a chance, after scoring twice, our nomination goes with Gomez, who scored twice and also provided an assist.

REVIEW - PRIME ICON Okocha,08-Feb-18 16:23,"Jay-Jay Okocha, he was so good they named him twice. But I can only bring myself to call him Jay Okocha when I’m using him. He was the Nigerian Prince who knew how to entertain, and I’ve got to say that he’s very similar on the virtual pitch. The fancy feet and the 80’s high top fade certainly left an impression on me and made for an interesting 10 games. With that being said I’ll get onto it because I’m excited to present Jay-Jay Okocha’s Prime Icon card.
This review is based off of 10 games played at the CAM position, the majority in Division 1, using the “Basic” and “Hawk” chemistry styles.  He was supported by the following team:
 

 
PACE
Jay-Jay can certainly put one foot in front of the other very quickly. 90 acceleration and 84 sprint speed means he has fantastic bursts of energy to slingshot himself through a gap in the midfield. He does a great job going from a near standstill to accelerating off and into the sunset. Okocka’s speed is impressive and good…for his card. I’ll explain what I mean by that, he only has 84 sprint speed meaning he accelerates very quickly but hits his speed cap just as fast. So he’ll fly off but won’t incrementally get faster and faster like many players do, he simply cracks off like a bullet and maintains that speed which over time doesn’t feel as fast. This means most fullbacks will catch up to him and he can have trouble with CB’s like Bailly, Koscielny, Varane, and Azpilicueta. But here’s where it gets interesting. As a CAM Okocha plays between the midfield and the opposing defensive line, so he thrives off these quick accelerations that leave the midfield in the dust and threaten the defensive line. When he makes runs, he’s making them near the penalty box or before even reaching the defensive line. So he isn’t needing that 90 sprint speed to beat everyone, but just to get a short distance. He isn’t really designed to play as a striker, more of a CF/CAM role. I’m not saying it isn’t do-able, but his work rates don’t necessarily support it either. All-in-all his speed is great and you will love his acceleration, but he can lack that top speed of a striker.
Rating; 3.5/5
 
SHOOTING
This is where I start to have so much fun with Okocha. All I have to say is that this man is so much fun to play with. Outside the box Jay-Jay is such a threat, and I’m not talking about Hawaii’s recent nuclear bomb threat, I’m thinking more along the lines of ‘obesity in Mexico’ as a threat. He not only has a cannon instead of his right leg but it’s an incredibly accurate cannon. 87 shot power feels more like 90+, and 89 long shots means he’s no stranger to curling one into the top corner from distance. That’s what I mean by an ‘outside-the-box-threat’, you cannot leave him unmarked with any space even from 30 yards. That being said he does have a disappointing 79 finishing, but the truth is it actually impressed me quite a bit. He did not have any moments where he bottled an easy goal but rather he scored so many world class strikes and even made the smaller finishes. I think what plays into that is his positioning being 88 so he’s in the right place at the right time inside the box. 
Rating; 3.5/5
 
PASSING
Something that I genuinely loved about Okocha’s prime card is that he was pleasantly good at passing. He does have the “Playmaker Trait” paired up with 83 short passing, 86 vision, and 92 curve. His short passing is not the most impressive and I can vouch for that, but rather it gets the job done much like someone who has to clean the sewers. He’s going to do it cause he’s getting paid to, and will do a good job, but he doesn’t enjoy doing it. The same can be said for Okocha because he loves the ball on his own feet. He can get a play moving but you just know when he has possession he does not want to do anything but keep it for himself. He only provided one assist for me in the 10 games, but that doesn’t come close to showing how he started up attacks from deep in the midfield, he simply wasn’t the one providing the last crucial pass but more likely to be scoring. That being said, I have never felt someone so deadly from set pieces. I have had Prime Roberto Carlos as my free-kick taker for 350+ games and he’s scored maybe 5 free kicks. In the 10 games I used Okocha he scored two and hit the post three times, one free kick from 37 yards out and another from 32 yards, stunning shots that dropped my jaw. I religiously try the shot from 20 to 40 yards out whenever given the opportunity and will come close, and sometimes I score, but in 10 games to score twice and come so close another two times is note-worthy and not just luck.
Rating; 4/5
 
DRIBBLING
Without a doubt the most fun I’ve had this FIFA so far is using Jay-Jay Okocha’s card at CAM for this reason right here. 93 ball control, 96 dribbling, 93 agility, and 89 balance coupled with 5 star skill moves is, what Ray Hudson would call, Magisterial! This Nigerian wizard can dribble, my oh my can he dribble, I don’t even know where to begin. His first touch is so perfect that there’s no buffer time in between trapping the ball and turning/passing. He can trap the ball and make a perfect pass/shot/skill move with no half a second to wait and 100% accuracy. Jay-Jay is the Tom Brady of dribbling, his agility, balance, and ball control is sublime. I would rather dribble with Okocha than watch Zweback get one million subscribers. Unlimited XBOX controllers for when I trash mine? Nope, dribbling with Okocha. Knowing how to cook something besides hot pockets and pizza rolls? Nope, dribbling with Okocha. His foot is plastered in Gorilla glue and each and every touch of the ball is inch perfect and stuck to his feet. His skill moves come out so quickly and close to his feet, it’s obscene. I cannot find the words to describe it you simply need to get in game yourself and give it a try. 
Rating; 5/5
 
PHYSICAL
Every stat leading up to physical was a rollercoaster making the slow ascent to the apex and all of that excitement and adrenaline has built, but now the roller coaster’s jammed and you’re stuck right at the drop. His stamina is just a frowny face, but if you look close enough it says 72 stamina. Jay-Jay is struggling to not have a stroke in the 75th minute and is in full cardiac arrest past the 90th. He’s exhausted all of that Nigerian Prince money he’s been e-mailing us all about on his touch and dribbling and hasn’t bothered to run sprints with the rest of the squad. He needs a replacement if the game is tight as it closes down. Setting that aside he also has a whopping 62 strength which means a strong gust of wind will knock him over. Do not forget that he has incredible balance and agility so he’s very good at staying on his feet, but if he’s fighting shoulder to shoulder with essentially anyone aside from Insigne and Messi he’ll be eating grass very quickly. 
Rating; 2/5
 
MENTALITY
Jay-Jay Okocha is interesting because of his work rates. He’s a Medium/Low player so he’s not pressing against the defensive line at all times, more like he’s sitting in the middle of the pitch ready to get the ball and move up himself. That being said he also has that 88 positioning so he is where he needs to be. Okocha knows where he needs to be and he’s the one starting the attack not just finishing it. He will always play in between your defensive midfielder and your striker(s) ready to move the ball from back to front. I think as a Medium/Low he is the most effective his card could be because it’s how he’s built to be played. You want to get the ball with him to move past everyone, then feed it to your striker to finish it. If not that, then to make it to the edge of the box and curl it in. He also has traits to help his free-kicks which were amazing, and of course his 5 star skill moves and 4 star weak foot. The weak foot I rarely noticed and found to be quite alright so I wouldn’t worry about it. I would steer clear of taking long shots with his weak foot though as they need to be both powerful and very accurate and that should be reserved for his strong foot. 
Rating; 4/5
 
CONSENSUS
Rating; 3.66/5
 
Non-Competitive 
Rating; 5/5
Jay-Jay Okocha, in my opinion, is everything that makes this game fun. He’s the showman, the guy to pull of an elastico followed by a Berba spin before trying the outside the foot 30 yard shot that ends up top corner. He will consistently make you audibly say “wow…” and there’s not a single moment you won’t enjoy using him. Yes he’s weak, yes he has low stamina, yes he isn’t spectacular at many different things aside from his dribbling, but everything he does is so much fun. He’s not meant to be used in some top-tier team ready to battle in the weekend league, but to be put in your fitness team to make you realize why you love FIFA again. Now I’m not saying he’s not first team quality, he definitely is. But for his price you can also get Prime Pires who’s a better CAM, or De Bruyne, Eriksen, etc. You could invest the coins smarter in many other places but I’m so ridiculously tempted to complete his SBC because of how amazing it is to just toy around the field and enjoy myself. 

My consensus is that everyone should use his loan card. But if you have extra coins or do not only play weekend league, get him. He won’t be as fun if you use him competitively and isn’t very cheap. So if you are starting to get tired of FIFA or just want something new he’s the guy for you. I honestly cannot say when the last time I had this much fun with a card was, maybe SBC Quaresma in the first two weeks of this FIFA. Jay-Jay Okocha is an absolute gem for different reasons, so thank you EA for making a card that seriously gave me a different view of this game.
 
Game Stats:

 

Game Highlights:"
TOTW21 Predictions,05-Feb-18 14:50,"Starting Eleven
Leno 
Freiburg 0-0 Leverkusen 5 Saves
Telles 
Porto played hosts to Braga for their weekend clash and in a game of 4 goals, they left as comfortable 3-1 winners. Telles at the back was the star of the show, putting in a solid defensive performance as well as assisting each and every goal for Porto. Surely this is enough for a second Inform.
Jardel 
Benfica played hosts to Rio Ave for their weekend fixture and after a dominating display, they left as 5-1 victors. Jardel is our selection from the match, solid defensively, an assist and even a goal to his name, is surely enough for an Inform this week.
Ake 
In the first round of Premier League fixtures this week Bournemouth were way to Chelsea in a game most expected them to lose. Thanks to some fantastic tactics, attacking plays and solid defensive showings, Bournemouth left as 3-0 winners. Ake not only ensured a clean sheet, but also scored one of the goals against his former club!
Sandro 
Juventus were at home to Sassuolo on the weekend and their 7-0 thrashing is worthy of not just one, but two possible informs. First up we have Sandro, solid at the back as always alongside an assist and a goal to his name this week.
KDB 
What more can be said about this man, recently voted into the FUT TOTY and without question one of the best players in the world. When Manchester City beat West Brom 3-0, once again this man was not only assisting but getting his name on the scoresheet. Hopefully this is enough for another Inform.
Illarramendi 
Real Sociedad were hosts to Deportivo for their La Liga clash and in a dominating display they wrapped up all 3 points in a 5-0 win. Illarramendi was the man of the match, scoring twice and putting in a near perfect performance to secure his spot in these predictions.
Ramsey 
Arsenal have really been struggling as of late and with the recent departure of Alexis, people were starting to question their abilities. In a 5-1 thrashing at home to Everton, they silenced all doubters, which is why we are not one but two Arsenal players in these predictions as well. First up is Ramsey, with a hat-trick there is simply no chance he is left out!
Thauvin 
From one hat-trick to another, but this time we are in Ligue 1 for a match between Marseille and Metz. In a game of 9 goals, it was the hosts to took the points in a 6-3 showing. Thauvin not only assisted one but went on to score three. Outstanding.
Salah 
One of the most successful signings of the year finds his name on our predictions once more. Liverpool drew 2-2 with Tottenham on the weekend in a game full of controversy and surprises. Two incredible goals, including a fantastic solo effort by this man almost won the points, only to be denied by a penalty in the final seconds. The only question is, will 2 goals in a draw be enough?
Higuain 
After last year, we came to expect this man to be Inform almost every week however a tougher season has left him with just the one special card to date. This however is about to change! As mentioned before, Juventus won 7-0 on the weekend and while everyone was fantastic, Higuain bagged himself a hat-trick.
 
Substitutes
Hennessey 
Over to the Premier League again here where Crystal Palace were hosts to Newcastle. In an incredibly tight game neither team could edge ahead and with 7 saves Hennessy played a huge part in ensuring a 1-1 draw was maintained.
R.Silva 
Braga were hosts to Aves for their fixture on the weekend and in a comfortable 2-0 victory they left with all the points. Silva at the back was the man who stood out, incredible at the back while also scoring one of the goals. A dream performance for a CB!
Silva 
From one solid CB performance onto another now. Caen were 3-2 victors over the travelling Nantes during their Ligue 1 clash. Now while Silva may not have kept a clean sheet, his two goals going forward were critical in the victory and hence this CB makes the cut for his attacking display opposed to his defensive one!
Debuchy 
Finally Debuchy managed to get away from Arsenal and get himself some minutes on the pitch. Saint-Etienne were away to Amiens for their weekend fixture and in a 2-0 victory, Debuchy not only helped maintain a clean sheet but also scored one of the goals too!
Yuri 
Our final defensive selection this week sees us head across to a side known commonly for their attacking success this year. PSG beat Lille 3-0 on the weekend and with a clean sheet and a goal to his name, Yuri is the man who makes the predictions.
Clucas 
Heading back to a couple of the earlier Premier League games now and first up we have Swansea’s 3-1 victory over Arsenal to talk about. In this incredible performance, Clucas was the man who stole the show. Scoring twice he secured the much needed points and hopefully a spot in this TOTW.
Walcott 
Everton were hosts to Leicester earlier in the week and thanks to one man, they managed to steal the points in a 2-1 victory. New summer signing Walcott was the man of the hour, scoring both goals in a near flawless performance.
Mkhitaryan 
Now we have already seen Ramsey feature in these predictions and with a hat-trick he is all but nailed on. During that same game however Mkhitaryan bagged himself a hat-trick of assists in an incredible performance. The question is, are EA generous enough to give us two players here?
Batshuayi 
It’s OTW players galore in these predictions, and to find the next one we head over to Germany. Dortmund we’re away to FC Cologne for their Bundesliga clash and in a 3-2 victory their new winter signing, on his debut, was the hero. With 2 goals and an assist for the third, surely Batshuayi has done enough already!
Caputo 
We have three players left in these predictions, and 3 fantastic hat-tricks to talk about. First up Empoli were hosts to Palermo on the weekend and with an extremely comfortable 4-0 win, they took all the points. Caputo as mentioned before was the man of the hour, bagging himself a hat-trick, the match ball and hopefully an Inform too!
Jong 
PSV were hosts to PEC Zwolle and in a dominating performance they wrapped up the points in a 4-0 win. Jong was the player who stood out, scoring himself a hat-trick and helping wrap up the points for his side.
Martinez 
Our final selection this week sees us head over to Argentina, where Racing Club were hosts to Huracan. Just like the previous two games, it was another 4-0 win for the home side and another hat-trick for a superstar! Martinez was the man this time and hopefully he gets his reward."

POTM September - Week 4,30-Sep-17 10:30,"Yesterday saw the August POTM SBC finally hit the game, and with it a brand new shiny Sadio Mane card became available. Now of course the natural reaction is to relish this moment, jump into some investments around him or even simply play some games with the new superstar, however we have no time, as the September POTM is just around the corner.
Although the month of September isn’t quite finished, the end is near and hence a shortlist of the most likely candidates provides a realistic insight as to who could win this award. Here we will consider who’s had a standout month, who could be the front runner as it stands and ultimately who you believe deserves your investments.
All ratings within the guide are taken from whoscored.
 
Arsenal
Arsenal 3 – 0 Bournemouth
Chelsea 0 – 0 Arsenal
Arsenal 2 – 0 West Brom
Arsenal ? - ? Brighton
Koscielny
With ratings of 7.7, 7.7, 7.3 and clean sheets throughout the month Koscielny has been extremely solid at the back for Arsenal. While consistent across all games, the lack of goals, assists and man of the match performances however means he has everything to do going into the final game.
Mustafi
With ratings of 7.9, 7.3, 7.2 and clean sheets throughout the month Mustafi has been extremely solid at the back for Arsenal. While consistent across all games, the lack of goals, assists and man of the match performances however means he has everything to do going into the final game.
Monreal
With ratings of 7.8, 7.6, 9.1, clean sheets throughout the month and a man of the match performance, Monreal seems to have placed himself slightly ahead of his teammates so far. With just Brighton left to play on the weekend, a big performance coupled with a goal could give him a serious shout for contention.

Tottenham
Everton 0 – 3 Tottenham
Tottenham 0 – 0 Swansea
West Ham 2 – 3 Tottenham
Huddersfield ? - ? Tottenham

Kane
With ratings of 9.2, 6.8, 9.0, four goals and two man of the match performances, Kane has had a fantastic month so far. Drawing a blank against Swansea and not securing the three points, looks like being the only downfall here as competition across the board is extremely high. A big performance in the final game against Huddersfield however could change everything.
 
Chelsea
Leicester 1 – 2 Chelsea
Chelsea 0 – 0 Arsenal
Stoke 0 – 4 Chelsea
Chelsea ? - ? Manchester City
Morata
With ratings of 7.3, 6.3, 9.5, four goals and a man of the match performance, it seems safe to say that Morata has hit the ground running at Chelsea. While impressive, the draw against Arsenal really sticks out, but with Manchester City as the last game of the month, a huge performance here could easily tip the scales in his favour.
Kante
With ratings of 8.4, 7.3, 7.8, one goal and a man of the match performance, Kante has once again found his form and seems to be controlling the midfield without even breaking a sweat. Sadly though, the same problem pops up again here, it’s just not enough to compete for the top spot as it stands. In order to win he will need to create something extra special in the final game.
 
Manchester United
Stoke 2 -2 Manchester United
Manchester United 4 – 0 Everton
Southampton 0 – 1 Manchester United
Manchester United ? - ? Crystal Palace
Lukaku
With ratings of 7.1, 8.3, 7.8, three goals, one assist and a man of the match performance the sensational summer purchase shows no signs of slowing down! With a goal per game and strong ratings throughout, Lukaku shows consistency but the lost points against Stoke will definitely go against him. As it stands he is playing catch up in regards to his goals scored tally, but he strives under pressure and going up against bottom of the table Crystal Palace, I wouldn’t rule him out just yet.
 
Manchester City
Manchester City 5 – 0 Liverpool
Watford 0 – 6 Manchester City
Manchester City 5 – 0 Crystal Palce
Chelsea ? - ? Manchester City
The Entire Defence
While they receive a mention here for clean sheets across the month, when your team is firing like these guys, it becomes almost impossible to get a look in for this month’s award! Keep in mind though, if John Stones manages to bag a hattrick that includes a 87 yard scorpion kick, we may suddenly find ourselves with a new leading man!
Sterling
With ratings of 9.5, 8.4 and three goals Sterling seems to be striving under the new manager. While his performances have been solid, the fact he was left out of the first game against Liverpool and that almost his entire team have been unstoppable, leaves him with a small mountain to climb if he wants this award again.
Sane
With ratings of 8.2, 6.3, 10.0, three goals, 2 assists and a man of the match Sane is another youngster who seems to have found his place this season. While the stats suggest he is a front runner, the fact that he was a late substitution in two of the games puts him at a disadvantage. Once again, he needs to put in the performance of a lifetime against Chelsea, but most importantly he needs to start.
Silva
With ratings of 7.1, 8.7, 8.8 and 4 assists, Silva is simply doing what Silva does every season. While a fundamental part of the team and a huge factor for the dominance and results, the lack of goals for an attacking midfielder places him a little behind the pace, leaving him with a lot to do in the final game of the month.
De Bruyne
With ratings of 8.9, 8.4, 7.6, three assists and a man of the match performance, De Bruyne is once again showing why he is one of the greatest attacking midfielders in the world. We face the same concerns here that we have with Silva though, the lack of goals stands out, leaving him with a lot to do against Chelsea.
Jesus
With ratings of 8.4, 8.1 and three goals from two games, it looks like Jesus has fully recovered from last season’s injury. The key concern here is game time, he has featured in only two of the three games so far, but with Aguero likely out for the Chelsea game, it’s never too late to steal the crown.
Aguero
With ratings of 8.9, 10.0, 8.9, 5 goals, 3 assists and a man of the match performance, we have an extremely clear front runner going into the final weekend. With the horrific news that he was recently in a car crash, he currently looks unlikely to feature for Manchester City anytime soon. There is a good chance what he has achieved already will be enough, but with one game left anything can happen.
 
Conclusion
As you can see, we have one hell of a list of possible winners, but when we take a closer look you can quickly place a small handful well above the rest. While Aguero seems to be a long way ahead, the fact that he is probably missing the last game does give a few others a chance to take the lead. Lukaku and Kane both have a shot if they can bag themselves a few goals, while almost the whole of the Manchester City squad is within touching distance. It’s important we are following this weekend’s matches closely and are ready to pounce on our investments when the time is right."
FUT FM EPISODE 52,28-May-18 05:00,"Hey comrades, the FIFA 18 World Cup update is just around the corner, so let’s take a look at some interesting ratings and how they may affect your squads!
 

 
 
A Major Downgrade To A Major Player… Or Is It?!
 


One of the best FIFA 18 all around central midfielders has gone from 86 to 81.
That’s right, Radja Nainggolan has been super nerfed. To be fair, he’s had a poor season and even our resident Roma fan (Valerio) will admit that fact any day of the week.
However, Nainggolan’s face attributes have only been reduced by a couple of points each, so the downgrade is not as bad as it first seems. He will likely still be a very solid CM option, and with the lower rating, you can expect to see him packed more often.
We recommend pairing him with a pacey midfielder though, since a lot of early teams will tend to focus on pace. Pace has traditionally been the lynchpin of the FIFA meta, and it’s even more popular in the early days of squad building.
With such a big pace focus, strength often gets overlooked. Buffing Nainggolan defensively will help turn him into an excellent box to box midfielder early on in the game.
 
The Samba Sweat Is Real

Ok, so every FIFA has some pacey Brazilian players, but get ready for a whole new level of sweat!
Fagner (77 RB) will have 84 pace, making him an easy early game pick for many squads.
Fred (81 CM) will have 81 pace, along with decent attributes in all other categories.
Taison (82 LW) will have 92 pace. Enough said.
Douglas Costa (83 LW) will have 93 pace.
Aaaaaand Giuliano (83 CAM) will have 82 pace.
If you pack any of these Brazilians -and the chances will be very decent- you’re looking at a huge advantage early on in the World Cup.
Whether you prefer to play centrally or on the wings, you’ll be able to string together explosive attacks and quick counter attacks with “average” players.
 
The Chemistry System Gives You More Options

In the FIFA 18 World Cup update, chemistry will be based on nationality and international federations.
This means that you can easily make multi nation hybrids using the 433 formation (which you can change in game if desired).
So if we think back to what the meta was at the start of FIFA 18 (hint: Bakayoko), we can already get a sense of what kind of squads will be effective early on.
Imagine a Brazil + France hybrid ;)
That’s it for this week comrades, thanks for checking out FUT FM 52. We’ll be back next week with much more on the World Cup, including the new icons!

Trading Before Release (Short Term),21-Sep-17 19:19,"Trading before and during the release of a new game can always be a difficult hurdle to overcome.  With new additions added each year, the market instantly becomes that little bit more unpredictable as the general player has their attention directed to these new exciting features. This being said, there will always be tried and tested trading methods that remain effective, alongside riskier investments with a much larger potential return. In this guide we will be looking at the different approaches we could make to maximize efficiency in the initial week or two.
 
Considering The Player-Base
Starting off with the facts, during early access the average FUT player will be extremely limited as to how many coins they have available. Yes, we will see superstar stacked teams within the first day, but this will be due to either incredible pack luck or simply spending a small fortune on FIFA points. This leads us to the situation we are all currently in, the reason you are probably reading this post, everybody will be looking to ""trade"". Now the reason I say ""trade"" is because the majority of people will be limited to tools and techniques that they have used before or seen influential figures use time after time. BPM (Bronze Pack Method) and sniping are the two that come to mind, and while effective they can initially drop in value to so many players attempting them.
Another fact we need to keep in mind is that the caliber of player in demand will be significantly lower than we are use to. Players simply will not have the coins to afford top names and if we couple this with the limited supply available, it is unlikely that this is ever where we direct our attention when it comes to starting off with trading.
 
Considering What Sells
Just like the above, this is all based of previous years and is simply how a market works. If players cannot afford their first choice, they simply move down the list until players within their budget become available. Imagine we start off, grind through a bunch of games and generate 30,000 coins. Depending on prices, we could hypothetically jump onto the market and buy a great tier 2 player such as Martial, sinking every last coin we have into them. Great, we finally made a huge upgrade to our team, the only issue is we now have no coins left for position modifiers, chemistry styles, contracts or even fitness for this new player, we are now forced to repeat this process from before until we can pick up our second, third or fourth player etc.
Now I am not suggesting that players such as Martial will not sell, I am simply suggesting that the majority of people won't be aiming quite so high and hence the market is a lot thinner than that of tier 3/4 players. Picking up Martial for 30,000 coins and instantly selling on for 31,000 may seem like a win, but after tax you are left with 29,450 coins, you actually made a loss. Even if you are able to sell him for 32,000 coins you will only make a 400 coin profit. People are very careful with listing players at the start of a cycle, and even when such a card is listed for 20,000 coins just imagine how many others will be attempting to snipe it?
Now if we repeated this process, but turned our attention to a tier 4 player such as Robertson (the new Liverpool LB), how would the possible results look? Well to start with he would be packed a lot more and hence availability on the market would be much greater. Due to this we would be dealing with a player with a much larger demand as more people would instantly be able to afford him. Then the final fact is that he is still a strong player within his position, we aren't just picking a player who is trash, he has well rounded stats and will likely hold his spot down until that premium upgrade is available.
With the hypothetical pricing again, let's say he goes for 3,000 coins initially. We have a lot more of him being packed, hence a lot more entering the market, and therefore a load more sniping or biding opportunities to win him, this is our first plus. As the card is only 3,000 coins, people will happily undercut the market selling for say 2,800 coins as it is ""only"" a 200 coin loss. If we are sniping Robertson and winning them at 2,800 coins, we are making 50 coins per card, nothing fantastic but its profit. In reality, the volume of cards you are able to win bids on or snipe for say 2,500 coins will be more than sufficient, now these wins will pay 350 coins per card. Then you have those huge wins where somebody will list or you will win a bid for say 1,000 coins (it happens more than you may think with the lower tier players), this win pays out a massive 1,850 coins! If you are consistent, and pick up any card with profit available, these 3 scenarios together very quickly add up.
Think about how often these players are packed, how many others will be wanting to trade with them and hence what the likelihood of success is from trading with them.
 
BPM
Bronze pack method, possibly my favorite trading tool simply because of how easy yet effective it is. The single largest benefit to this method is how there is never a correct or incorrect time to use it, you are simply opening bronze packs and then selling the contents. Sadly, like with any method is still has its downsides and they are what we will be looking at here.
BPM is the most common trading method, is promoted by almost every influential figure who streams or makes videos and will therefore likely be where most people start attempting to generate coins. Now usually this isn't an issue as with the inclusion of SBC's demand for the contents of these packs has never been higher, however during the start of a new cycle, which cards really carry an above average level of demand? Unlike most trading methods the prices here never fluctuate, the cost is always 400 coins to open the pack and hence the market needs to be able to replenish what you spend. With the extremely large quantities of FIFA points being spent on gold packs, your premium items such as squad fitness cards or healing cards are unlikely to hold such a premium price-tag, especially with the initial lack of game time available on early access and the exclusion of weekend league during the first few weeks.
On release, the quantity of SBC's available will also be extremely limited, with potentially just two league ones coming into play. Again, these players we pack will hold value for the future, other leagues being released, marquee match-ups and a whole heap of other challenges, but we can fill our club up with this method whenever we see fit, during release we are looking to obtain cards and then offload them just as quickly, something BPM is unlikely to provide.
Now in no way am I saying that BPM will not be effective, the cards that you pack hold both initial and future value. I am simply suggesting that while coin totals are lower and the market attempting to settle, there will almost always be a more efficient, more profitable way of investing your coins during this period.
 
Sniping & Mass Bidding
Another two well known methods, both of which we spoke about above, but how can we maximize the efficiency when using them? There a couple of simple methods here that can help you judge just how successful your targets are and how to determine when you should change things up.
The frequency they appear. How often is this player being listed? Are you able to place 20 bids on this player before you reach a time remaining you would like to avoid? Are you finding one pop up while sniping ever 30 seconds or every 5 minutes? These are clear indications as to just how viable trading with this player is at any given time.
The quantity you win. While it is fantastic if the frequency is high, if you are winning hardly any your targets it quickly becomes irrelevant. If you are constantly being outbid, or are too slow with the sniping, it suggests that there is a lot of others attempting to trade with the same player. Don't start worrying about your prices, or your lack of speed, simply accept that there will be better targets out there and head out to find them.
The profit you expect. How much are you expecting to make, on average, with each successful bid/snipe? Are you aiming to high that you are simply never winning anything? Are you aiming so low that your hourly profit is laughable? It is a fine balancing act and one that takes time to perfect, but as long as you remain realistic your targets should remain achievable.
Having a rotation. This is probably the most important factor when attempting these methods. Just because you had great success with a player in the morning, doesn't mean that it will work in the afternoon. Creating yourself a shortlist of between 10 and 20 players allows you to simply cycle through them, avoiding any that appear to be heavily in contention at any given time.
Selling. With these types of investment, we are typical looking for a quick win. Picking the player up for X, we are instantly looking to relist for Y and take our profit. These type of methods should be providing instant financial gain and should never effect our longer term investments.
 
Price Fluctuations During The Day
The afternoon in England, is the middle of the night in Australia and the morning in the USA, this alone dictates the amount of players active at any given time. During periods where a large number of people are playing, demand will immediately increase simply because more people are attempting to obtain a card at the same time. The reverse works exactly the same, when the servers are quieter the demand is significantly less and hence in theory you have a better chance of securing a bargain on a bid.
We need to keep this in mind when it comes to buying and selling players. Are we buying at a time when supply is limited? Are we buying at a time when demand is higher than normal? If the answer is yes, we are currently in a sellers market and prices may be sitting at their peak, obviously this makes for a fairly poor investment. Are we buying at a time when supply is flooding the market? Are we buying at a time when demand is lower than normal? This time, if the answer is yes we are buying within a buyers market, this is the absolute ideal time to pick up players.
Provided we have done our research and we know our price brackets (what a player should sell for and hence the expected profit), then this isn't as big a concern, it will likely mean that you simply win more/less of the given player. The real importance here is to study the market, use FUTBIN to track hourly, daily or weekly price swings, and then use this information to your advantage. The market is the same for everybody, the only variable is the user who is navigating it. If you are more prepared, better equipped and have completed adequate research, this is where you will gain the advantage."
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,01-Feb-18 07:44,"Tottenham vs Arsenal
First up this week we head over to England for a couple of selections, the first of which within the Premier League. Now Tottenham featured in our predictions last week as they had a big match against Liverpool, however after seeing no Premier League games selected once again, I instantly become a lot more optimistic about this match! Tottenham play hosts to Arsenal in the North London Derby, a widely know footballing rivalry that dates back roughly 100 years. Investments are nice and simple here, just aim for decent ratings at discard prices.

Aston Villa vs Birmingham
Staying in England for our second selection and we simply drop down a division, where we find the Championship. Aston Villa play hosts to Birmingham in a rivalry known as the “Second City Derby”. The match gets its name due to Birmingham apparently being the “second city of the UK”, but the name here is irrelevant, as the heat and hatred between the two clubs is what really grabs people’s attention. While gold players are available, they are in limited supply leaving silver players at discard as our ideal investment. A possible rating requirement here does worry me, so if silver are too expensive, aim for gold at discard and if not bronze as our final choice. 

Valencia CF vs Levante UD
Next up we head over to La Liga, where València play hosts to Levante, in a match known only as the “Valencian Derby” (Derbi Valenciano). These clubs are the largest within the city of Valencia, and is therefore how the name came about. Luckily both teams have more than enough gold cards to choose from and if we decide to invest here, we just want to ensure we are paying discard prices once again.

Gimnasia vs Estudiantes
Over to Argentina next where we find Gimnasia play hosts to Estudiantes in the “La Plata Derby” (Clasico Platenese or Clasico De La Plata). As one of the fiercest matches in Argentinian football, the derby itself dates back over 100 years and has an absolutely incredible fan base behind the fixture itself. Once again, if we choose to invest here, discard, discard, discard! Make sure you are bidding or sniping if prices begin to rise! Reduce risk and increase potential profits whenever possible!

Kawasaki vs Cerezo Osaka
Usually within Marquee Matchups, EA stays clear of Cup games until there is no other option, or the Champions League begins to get serious. Sometimes however, a cup final can grab their attention and as we have seen several times already this year, it stands a great chance of making the cut. The Japanese Super Cup final takes place next week and features both Kawasaki and Cerezo Osaka. Both sides lack gold players, so investments elsewhere become ideal. Aim to pay around discard and for safety, sell into any hype.

 
Based on previous data and selections, if we see a League feature within Marquee Matchups one week, it becomes a lot less likely to feature the week after. Now I’m not saying it doesn’t happen, it’s just less common. Both of our final picks would follow this logic, however both games are huge and hence deserve our attention either way.

Bayern Munich vs Schalke
Over to the Bundesliga for this selection where top of the table Bayern play hosts to third place Schalke. With Bayern already 16 points clear, it seems very unlikely they are getting caught, however Champions League spots below them are in tight contention and hence Schalke could really use a win here. Like most of the big clubs in most of the big leagues, we have plenty of gold cards available and are spoilt for choice when it comes to investing.

Napoli vs Lazio
For our final selection we head over to Italy, where we find Napoli and Lazio go head to head in the Serie A. After an incredible first half of the season, Napoli sit atop the table, a point clear of Juventus and 11 points clear of third placed Lazio. A win here for Napoli would see them hold onto that top spot for another week, while a win for Lazio would see them start to close the gap. Again, hold cards, easy, discard, you know what to do!"
Review - IF 89 Mertens,01-Feb-18 16:01,"Dries Mertens, enough said. If you haven’t used his card before then you’re severely missing out on your FIFA experience. He’s almost legally considered a dwarf, his dribbling feels like EA accidentally turned up the sliders too far, and I cannot stress how lethal his right foot is, like Texas capital punishment type of deadly. Mertens earned his third inform of this FIFA after he scored two goals against Bologna this past Sunday. Setting aside the fact that Napoli played against a deli meat and conceded, since his position change playing for Napoli he’s been absolutely on fire and spawning informs for the past couple FIFA’s and thus breaking many controllers. Let’s see just how he actually feels in game and whether he’s worth the arm and leg that he costs as of today.
This review is based off of 10/12 games using the “Basic” chemistry style, and the following team supported him;

PACE
Mertens stands tall at 5’7” (169cm), and if I know anything about short players it’s that they usually make up for their genetic inferiority by being lightning fast. He’s no exception. Dries Mertens has a ridiculous 96 acceleration paired up with 89 sprint speed. For a 30 year old striker I’m rather impressed. In-game he shoots off from a standstill like a bullet from a gun, tearing through defenses in a deadly fashion. His pace is absolutely top-notch and feels like EA turned up the sliders too far. He goes from 0 to 100 much like a Bugatti Veyron, I mean the guy gives Bellerin a run for his money. If you’re looking for that explosively quick and agile striker, look no further than this beautiful Belgian as he’s your man.
Rating; 4.5/5
SHOOTING
The further I go down his stats the more impressed I become. He has 92 finishing, 86 shot power, 92 positioning, and 87 long shots. Out of these 4 numbers the 2 that stand out the most are his 92 finishing and 92 positioning. Dries Mertens is making some fantastic runs through the defensive line, giving him all the space in the world to make use of his 92 finishing. It seems like a match made in heaven, a small and incredibly rapid striker who positions himself well and has very reliable finishing. I’ll take two and one Alex Hunter Coke please. In all honesty he puts away every opportunity that you give him, he doesn’t have those off moments where he narrowly misses the net one-on-one or blasts a low driven wide, it’s always in the back of the net. His shot isn’t the most powerful, but if you find it necessary then boosting his shooting with a chemistry style could impress you even more. Reliability is one of his strong points, if I had to choose someone to take the shot it’s always going to be him.
Rating; 4.5/5
PASSING
If I was to make a generalization this year, it’s that passing is a grossly overlooked statistic. What I mean is that a player with good passing doesn’t get enough credit (especially if they’re a central striker) and it can add another thorn in the side of your opponent’s defensive line. A card like Hernan Crespo will slot away goal after goal much like an elderly lady depositing her government benefits at the Casino, you can always bet on it happening. But when he’s tasked with sending a player through on goal he’ll likely fluff it all up. Dries Mertens on the other hand has 87 short passing, 88 vision, and 87 curve. So not only can he score a hat-trick, he’ll set up SIF Icardi for one too. At the end of the 12 games Mertens had set up 10 different goals for me, assisting as easily as he was scoring. While having Hernan Crespo is incredible, having someone who can do everything in the striker handbook from A to Z leaves you satisfied and confident in your player. This also means Mertens can not only play as a striker, but would be just as effective as a CAM since he’s able to string together passes so nicely.
Rating; 4/5
DRIBBLING
I’ve used NIF Messi for well over 400 games and can say hands down that he’s the most incredible player to dribble with. This third inform Mertens makes me stutter before answering that question. The 97 agility and 95 balance make for an incredibly centered player pushing down the pitch. His 90 ball control and 92 dribbling leave little to be desired. Now while my answer to the previous question is still Messi, this not-so-young Belgian is an absolute joy to use in this regard. If you can think back a few years to when FIFA instantly responded to your inputs, then that’s how Mertens feels. It’s like he’s a puppet and the strings are your controller making instant changes and turning on a dime. Holding down the LT/L2 for close control and cutting in between Boateng’s and Bailly’s is nearly as amazing as listening to Gordon Ramsey yell at sweaty and miserable chefs. If I had to choose my favorite category on his card between pace, dribbling, and shooting, I simply could not choose because they’re all so equally impressive. Each and everyone plays a vital role in making this card what it is.
Rating; 4.5/5
DEFENDING
He’s just as good of a defender as he is a keeper!
Rating; -4/5
PHYSICAL
Dries Mertens is a very small player, so you don’t expect much. He does have 84 stamina, which is really neither good nor bad, enough for about 90 minutes but no more. But the number you don’t want to look at is his 47 strength. If I had gotten a 47/100 my mother would’ve slapped me, and Dries Mertens is definitely getting slapped around. When he’s on the attack Mertens is much like the small child on the playground who cannot escape the looming bullies, Boateng and Bailly. If they get close enough to him he’s shoved off the ball with one finger and left to pick himself up. Use and abuse his pace and dribbling, avoiding situations where he has to hold off a player. Find the open pockets and do not try to push your way through anything that isn’t Insigne.
Rating; 1.5/5
MENTALITY
Much like his other stats, Mertens does not disappoint. He has both a four star weak foot and four star skill moves to make him even more impossible to contain. Both his right and left feet are nearly equal (I personally did not see much of a difference aside from slightly less shot power), and he can spin and twirl like an Olympic figure skater. He has the perfect High/Low work rates to keep him pushed up at all times and ready to fly through on goal, not to mention his finesse shot, long shot, and flair traits to give him even more of an edge.
Rating; 4/5
CONSENSUS
Rating; 3.83/5
As the curtains close and the lights fade, Dries Mertens can only be described as your ideal striker. He checks off all the necessary boxes.
- Incredibly fast
- Reliable shooting
- Impressive passing
- Extraterrestrial dribbling
His runs rival mine when I have food poisoning; his shots curve even more extreme than a Game of Thrones plot line; and has a firmer grasp on balls than Kevin Spacey does.
I can go all day long about how I love this card, but it wouldn’t be a proper review without mentioning the things I don’t actually enjoy. Strength is one thing, but it has to be repeated considering how awful it really is, but also he’s very short. This means he’s useless on corners, goal kicks, and anytime the ball isn’t touching the digital grass, which can be quite irritating especially if your play-style caters to tall players. Another con would be the fact that he can’t play past your typical 90 minute game. Once the game begins to come to a close Dries Mertens is dragging his feet and doesn’t seem to want the ball anymore, basically asking to be subbed off for Alessandrini. And the last con here is his price, currently at just about 1,000,000 coins. A steep number. Here’s my opinion, if you already have a nice team built and can afford him then I highly recommend it. If you do not, I’d save nearly half a million coins and get his second inform. But do not build your team around this man because the way to get the best out of him is to surround him with players able to set him up that are on his level. That means that you shouldn’t cash out to afford his card and be left with a mediocre defense and midfield with an incredible attack. If you do by chance get to use him then I’d recommend playing a 4-3-1-2 or a 4-1-2-1-2 (2) as he seems to excel paired up with a partner at striker. This Mertens card is not only very fun to use in game but very, very good and most definitely ready to go toe-to-toe with Weekend League opponents. So best of luck to all because I’m not sure how we’ll be able to hold back this late blooming Belgian beauty. And lastly, thank you for reading if you’ve managed to make it this far!
 
Game Stats:"
TOTW13 PREDICTIONS,11-Dec-17 16:32,"Starting Eleven
 
Handanovic - GK 
Juventus were hosts to the travelling Inter Milan for this Serie A fixture, and despite the home team turning the pressure up to eleven, the guests were just as prepared at the back. Between fantastic defensive performances and yet another incredible game from Handanovic, Inter Milan managed to secure a clean sheet and with it a point. Pulling off 8 saves in a match of this magnitude could very well be enough for a second inform too. 
  
Masuaku - LB 
Relegation battling West Ham were hosts to Chelsea in this London derby, and as the guests arrived, everybody was expecting one outcome. After an early goal for the hosts, 85 minutes of non-stop bombardment took place with only the backline and keeper standing in Chelsea's way. Somehow, they held on, and while most names are worth a mention, Masuaku really stands out. 
  
Nacho - CB 
Over to La Liga now where Real Madrid have had a less than impressive start to the season. With Sevilla only 3 points behind them, everybody was expecting a tight match with end to end action, however it wasn't meant to be. In a 5-0 thrashing it was Real Madrid who stole the show, and Nacho with both a goal and a clean sheet, is the player who makes these predictions. 
  
Otamendi - CB 
Another week and another inform possibility for Manchester City. We aren't even at Christmas yet, but it looks like the league is already wrapped up. United were hosts for this Manchester derby, and despite their best efforts City simply proved to be too much. With a fantastic defensive showing and the winning goal, its Otamendi who gets the nod for a second inform here. If Otamendi was too miss out though, I would expect to see Ederson take the spot, simply due to an incredible double save and fairly solid performance. 
 
Bonaventura - CM 
After their spending spree in the summer, anyone not questioning Milan's form would come as a surprise. Currently in 7th, a whole 16 points behind the leaders, if they were going to save their season it had to start soon. At home to Bologna on the weekend, once again people were likely expecting a comfortable win, however it took two fantastic goals from their CM, Bonaventura, to close out the game. 
 
Bender - CDM 
Leverkusen were the travelling side for their Bundesliga fixture on Friday, and luckily for them, the trip was completely worthwhile. In a deserved 2-0 victory, it was Bender from the CDM spot who really stood out. Contributing to both the attack and defensive duties, Bender was all over the pitch and even scored one of the two goals.

Di Maria - LW 
Top of the table and in fantastic form PSG were hosts to Lille for their Ligue 1 fixture where once again the hosts took all the points in a 3-1 victory. Now the standout performance in the match was once again Mbappe, with a goal, an assist and even the man of the match award, however he sits comfortably in the TOTGS and is hence unlikely to make the cut. With these predictions lacking bigger names, Di Maria who also scored and assisted creeps into the lineup. 
 
Son - LW 
Tottenham have been struggling recently, rapidly dropping away from any sort of title contention and slowly losing their grip on Champions League spots too. Stoke were the travelling side this week, and unluckily for them, this was the game where Tottenham decided to turn their League form around. In a 5-1 thrashing there were several fantastic performances, but Son on the left, was mesmerizing. Scoring once and assisting another, could we be seeing a second inform Son already? 
 
Promes -LW 
Moving over to Russia now with one of their largest derbies around, the Moscow Derby. Spartak were at home to CSKA and with CSKA ahead by a point, the hosts needed to make this game count. During a fantastic performance from the home team, Spartak pulled off a 3-0 victory and with 2 goals from the left, Promes could be on track for his first inform this year. 
  
Dost - ST 
Sporting were away to Boavista for their weekend clash and with Porto currently even on points and ahead on goal difference, a win was absolutely critical here. Thanks to another sensational performance from their striker, Dost, Sporting managed to wrap up a comfortable 3-1 victory, Dost scoring two of them. The only question is, will this be enough for a second inform? 
 
Germain - ST 
Marseille were hosts to Saint-Etienne for this Ligue 1 fixture and with 70% of the possession, the match was anything but even. During a comfortable 3-0 victory, two players really stood out. Thauvin from the wing had a flawless performance, assisting twice and hitting the woodwork, but it's their striker Germain who gets the nod this time. Converting twice and only being denied his hat-trick by the post, hopefully he has done enough to squeeze in.

Substitutes/Reserves
 
Sorrentino - GK 
Chievo were hosts to Roma in this Serie A clash and while we already have one big goalkeeper in this TOTW, a second here feels truly deserving. Despite Roma absolutely battering the home sides goal, both a solid defensive showing and some fantastic goalkeeping ensured that the game remained 0-0. Pulling off a total of 8 saves, Sorrentino also secures his spot in these predictions. 
 
Karcemarskas - GK 
Last week we saw a total of three goalkeepers make the team of the week, and based off the amount of top draw performances again this week, I can see the pattern continuing. While on paper it looks like Osmanlispor FK cruised to a comfortable 3-0 victory over Alanyaspor, a lot of this was due to fantastic saves from their keeper. Racking up a total of 9 saves, not only did he ensure a clean sheet was kept, but he massively contributed to his team securing the points. 
  
Jong - CB 
Ajax were hosts to PSV in this Eredivisie fixture, and despite PSV being a whole 10 points above the hosts, we were in for a treat. Ajax really brought their top game, and secured all the points with an incredible 3-0 victory over the league leaders. While many had great games, Jong from the CB spot really stood out. Ensuring a clean sheet was kept and also assisting one of the goals, hopefully he has done enough to make the lineup. 
 
Vazquez - CAM 
Moving over to the MLS for this pick and with the cup final being played over the weekend, it would just seem wrong to not pick a player from that match. Toronto were 2-0 winners
over Seattle during this cup final and while a few players put in a great show, the player getting the nod here is their CAM, Vazquez.  
  
Terrier - LW 
Back to Ligue 1 now and Strasbourg were away to Bordeaux. During a comfortable 3-0 victory for the guests, it was Terrier from the LW who really stole the show. Scoring once, assisting another and putting in an almost flawless performance, his spot in this team of the week is truly deserved. 
 
Roofe - RW  
Next up we head back to England's second division, the Championship, where we find QPR at home to Leeds. This time it was the travelling side who stole the show, and in a 3-1 victory they have one man deserving of a little extra praise. From the LW, Roofe managed to score not one, not two, but three of the goals and if a hat-trick isn’t enough to make the team of the week, then I don’t know what could be! 
 
Khayati - CM 
Our next game sees ADO den Haag away to Twente in an incredibly close match. Once more it was the away team who just managed to edge out the win and in a 3-2 victory, it was their CM, Khayati, who really shone the brightest. Scoring twice and assisting the third, its o so close to a hat-trick and a performance like this shouldn’t go unnoticed. 
 
Aouar - CAM 
Back to France now where Lyon travelled to Amiens for their Ligue 1 fixture. Once again it was the travelling team who took all the points and this time it was Lyon's CAM, Aouar, who scored both the goals in a 2-1 victory. 
 
Defoe - ST 
Back across to the Premier League now and we find ourselves with our first possible path to glory card of the week. Crystal Palace were hosts to Bournemouth and although 4 goals were scored, neither team could quite edge out the opposition and secure the win. Defoe however had a great game for Bournemouth, in a rare start he managed to score both their goals and wrap up a point at least. 
  
Mounie - ST 
Staying in the Premier League now where Huddersfield aimed to continue their impressive start to their Premier League campaign. Huddersfield were at home to Brighton this time and thanks to a brilliant performance from their striker Mounie, they managed to secure yet another 3 points. In a 2-0 victory, it was Mounie who found the net twice and with it, earned his spot in these predictions. 
  
Petersen - ST 
With two slots remaining for this week's predictions, we have two fantastic hat-tricks to talk about! The first was found when Freiburg travelled to FC Cologne for this Bundesliga fixture. In a 7-goal thriller, it was the away team who were narrow winners. With the game ending 4-3, Petersen is the hero of the day, and although two of his goals came from the spot, you cannot take this hat-trick away from him! 
  
Aboubakar - ST 
For the final spot this week, we find ourselves picking yet another player from Porto. In a fantastic 5-0 victory, away to Vitoria de Setubal, it was Aboubakar who stole the show. Scoring three times (with 1 from the spot), he ensured Porto took home all the points while also ensuring he earnt a spot in this team of the week too."
PL TOTS Predictions,07-Apr-18 10:37,"Starting Eleven
De Gea 
First up we have arguably the best goalkeeper in the world. While United have strengthened as a whole this season, there have still be moments of pure magic where De Gea has single handedly won his side points. With an average of 3.1 saves a game, a total of 16 clean sheets and just 23 goals conceded in the league so far, he is more than deserving of this first spot.
Walker 
Its clear as day that Manchester City have been an unstoppable force going forward, however what can easily be overlooked is just how solid they have been at the back. With just 1 loss, 3 draws and 21 goals conceded all year, the stats alone show how well organised they are. Walker has been a huge part of this, playing in almost every game and even wracking up 6 assists along the way.
Azpilicueta 
Chelsea have had far from a successful season, however Azpilicueta’s transition from full-back into centre-back seems to be going from strength to strength. With 30 goals conceded in the league and 14 clean sheets, team stats don’t jump out as remarkable however without this man things would be a hell of a lot worse. With 6 assists and even a goal to his name as well, we find yet another reason to include this man.
Otamendi 
We move onto our second Manchester City player and with it, their second defender. Now Otamendi has been a fundamental part of their rise to glory and his 8 yellow cards in the league only show his drive and passion. With four goals and a total of 15 clean sheets so far, it becomes extremely difficult to leave this man out.
Young
Next up we have Ashley Young, yet another piece of United’s defensive puzzle that has preformed fantastically this season. As mentioned above, United have only conceded 23 goals so far this year but Young has not only contributed to his defensive duties, he has also been solid going forward as well. His 2 goals and 3 assists in the league is simply the cherry on the cake and with it he nestles in nicely at LB in these predictions.
De Bruyne 
There are simply no words to describe just how incredible this mans vision and understanding of the game is. Almost everything he touches turns to magic and hence it’s no surprise that De Bruyne leads the league for assists. City have scored 88 goals across their PL campaign and with 7 goals and 15 assists, De Bruyne has been a part of 25% of this. We shouldn’t be talking about whether he makes the TOTS, it should be whether or not he wins POTY.
David Silva
From one incredible midfielder to another now as we move on to David Silva. Now when you order a sandwich, you concentrate on what the filling consists of and very rarely do you take the time to appreciate the bread that holds it together, Silva is that bread. Absolutely fundamental in City’s success however we rarely see his name in the spotlight. His incredible work levels, drive and passion are never lacking, while his 8 goals and 11 assists this season once again prove his importance.
Hazard 
Chelsea have had a difficult season, whether it’s new signings not quite performing as expected or the manager/players losing the passion they had last year, things haven’t gone quite as planned. On top of this Hazard has had the challenge of adapting to central role for the majority of the season and hence his stats aren’t quite as impressive as previous years with just 11 goals and 3 assists. Despite this, his work ethic and passion always shines through, which is why he has 8 man of the match awards and also makes our list.
Salah
What does £37 million get you in the current market? One fifth of Neymar? Roughly a quarter of Coutinho? The left leg of Harry Kane? Well it bought Liverpool 29 Goals, 9 Assists, 8 man of the match awards and a solid POTY candidate. Salah has been nothing but breathtaking since joining Liverpool in the summer and there is no chance that the leagues top scorer doesn’t make this TOTS.
Kane 
Up until his recent injury, Kane and Salah were neck and neck in the race for the golden boot. Every year you think this man may have peaked, he comes out stronger with a new arsenal of tricks and talent to display. Tottenham have scored 62 goals in the league and when one player is responsible for 24 of those alone, you know you’ve found something magical. Even though he sits 5 goals behind in the race for the golden boot, don’t rule this man out quite yet!
Aguero 
Manchester City have scored 88 goals in their league campaign so far and when one man has scored nearly 25% of these, he can’t go unnoticed. With 21 goals, 6 assists and just 22 starts in the league this season, Aguero has been a staple in a dominant City squad. Imagine what this man could have been capable of, with this team, with these players, if he had managed to stay fit for the entire season.

At the start of the season if somebody told you that Burnley would be fighting relegation, most wouldn’t have been too surprised. They exceeded all expectations, currently sitting in 7th place and with a defensive record that directly competes with the top clubs. With 11 clean sheets, only 27 goals conceded and an average of 3.2 saves a match, Pope has been nothing short of incredible this season.
Monreal 
Arsenal have had far from the season both players and fans were hoping for. Currently sitting outside of European spaces, despite some big money transfers, they would need an incredible run of form to even give themselves a chance of this. While their defensive line has been shaky at best, Monreal has really been a diamond in the rough. With 4 goals, 2 assists and a solid average rating across the season, he is Arsenal’s only hope of a blue card this year.
Vertonghen 
Next up is a 30 year old Belgium center-back, who despite changes and rotations throughout the squad has remained consistent and adaptive across the whole season. With 26 goals conceded and 14 clean sheets across the season, Tottenham have shown their strength defensively and Vertonghen has been at the core of this.
Tarkowski 
We have already seen Pope feature in these predictions, but with a backline as solid as Burnley’s this season, leaving out Tarowski would be a criminal offence. The stats speak for themselves, 27 goals conceded and 11 clean sheets, it’s absolutely unbelievable. On top of this, Tarkowski has also wracked up four MOTM awards, further cementing his place in these predictions.
Doucoure
Watford currently sit comfortably in the middle of the table and with only 6 games remaining it feels sensible to assume they are safe. Doucoure has been absolutely vital to their safety and a total machine in midfield. With 7 goals and 2 assists to his name he plays a part going forward, but with his endless stamina and box to box mentality he has also been a rock defensively too. Competition for spaces is tougher than ever this year, however I believe he may have just done enough.
Eriksen
We have already touched on Tottenham’s goal scoring record but what we haven’t looked at is just how fundamental Eriksen was to this success. With 8 assists and 8 goals across the season, his stats simply don’t do him justice. Creative movements and moments of inspiration often start with Eriksen and this is the reason he just has to make the list.
Fernandinho 
City already have around a billion players included within these predictions, so including yet another was an incredibly tough decision. Now while we have spoken about their top defensive players or goal-scorers, what we are yet to look at is the glue that holds everything together. Fernandinho has been absolutely phenomenal this season, controlling the midfield, defensively dominant and has even scored 3 and assisted another 3 along the way.
Sterling 
As a Liverpool fan it pains me to include this youngster, but nobody can deny just how incredible his development and improvement has been this season. Sterling has been a part of over 25% of Manchester City’s Goals in the league, scoring 16 and assisting a further 7 of the 88 scored so far. He is surely one of the front runners for the young POTY award and hence simply has to make this lineup as well.
Sane 
From one Manchester City youngster to another now, where we find the young German superstar Sane. With 9 goals and 11 assists across the season, this man will be directly competing with Sterling for that young POTY award and while his best form may have been in Europe, his contribution in the league is simply too impressive to ignore.
Mahrez
Leicester aren’t quite the side they were a couple of years back when they won the league and have struggled to replace some of the quality they lost. A few superstars still remain though and Mahrez certainly fits into this category. Leicester have scored 47 goals in the league this year and Mahrez has played a part in 18 of those. With 10 goals and 8 assists surely Mahrez deserves his spot amongst the elite.
Firmino 
As a Liverpool fan, words cannot explain just how important this player is to the club. Firmino has been at the heart of everything this season and while his goal scoring record may not match that of Salah’s, the role he has played has been the foundation of what Liverpool have built. Talking figures though, Firmino has still provided 14 goals and 7 assists which is yet another reason we see him standing strong in this line-up.
Lukaku 
After his big money summer transfer, people were expecting Lukaku to literally revolutionise football as we know it. The reality is that expectations were clearly set too high, Lukaku is still young and although his season wasn’t what people hoped for, it was still incredibly solid. Manchester United have scored 60 in the league so far this season and when we consider that Lukaku has been a part of over a third of these, it suddenly becomes clear just how important he was. With 15 goals and 7 assists to his name, I believe we will be seeing a blue Lukaku in a matter of weeks.
Honorable mentions
Ederson 
Leaving this man out was extremely difficult, but with EA only usually choosing two goal-keepers and with the amount of City players already featuring, he sadly just fell short.
Davies
This guy has been sensational for Tottenham at the back and while he may not be included in the predictions, I don’t think anybody would be complaining if he ended up stealing a spot.
Robertson 
Defensively sound for Liverpool and his improvement across the season has been remarkable. The one concern would be his lack of game time towards the start of the season and goals compared to others.
Mustafi
Mustafi has had some fantastic games this season, however he has also had some absolute nightmares. Sites such as whoscored rate him very highly across the year though, and this could be enough to see him sneak in.
Matic
Matic has once again done what Matic does best, basically everything. Once again he has been incredibly solid, holding down the midfield and standing strong in front of the defence. Seeing him sneak in wouldn’t be a bad decision, it just feels that others have done more.
Mooy
Mooy has had yet another great season in the centre of Huddersfield’s squad. The issue we face once again is that others were simply stronger across the year.
Son
Now this one is gonna cost me. Leaving Son out of the initial squad will cause uproar across the FIFA community, however if we are totally honest, he probably falls just short. Now we could see him squeeze in, and we wouldn’t complain at all, but based on stats and performances, he falls just short for me."
Hashtag Ryan’s FIFA 18 Tips And Story - FUT FM Episode 37,07-Feb-18 09:52,"Hello comrades, welcome to FUT FM on FUTBIN! 
FUT FM is a FIFA podcast focusing on in depth discussions about the game, and the culture surrounding it.
Oh, and we like to bantz. A lot. But don’t take it from me, here’s what some of our totally real and not at all bribed listeners have to say on iTunes:
 


 
Ok, ok, that’s enough introduction, let’s get on on with FUT FM Episode 37, featuring the incredible Hashtag Ryan:
 

 
Weekend League Tips From Hashtag Ryan

If you’re a FIFA 18 regular, you know that a metric buttload of goals get scored in the Weekend League. So how the heck did Hashtag Ryan only concede 20??
No, Ryan’s secret isn’t a 4G connection or a team worth 20 million coins…
In fact, his “secret” isn’t even a secret!
When Hashtag Ryan plays poorly and takes a loss in the Weekend League, he recognizes the situation and takes a break instead of trying to soldier through a sea of negative emotions. It’s really difficult to maintain a high level of play over 40 games if you don’t take time to “reset” yourself after a rough spell.
Furthermore, Ryan has been really enjoying the 4411 formation.
4411 forces you to be a bit more creative on offense, resulting in movements and passing combinations that most FIFA 18 players may not anticipate easily. If you’re not sure about how to set up your team with this formation, check out FUTBIN’s in depth Squad Builder and tweet us your squads/questions.
 
What Was The FUT Champions Cup In Barcelona Really Like?

Everyone and their nan had an opinion about the Barcelona FIFA eWorld Cup event, but was it really as uneven as some made it sound?
Unfortunately, Ryan points out that Day 1 was a bit shambolic. The following is a live photo of Twitter’s reaction to some of the things that went on:


 
The Swiss format got messed up which resulted in incorrect match ups, and the pros had to mass discard items from their clubs in order to get to the ones they needed. Wait times for matches were long.
Buuuut, Day 2 was a huge improvement! Shout out to the guy on stage using a Swiffer as a broom.
In terms of the spectator experience, this event had its ups and downs. Obviously Hashtag Boras on commentary was a huge highlight for everyone, but fans wanted to see more top matches, and a clearer picture of the brackets and overall tournament.
With FIFA 18 pushing hard into the esports scene, some growing pains are to be expected.
FIFA 18 Esports version gameplay and playing vs DhTekKz & Kurt
 
Do the pros play the same game that we do?
 

Actually, the pros play the FIFA 18 esports version which features all FUT cards and different gameplay. As Hashtag Ryan and other pros have pointed out, the game is much slower, which potentially suits the more conservative nature of pro vs pro matchups. In fact, Ryan called the gameplay even slower than kick off matches.
Is that a good thing, or is that a bad thing?
There’s no clear cut answer, but both Ryan and Kurt feel that faster gameplay lends itself better to a more skill-based game. And both of them played against each other in Barcelona!
Ryan has nothing but love for Kurt, praising his incredible dribbling ability and calling him the best player he’s seen.
As for TekKz, Ryan called his skills absolutely insane! TekKz played with no fear and treated every match like a home game, attacking relentlessly and with freedom and creativity. TekKz also used his attackers on defense a lot, cutting out key passes and options.
The biggest thing Ryan learned from Barcelona is to add a bit of patience to his game, since typically he’s playing very directly and smashing WL players into first half rage quits.
 
Hashtag Ryan’s Pro Journey And The Ultimate Rage Moment

Ryan’s story is hilarious and amazing:
He’s always played a bunch of FIFA, and one day he got emailed that he was on reserve for a tournament in Madrid.
He thought it was a scam! In a month or two later, he qualified for an event in Munich, won it, and it all started from there.
BUT, he almost never made it to Munich! His mom initially refused to let him go to Germany and didn’t think any of this esports stuff was real or worth Ryan’s time. Study hard, kids!
Eventually, Ryan signed with xL on a short contract and after that was approached by Spencer and Hashtag. It’s a bit of a dream come true for Ryan, having always watched Spencer’s videos as a fan in the past. Plus, working with the likes of Boras, Agge, and Harry would be a dream for any serious FIFA player.
In fact, Ryan credits his colleagues for teaching him how to stay calm and maintain his form over a long period of time, because…
Ryan once broke his own bed due to FIFA rage! Seriously. He threw his laptop down and BOOM, his bed exploded into three million pieces.

Maybe I’m exaggerating a bit here, but he did actually break his bed. Be sure to share your own FIFA rage stories with us on Twitter.
 
Hashtag Ryan’s Thoughts On FIFA 18 And The Future

It’s probably fair to say that FIFA 18 has been a very divisive game in the hardcore and pro communities.
Should the Weekend League format change? Is the gameplay where it needs to be? What’s up with the defending? The questions pile on, and everyone has an opinion and a half.
Overall, Ryan thinks FIFA 18 blows FIFA 17 out of the water… but only when the gameplay is smooth. Even in his latest Weekend League, the gameplay was varying wildly in his 5 bar matches. But ultimately, it’s still better than the AI defending in 17.
He’d like to see more consistency from the gameplay in FIFA 19, alongside a different format for the pros. The Weekend League format is simply not a good fit.
Perhaps as FIFA grows an esport, we’ll see more pro leagues similar to games like Overwatch, CSGO, and StarCraft. In fact, we’re seeing the seeds of that right now with the eMLS and the announcement of the virtual Bundesliga.
One thing is clear though, the Weekend League format needs to be changed for the sake of everyone.
Comrades, thank you so much for checking out FUT FM, I hope you had fun listening to Episode 37 and reading the article! We’ll be back next week.

NOVEMBER - POTM INVESTMENTS,28-Nov-17 13:04,"So, the month of November has finally come to a close, well in terms of the Premier League fixtures at least, and while there have been some fantastic performances across the month, a list of realistic candidates can be named on a single hand.  
 
Now while we could spend time writing about the possible nominations, potential options of who may make the shortlist and investments surrounding these players, this time, in this month, I feel like we would be wasting everybody's precious time. Let's be honest, there is one man who has had a month far superior to that of anybody else's, and to see him not take home the award would be nothing short of a travesty.   
   
Mohamed Salah 
To say that Liverpool are a team in form would be an outright lie. From wasting a 3-0 lead in the champions league to simply conceding in almost every Premier League game they play, it is clear their defense is struggling. 
  
This being said, a handful of attacking players have really stood out this year. One man in particular has been so impressive, that he currently leads the top scorer list and is the clear frontrunner for this month's award. 
 
04/11/2017 
West Ham 1 - 4 Liverpool 
Goals: 2 
Assists: 0 
Match Rating: 8.8 
  
18/11/2017 
Liverpool 3 - 0 Southampton 
Goals: 2 
Assists: 0 
Match Rating: 8.4 
  
25/11/2017 
Liverpool 1 - 1 Chelsea 
Goals: 1 
Assists: 0 
Match Rating: 7.7 
  
28/11/2017 
Stoke 0 - 3 Liverpool 
Goals: 2 
Assists: 0 
Match Rating: 8.0 
  
 Over a total of 4 games this month, Salah had 3 starts and most recently came on as a super sub in the fourth and final game against Stoke. Liverpool picked up a total of 10 points from 12 and scored a total of 11 goals, Salah himself provided 7 of these. For a right winger, scoring a goal a game is extremely impressive, Salah has practically doubled that and looking past him for a possible Player Of The Month is simply absurd. 
 
Investments
Now while we may be looking at making investments around this event, we also need to remember that prices will already be inflated as others have already picked up the cards they see as viable. Due to this it is extremely important that we are using tools such as the FUTBIN price graph, to ensure we aren’t buying at massively inflated prices and that we can still squeeze fantastic profit margins out of things for ourselves. 
 
NIF Premier League Players: Fairly simple here, we have often seen the requirements for these challenges include an X rated premier league squad. The only question we need to answer is the potential rating of this squad, if it were to be included again. Picking up 84+ rated players when the prices are right could provide a risk-free investment method that also is applicable for other challenges along the way. 
 
Inform Premier League Players: Within the above requirements, we have also previously seen the requirement of a PL inform card to be used. Once again this is a fairly simple and straight forward investment route, aim to pick up such cards for as little as possible but ensure you take the rating into consideration as well. 
 
Egyptian Players: Player prices here are already super inflated and you don’t need to be any sort of expert to predict why! If we are looking at taking this investment route, I suggest returning to tried and tested methods such as sniping, mass bidding or buying during rewards. 
 
NIF Gold Liverpool Players: We saw this last year and the trend has carried across to FIFA 18 as well. Players from the winner's club have often been part of the requirements and with Liverpool having a limited supply of 82+ players, it becomes fairly easy to see where the best choices may lie. Again, if this is the route you take, be wary of prices and try not to overpay. 
 
NIF Salah: Salah was 4,000 coins a few days back, he now sits comfortably at 8,000 coins and higher. This is not simply due to a significant rise in demand, this is simply down to investors picking him up already. If this is an option we believe is viable, we need to be sniping him where possible, paying a lot less than his current market value. 
 
Special Salah: So far this year we have seen a total of 3 special Salah cards (OTW, Hero and Inform), personally I just don't feel like there is enough supply on the market to warrant such a requirement being used, however you may disagree and hence it gets a mention here. 
 
NIF Gold Basel Players: Salah played for Basel between 2012-2014 and past clubs is a requirement we have seen EA jump to time and time again. Not a lot needs to be said here, if we are choosing this route for investments, aim for the highest rating possible for the lowest possible price. 
 
Inform Basel Players / Inform RSL Players: Looking at this category and we face a similar problem to the availability of Special Salah cards, there simply isn't enough. There are currently two informs from Basel, Lang and Elyounoussi. Now while I don’t believe EA could use a requirement such as this, it doesn't mean that hype won't raise their prices as we get closer to the event and people begin preparing. 
 
NIF Gold Chelsea Players: Salah was at Chelsea between 2014-2016, and while he may have only played 13 games (he spent most of his time out on loan) it still provides a viable investment routes. Again, just like before, we want to be looking at the best rating possible for the most realistic price if this is our method of choice. 
 
Inform Chelsea Players: We have covered Premier League Informs above, and if we decide to look specifically at Chelsea players, we will find we are limited to just the four. Batshuayi provides the cheapest option, Morata the second, Azpilicueta is third in line and finally Hazard provides an unrealistic investment choice. Once again, I personally see this investment as unlikely to be needed, but if you do choose this route, hype is an investors best friend. 
 
NIF Gold Fiorentina Players: During Salah's time at Chelsea, his first loan spell was to Fiorentina. Again, if we are aiming to cover all bases or even if this is the investment option we choose, aim for the highest rated players for the lowest possible cost. 
 
Inform Fiorentina Players / Inform Serie A Players: If you decide that Inform Fiorentina players is your choice of investment, you are going to become extremely rich. Now this isn't because it will be included within the challenge, it's simply because these cards just don’t exist! Instead, we could be turning our attention to other special cards from within the league. Always aim for a decent rating if this is your preferred method of investment, but also consider how you could be linking them up if a hybrid is required, factors such as nationality and position could be important. 
 
NIF Gold Roma Players: Once more we really don’t need to go into depth with this option, highest rating possible for the lowest cost you can find! 
 
Inform Roma Players / Inform Serie A Players: Seeing as we have covered informs from the league above, we will simply focus on Roma informs here. There are three possible informs from Roma; Kolarov, El Shaarawy and Nanggolan. Once again, this just seems like an unviable requirement for the actual challenge as supply is simply too limited, and nobody is ever going to submit an IF Nainggolan into the SBC anyway. Investments here should be bought for hype again. 
 
NIF Gold November Opponent Players: Another feature we have seen EA include in the past, cards from the opponents Liverpool played in the month of November. This one is straight forward and investments here really don’t need an explanation.
 
NIF Gold Champions League Group Players: Last month we saw EA include a completely different challenge, featuring past POTM winners. This option allows us to look outside the box once again and consider a different route they could take. Liverpool's group consists of Sevilla, NK Maribor and Spartak Moscow. If you decide on this route, it should be risk free and simply cover and outsider possibility."
October - POTM contenders so far,24-Oct-17 15:35,"We have one game week left in the month of October which can only mean one thing, the next player of the month award is only a couple of weeks away! With the international fixtures this month, we will only see 3 matches per team, which only emphasises the importance of consistently strong performances. So with just the games on the weekend left, who is currently leading this race?
All match ratings used are taken directly from whoscored.
The Month So Far
Harry Kane
14th October 207
Tottenham 1 - 0 Bournemouth
0 Goals, 0 Assists, 6.8 Rating
22nd October 2017
Tottenham 4 - 1 Liverpool
2 Goals, 1 Assist, 9.4 Rating
28th October 2017
Manchester United ? - ? Tottenham
With a less than impressive performance against Bournemouth Kane really has a lot left to achieve in his final game against Manchester United. After a world class showing against Liverpool, a repeat performance against another top club could see him edge out the competition who have a much easier fixture list. This being said, it really needs to be world class with a few goals thrown in for good measure.
Kevin De Bruyne
14th October 2017
Manchester City 7 - 2 Stoke
0 Goals, 2 Assists, 8.7 Rating
21st October 2017
Manchester City 3 - 0 Burnley
0 Goals, 1 Assist, 8.4 Rating
28th October 2017
West Brom ? - ? Manchester City
Manchester City have been an unstoppable force recently, and if the pace continues we could see all kinds of goal scoring records demolished. This being said, it isn't always the player who taps the ball into the net who deserves the credit. De Bruyne has been fundamental to the success, his vision and ability to read the game seems to improve in each match. The only thing he lacks this month is Goals to his name, a goal or a couple of assists again in this final match could see him edge out the competition.
Leroy Sane
14th October 2017
Manchester City 7 - 2 Stoke
1 Goal, 1 Assist, 8.9 Rating
21st October 2017
Manchester City 3 - 0 Burnley
1 Goal, 1 Assist, 8.6 Rating
28th October 2017
West Brom ? - ? Manchester City
It has been far from smooth sailing for the Manchester City players when it comes to making the starting lineup. With a number of wide players to choose from, alongside the option of two striker setups or a larger midfield, there is no guarantees as it stands. This month however Sane has put forward a strong argument as to why he should be included, and with 2 goals and 2 assists so far, a starting spot against West Brom may be all he needs to wrap up this player of the month award too.

Conclusion
Whichever way we look at things, the race is still on and open to others outside of this shortlist. The truth is though, that we will need to see a miraculous performance from somebody who has already had a solid month to overtake these guys, and that's before they even play their own games."
REVIEW - TOTS LOZANO,21-May-18 06:09,"Hirving Rodrigo Lozano Bahena, better known as Satan, or God, depending on which team he is playing for.  From the moment Chucky Lozano earned his first inform he has been a go to super sub for numerous FUT Managers.  Terrorizing backlines with his pace and finishing ability that has resulted in numerous rants and/or humblebrags about epic comebacks. Which brings me to a confession; I seriously could not get on with either the 82 or 84 IF Lozano cards and I sold both shortly after buying them.  They were not as advertised and in my opinion were a result of massive overhype and circumstance. Perhaps they just didn’t fit my playstyle?  With the release of the new and improved 89 TOTS Lozano I was willing to subscribe to the “third times a charm” mentality and give him a final go.  But I couldn’t help but wonder; To sub, or not to sub: that is the question. 
I decided I would play Lozano in 20 matches.  15 as a starter. 5 as a super sub.  Through this process I hoped to determine his value in both situations and ultimately decided if I was a believer or non-believer in the third coming of Lozano.   Lozano was the lightning rod in the following squad:

 
PACE
The Mexican rattlesnake is always ready to strike opponents when they are vulnerable.  There are very few cards in FIFA 18 that have the acceleration that Lozano possess.  The second you go to accelerate he is moving and does not have the moment of hesitation that you will experience in some players.  Additionally, this card is very quick to react to loose balls and rebounds in and around the penalty area.  While I did not score any rebound goals in my 20 games with Lozano, I was able to keep many attacking chances alive that would later lead to goals.  It goes without saying that Lozano has pace to burn, but I noticed he has even more than other quick players I have used.
RATING: 5/5
 
SHOOTING
Now this was the category I was looking forward to when I purchased TOTS Lozano.  I have read the endless posts of people dominating with X number of goals in X number of games using Lozano.  As previously stated this was not my experience with past Lozano IFs and the main reason was a lack of finishing.  I would love to say that this version of Lozano was a revelation and I was ripping the net apart all Weekend League long.  But I can’t.  Once again I found Lozano’s finishing to be lack luster and should be goals were blasting past the posts and into the crowd endangering everyone.  One plus is that his FOUR STAR WEAK FOOT is really good and I ended up favouring his left near the end of my trial.  My parting word is that this is my first review where I did not finish the entire weekend league with a player I was reviewing and it was 100% due to Lozano’s finishing.
RATING: 3.5/5
 
PASSING
88 PASSING does not do Lozano’s ability on the ball justice and neither does the 9 assists in 20 games that his stats show.  Immediately I noticed a huge difference in Lozano’s passing from his previous IFs and this was the area he impacted my squad the most.  While he may not have played the final ball on all of my goals, it does not change the fact that Lozano’s passing is really solid and he can cut apart your opponents back line.  This card reminds me of SBC KDB in that sometimes the passes he plays are even better than I envisioned and always at the perfect weight that opposing defenders cannot get there.
RATING: 4/5
 
DRIBBLING, DEFENDING & PHYSICAL
I have read numerous reviews of the various Aguero cards and the comment they all have in common revolves about the player architype that you expect when you buy a card.  You expect Aguero’s card to be tiny and weak; and then you start a match and realize he looks solid and at least three or four inches taller than his card suggests.  Lozano has a similar architype and in the end he plays like he is 6 feet tall.  When you match this body type and the pace Lozano has, his dribbling, defending, and physical make him a well-rounded weapon for any squad to unleash.  One example I can share is that I usually average 1 penalty during a full Weekend League.  This weekend, I had 5 in the 20 games I played with Lozano and all of them were fouls on him.  The best compliment I can give this card is that Lozano dribbles like a 5’8 speedster, which he is.  But then you look at the player architype and you realize you have a tank flying around the pitch causing havoc.  His 74 STRENGTH is a complete farce and I was tossing defenders around the pitch like Hulk Hogan in his prime.  The amount of headers, tackles, and shoulder challenges that I won this weekend with Lozano was not fair.  He should not be winning the majority of these battles, but he does anyway.
DRIBBLING RATING: 5/5
DEFENDING RATING: 4/5
PHYSICAL RATING: 4/5

FINALE SCORE
RATING: 3.8/5
As foreshadowed earlier in my review, my rating is not flattering for TOTS Lozano and I still can’t get on with this card.  There are so many players worth 200k or less that are the same or better (84 IF Lozano for instance).  If I was in the driver’s seat and dominating my opponent: Lozano was banging in hat tricks.  If the game was close and a chance broke for my ST: Lozano was slamming shots off the face of un-expecting fans.  I cannot recommend this card with the inflated price tag it has; and while I know there are FUT Mangers out there lighting the world on fire with this card, I suggest that they are good enough that they could do the same with anyone else.  TOTS Lozano does not improve your squad the way so many other options can.  However, I do want to spend a few seconds on one part of Lozano that was incredible, and most would expect it goes the other way, however... TOTS Arias is unbelievable!  I think he rivals and surpasses 85 IF Valencia and that is a massive shout.  I could not get over how effective this card was and I repeat, he would surpass my Valencia in the starting lineup if he linked better.  In the end the hard link to TOTS Arias is the only reason I was contemplating holding on to Lozano, and even that wasn’t enough.  In conclusion, send me your hybrids with TOTS Arias.
Cheers for reading!

We get this question a lot.
A lot of hardcore players are at a point in the game in which their teams are locked for a long time to come, due to to the high cost of a meaningful upgrade.
As the progression and team building slows down, so does interest in the game. At that point, you have to ask yourself what you come to FIFA for.
For Valerio, it’s about getting a minimum of 36 wins and becoming a pro.
For Nelly, it’s about solving SBCs creatively and creating the ultimate Serbian team.
For Goran, it’s about having fun and trying to be the best he can be.
 


Your goal might be different, and that’s perfectly ok. Enjoy the video game you bought in the way you want to enjoy it! And if you don’t have a goal in mind, try setting something that is attainable and somewhat realistic.
You don’t walk into a gym expecting a 6 pack in a week. By that token, you shouldn’t expect to get Prime Icon R9 in a week if you have barely any coins.
At the end of the day, if you don’t get enjoyment out of playing a video game, or you find it too glitchy, it’s also okay to take a break or stop. It’ll always be there if you ever want to come back.
Here are some ideas to keep FUT fresh for yourself:


Switch formations once a week.


Build and play with a new team that doesn’t use any of your current team’s players.


Play with a team made up strictly with players from your country.


Look up other people’s tactics on r/SeriousFIFA and try them out.


Play with a FUTBIN community squad.

FUT Birthday Florenzi Is An All Around Beast
 


Wow, who knew that a +4 difference could be so big?!
Our very own Valerio was able to get FUT Birthday Florenzi and has been using him alongside Patrick Vieira in his midfield.
And boy oh boy, Florenzi just annihilates the opposition. He’s rated 84+ in most attributes, with only his strength, heading, and accuracy being between 70 and 80. That alone tells you what kind of player he is.
With his wonderful balance and agility, you’ll rarely find FUT Birthday Florenzi in a situation that exposes his lack of pure strength. In fact, his explosiveness and ball control ensure that you can truly use him as an attacking player in FIFA 18.
He can finish, he can pass, he can dribble, and he’s fast. He’s almost the perfect FIFA player!
The only downside to Florenzi is that he has a 3 star weak foot and no traits. But with attributes that good, does that really matter for you? Let us know on Twitter.

SBC Kaka Is Easily One Of The Best FUT Players... For 45 Minutes
 


Goran has been singing the praises of SBC Kaka, 45 minutes at a time.
Kaka can do everything and has the finesse shot trait. He’s a CAM with incredible finishing, dribbling, and passing. Plus, he’s just one of those players with the right mix of body type and animation that makes him feel “smooth” to use.
With the stay forward player instruction, Kaka is as close as you can get to having a guaranteed start of a decent attack in FIFA 18.
Kaka rocks!
Kaka also has 55 stamina, he’s a 45 minute player.
Having this legend in your team effectively means that you need to spend the coins on another amazing player that can come off the bench and influence the game. Keep in mind that benched players don’t get the full chemistry boosts, ensuring that SBC Kaka was never as cheap as he seemed…
 
Prime Icon Ronaldo Might As Well Be A Cheat

When Valerio managed to complete Prime Icon Ronaldo for 2.7 million coins (current price is 3.5), he was ecstatic.
When Valerio managed to use R9 in game, well, no language can describe his emotions.
You already know R9 is on another level, so it’s easier to talk about what he’s NOT good at instead of focusing on his strengths.
He’s not good at long passing and defending. That’s literally it.
As long as you’re a reasonable distance from goal and can power your shot correctly, you can score with Ronaldo. It doesn’t matter if it’s a finesse shot or if you drive it across the ground, the ball goes in. In fact, it’s harder to miss with R9 than score, provided you’re taking decent shots of course.
It’s a little mind blowing that a very small and very vocal part of the community thinks this card is no good. Maybe they want to lower his price? Maybe they’re jelly? Who knows?
Interestingly enough, Valerio points out that it’s absurd to have a card this good in a game that’s supposed to be competitive. This has been a challenge that FUT has faced since its inception, for example, 95+ cards become available relatively quickly and begin to stretch the limits of gameplay.

OTW - Week Four,04-Oct-17 14:24,"This week sees an international break, with the remaining qualifying games for the 2018 WC being played over the upcoming days. Frustratingly, this sees a lot of OTW cards missing some vital minutes and hence really limits our opportunity for investments. This doesn't mean that we can't find the value amongst them though. Also remember that when a player isn't playing, the prices can drop rather dramatically, this could be a chance to invest for the following week as an alternative.
 
Neymar (PSG)
05/10/2017
Bolivia vs Brazil
11/10/2017
Brazil vs Chile
Off the back of a fantastic performance for PSG, somehow Neymar is still yet to receive his first inform card. With Brazil playing Bolivia in the first international game, Neymar has a real chance to shine as goals should be flowing! In reality though, how many of us can afford him anyway?
 
Bonucci (AC Milan)
06/10/2017
Italy vs FYR Macedonia
09/10/2017
Albania vs Italy
With Italy currently 3 points behind Spain and a 17 goal swing also present, wins from both games are needed while hoping Spain slip up twice. There is no reason for Bonucci not to start and Italy go into both matches as strong favourites. He can shoot, is strong in the air and solid at the back, against these weaker opponents an inform is possible.
 
Lukaku (Manchester United)
07/10/2017
Bosnia vs Belgium
10/10/2017
Belgium vs Cyprus
Although Belgium have already locked up the top spot in the group, there is no reason not to play a strong team and get some more minutes under their belts. Lukaku has been a regular starter for Belgium, is on fire for Manchester United and with a +32 GD so far, we can only assume plenty more goals are to come. The question is, who will be scoring them?
 
Rodriguez (Bayern Munich)
06/10/2017
Columbia vs Paraguay
11/10/2017
Peru vs Columbia
From the La Liga champions to the Bundesliga champions, Rodriguez has seen his fair share of top flight football and it doesn't stop with his country. Currently sitting third in the table, Colombia are on track for qualification and with Paraguay and Peru hot on their heels, they will be playing their strongest team. We know what Rodriguez is capable of, but what can he find when it matters?
 

Morata (Chelsea)
06/10/2017
Spain vs Albania
09/10/2017
Israel vs Spain
After a fantastic start for Chelsea and Diego Costa's lack of play time, a starting spot for Spain looked highly likely. Sadly fate didn't quite agree, with an injury ruling him out for roughly 6 weeks, an inform isn't going to happen any time soon.
 
Lacazette (Arsenal)
07/10/2017
Bulgaria vs France
10/10/2017
France vs Belarus
Currently still finding his feet in the Premier League, Lacazette usually finds himself as a late substitute for his country. With France sitting just one point clear at the top of the table, it feels unlikely this will change and without the minutes on the pitch, an inform becomes extremely unlikely.
 
Walker (Manchester City)
05/10/2017
England vs Slovenia
08/10/2017
Lithuania vs England
While Slovenia are fighting for qualification, Lithuania have nothing left to gain. Walker is a regular starter for England, in a formation that allows him to get forward. There is a strong chance of clean sheets across both games and if Walker can also bag himself a goal or a couple of assists, an inform is definitely possible.
 
Salah (Liverpool)
08/10/2017
Egypt vs Congo
Despite missing several strong chances, Salah has flourished at Liverpool so far having already bagged himself several goals. Top of the table Egypt host bottom of the table Congo is this fixture, and if anyone is likely to put in a star performance, Salah has to make the list.
 
Ederson (Manchester City)
05/10/2017
Bolivia vs Brazil
11/10/2017
Brazil vs Chile
The new Manchester City keeper has already provided some much needed solidity at the back for his club, however when it comes to Brazil he finds himself lucky to even make the bench. As a goalkeeper especially if he isn't starting, he is unlikely to find himself on the pitch and hence isn't the greatest option for the following weeks games.
 
Mbappe (PSG)
07/10/2017
Bulgaria vs France
10/10/2017
France vs Belarus
Mbappe appears to be perfectly suited to top flight football, showing no difficulties immediately sliding into the starting eleven at PSG. With the international games taking over this week, the key concern is game time. While he started the last, a second half substitution is fairly common.
 
Sigurdsson (Everton)
06/10/2017
Turkey vs Iceland
09/10/2017
Iceland vs Kosovo
Following his big money move from Swansea to Everton, Sigurdsson is yet to find any real form this year. However, Iceland currently sit second in an extremely competitive group of which Sigurdsson is a key component. With a game against Turkey and then bottom of the table Kosovo, is this where he will recapture his previous form?
 
Costa (Juventus)
05/10/2017
Bolivia vs Brazil
11/10/2017
Brazil vs Chile
A youngster with so much potential, however Costa has found himself passed around clubs almost every season while struggling to hold down a starting spot. This doesn't change when it comes to Brazil either with the youngster struggling to even make the squad. Once again, there should be stronger options elsewhere.
 
Bernardeschi (Juventus)
06/10/2017
Italy vs FYR Macedonia
09/10/2017
Albania vs Italy
After a solid performance for his new club, Bernardeschi is commonly used as a very late substitute for Italy and there are no signs that this is about to change. The concern around minutes on the pitch is once again present and would leave him needing something spectacular to squeeze his way into the TOTW.
 
Kieta Balde Diao (Monaco)
07/10/2017
Cape Verde vs Senegal
A win here for Senegal would launch them to the top of their group, ahead of Burkina Faso. Blade is commonly used as an impact substitution and again the lack of minutes is the largest worry. With the reduction of game time for Monaco as well, it seems unlikely this will change.
 
Tolisso (Bayern Munich)
07/10/2017
Bulgaria vs France
10/10/2017
France vs Belarus
After a successful season in Ligue 1 and a big move to Bundesliga champions Munich, Tolisso's next challenge is to secure a spot in his national team. While he occasionally makes the bench, finding game time has been difficult and with these last two games crucial in securing the top spot, it remains unlikely to change.
 
Yarmolenko (Dortmund)
06/10/2017
Kosovo vs Ukraine
09/10/2017
Ukraine vs Croatia
One of the tightest groups in qualification with just two points separating the top four. Fresh off a man of the match performance for Dortmund with a goal and an assist, Yarmolenko is currently on fire. He is a regular starter and with the first game against bottom of the table Kosovo, there is every opportunity of a big game.
 
Aurier (Tottenham)
06/10/2017
Mali vs Ivory Coast
Aurier has had a rocky start for his new club this season, already finding himself with a red card to his name. As a regular starter for Ivory Coast, he travels to bottom of the table Mali who have managed just one goal across four games. Sadly that goal came against Ivory Coast, but a clean sheet and a strong influence here could see him sneak into the TOTW.
 
Bruma (RB Leipzig)
07/10/2017
Andorra vs Portugal
10/10/2017
Portugal vs Switzerland
The young Portuguese winger is yet to find his first start for his countries senior squad, and with a tight battle going on for the top spot, this is very unlikely to change. Due to this any investments in hope of a price bump this week, would not be the smartest approach.
 
Sanchez (Tottenham)
06/10/2017
Columbia vs Paraguay
11/10/2017
Peru vs Columbia
Sanchez is slowly finding his feet in the Premier League and gradually finding himself with more and more minutes as a result. His presence in the starting eleven for Columbia has been on and off over the past year, and goals have not been his forte. Can this change against Paraguay?
 
Semedo (Barcelona)
07/10/2017
Andorra vs Portugal
10/10/2017
Portugal vs Switzerland
Following his big summer transfer to Barcelona, the next hurdles for Semedo include both making the Barcelona and Portuguese starting eleven. Usually used as a late substitution and with Portugal desperately trying to close the gap on Switzerland, any immediate starting spot feels unlikely at best.
 
Traore (Lyon)
07/10/2017
South Africa vs Burkina Faso

Fresh from the Premier League champions, Traore seems to have secured his starting role at Lyon. With Burka Faso in tight competition for the groups top spot Traore remains a key influence and a regular starter. The question is, what can he manage against bottom of the group South Africa?
 
Kessie (AC Milan)
06/10/2017
Mali vs Ivory Coast
Ivory Coast currently lead their group and this weeks fixture sees them travel to bottom of the table Mali. Kessie has been a regular starter for his country, so game time shouldn't be the issue, but what exactly can he pull out the bag on Friday?
 
Hernandez (Real Madrid)
07/10/2017
Bulgaria vs France
10/10/2017
France vs Belarus
Hernandez is currently left out of the starting eleven for Madrid, so when it comes to making the insanely competitive French squad, it becomes even more unlikely. With such a low chance of making the squad, let alone the starting eleven, it becomes near impossible to obtain an inform this week regardless of his countries results.
 
As mentioned before, without be guarantees of players obtaining game time, investments immediately become limited. If we are smart, look for the hidden gems, react to lineup announcements or plan in advance for the following weeks, investments are always available and coins can always be made!"
TOTW15 Predictions,25-Dec-17 16:06,"Starting Eleven
Consigli 
Sassuolo were hosts to Inter Milan in a game that everybody expected the away side to win. In an incredibly tight match, it took a few magical moments from their keeper Consigli, to ensure the game remained in the hosts hands. Things finished 1-0, with a saved penalty being the real talking point.
Martinez 
Real Sociedad were at home to Sevilla for this Wednesday night match and once again it was the home team who took all the glory. During a 3-1 victory it was their LB, Martinez, who really stood out. With a solid performance all round, a goal and an assist, hopefully he has done enough.
Benatia 
Two of the top teams within the Serie A went face to face this Saturday as Juventus were hosts to Roma. In a tight battle from start to finish, it was the home side who managed to edge out a 1-0 victory. Ensuring a clean sheet was kept and scoring the winner, Benatia at CB is our clear cut choice here.
Jagielka 
Moving over to England next where we find an inform Everton team play hosts to last years champions Chelsea. While the game ended 0-0, the match was anything but even. Chelsea managed a total of 25 shots with 8 on target, which Everton managed just 5, with 0 on target. Jagielka pulled off 2 goal line clearances during the draw and if we don’t see him sneak in, we will most likely find Pickford included.
Lukaku 
Moving over to Italy now where an Inform Lazio were hosts to relegation battling Crotone. Once again, in true Lazio style, they were on a goal rampage, finishing the match as 4-0 victors. Lukaku from the left was the stand out star, locking down the game while also scoring himself a goal.
Mata 
Manchester United were on a way to Leicester for their weekend fixture and despite going 1-0 down, things looked comfortable during the final few seconds after 2 fantastic goals from Mata. A piece of brilliance in the final seconds saw Maguire bag an equaliser for the hosts, so if we don’t see Mata, we have another option!
Mbappe 
PSG have had a fantastic season so far, sitting comfortable atop the Ligue 1 table and comfortable clear of any rivals. Midweek they were hosts to Caen and in yet another comfortable 3-1 victory, they ensured their dominance continued. The star of the show was once again Mbappe, scoring once and assisting another. The only concern would be, is this enough for a third special card already?
Choupo-Moting 
Stoke were at home to West Brom for their Saturday fixture and a win was desperately needed. Luckily the hosts were pumped up on Christmas spirits and secured the points in a 3-1 victory. Choupo-Moting from the left scored one and assisted another while dominating the attack, if he managed to miss out though, I expect to at least see Allen sneak in!
Messi
All time top goal scorer, breaking Muller’s record, in an El Classico, where his performance was near perfect. Is there any justice on this world? Find out Wednesday!
Aguero 
Manchester City appears to be an unstoppable force this year and after another win at home to Bournemouth, they enter the Christmas period unbeaten. In a dominant 4-0 victory it was Aguero who really stood out, scoring twice and assisting another.
Kane 
Tottenham were away to Burnley on Saturday and after they received an early penalty, everyone knew this was going to be Kanes’s day to shine! Scoring once from the spot and twice more later in the game, Tottenham won 3-0 and Kane secured his hat-trick.
 
Substitutes
Herrerin 
Athletic Bilbao travelled to Real Betis for their weekend fixture and in a fairly even game, they just managed to edge the win. In a 2-0 victory, one man really kept them ahead. With 16 shots against him and 6 great saves, Herrerin makes his way into these predictions.
Destro 
Bologna were on the road this weekend as they travelled to Chievo. In an extremely tight match, the away team managed to edge out a 3-2 victory, with Destro himself scoring twice.
Cala 
Getafe were hosts to Las Palmas for their midweek La Liga fixture and it was the home side who took all the points. In a comfortable 2-0 victory, Cala at CB not only ensured a clean sheet was kept, but also scored one of the goals.
Gural 
Antalyaspor were hosts to Alanyaspor for their Super Lig fixture on the weekend and once again, it was the home team who stole the show. In a confident 3-1 victory, it was their RM Gural who dominated the match and also found the back of the net twice.
Barak 
Back over to the Serie A now where Udinese were hosts to Verona. I’m a dominating 4-0 performance, Udinese took all 3 points with Barak from the midfield not only controlling the match, but also scoring twice.
Inui 
Eibar were hosts to Girona in their midweek La Liga clash and in this 5 goal thriller, there was only one possible winner. The hosts picked up a comfortable 4-1 victory with Inui on the left scoring half of them!
Grigg 
Will Grigg’s on fire, Oxford’s defence is terrified! Need I say anymore?
Jorgensen 
Feyenoord were hosts to Roda yesterday and in a 5-1 thrashing, we were never going to be short on possible selections. With 2 goals from one winger and 3 assists from the other, it instantly becomes hard to emit them from the lineups. Jorgensen however did his absolute best to ensure he stole this spot, scoring twice and assisting a third.
Thy 
Christmas Eve brought us very few games this year but this doesn’t mean they lacked quality! Over in the Eredivisie VVV-Venlo were hosts to Heracles in a 4 goal thriller. It was the hosts who secured the points in a 3-1 victory with their striker, Thy, scoring each and every one of their goals.
Bobo 
We head over to Australia next where Sydney FC were away to Wellington Phoenix. The game provided fans with a total of 5 goals, 4 of which fell to the visitors and 3 of those fell to Bobo. Surely a hat-trick will see him upgraded this week?
Johnsen 
ADO Den Haag were hosts to PEC Zwolle in their fixture last week and yet again it was the home team who stole the show. In a dominating 4-0 win, goals were split evenly between Falkenburg on the left and Johnsen up top. This spot could really go either way!
Nugent 
Heading back to England now where we find Derby play hosts to Millwall in the Championship. A dominant performance saw the home side take the points in a 3-0 win, with Nugent scoring twice and assisting the third."
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,15-Apr-18 08:21,"To start off with, we will go down the common route and look at domestic, non-cup matches. Keep in mind that as cups progress, the likelihood of them being included increases!
 
FC Nantes vs Stade Rennais
First up we head over to France, where Nantes and Stade Rennais go head to head in a battle towards the middle of the table. Now this may seem like a fairly unimportant game, however the historic rivalry between the clubs sends it straight into our shortlist. The game goes by the name of the “Derby De la Bretagne” or Derby Breton. Investing here should be done for discard and you should have no problems buying golds.
 
Dortmund vs Leverkusen
Over to Germany next where we see two sides desperately fighting to secure their spot within the Champions League places. With Leverkusen in fourth and Dortmund currently fifth, a loss here could see them slip down the table and a big performance from both sides is to be expected. Investments are simple, gold with a solid rating.
 
Atlas vs Guadalajara
Next up we have a derby between the Mexican sides Atlas and Guadalajara. The fixture is known as “El Clasico Tapatio” and according to Wikipedia is the oldest Mexican derby on record. With Guadalajara also receiving a mention for a Cup game this week, they become a double investment for the price of one, making this one of my favourite selections.
 
Standard Liege vs Anderlecht
Standard Liege and Anderlecht is or next pick, as they go head to head in the Pro League play-offs. There is no derby or heated rivalry with the clubs, however the fact that they are two of the larger clubs in the league brings my attention to this fixture. Investing in gold players shouldn’t be an issue, just be careful of prices.
 
Zulte Waregem vs Kortrijk
Now if the above playoff doesn’t tickle your fancy, then let’s take a look at one in the bottom half. Not only does this match hold importance in regards of the result, but the rivalry between these two sides adds to the significance and gives us yet another reason to possibly invest.
 
Salt Lake vs Colorado
Over to America next where we find Real Salt Lake and Colorado Rapids going head to head in a battle for the Rocky Mountain Cup. The Cup is given to the side with the most points (on a head to head basis) at the end of the season. Investments here are unlikely to be gold, silver players for discard are perfect, but if the market dries up there is no harm in picking up some bronzes.
 
Gamba Osaka vs Cerezo Osaka
Japan is our final stop with this week’s predictions, where we find Gamba Osaka and Cerezo Osaka go head to head in a derby known as, and you may have already guessed it, the Osaka Derby. Investments here are fairly simple, you will struggle to find a gold player, hence aim for discard value bronze and silver’s to reduce any risk.
 
Now while EA usually avoid cup matches, we have some big games on the cards! I would seriously consider the possibility of these being included this time around!
Man United vs Tottenham (FA Cup Semi-Final)
Chelsea vs Southampton (FA Cup Semi-Final)
Galatasaray vs Akhisar (Turkish Cup Semi-Final)
Fenerbahce vs Besiktas (Semi-Final)
Sporting vs Porto (Taca de Portugal Semi-Final)
Avangard Kursk vs Shinnik (Russian Cup Semi-Final)
Spartak Moscow vs Tosno (Russian Cup Semi-Final)
Schalke vs Eintracht (DFB-Polka Semi-Final)
AZ Alkmaar vs Feyenoord (KNVB Cup Final)
Toronto FC vs Guadalajara (CONCACAF Champions League Final)"
Black Friday,14-Nov-17 06:42,"What Is Black Friday 
Black Friday is an event that started in America to signify the beginning of the Christmas shopping period. The event takes place the day after Thanksgiving (which falls on the fourth Thursday of November), which leaves Black Friday starting on Friday the 24th of November this year.  
 
Retailers have commonly opened up extremely early and offered large discounts and promotions across a variety of products for those there early enough and due to the success, an additional event called Cyber Monday has come into existence (which falls on the following Monday) which sees online retailers do the same.  
 
Effectively, Black Friday consists of around a week of huge deals, offers, promotions and craziness, and yes, it does carry over to the FIFA franchise. 
 
What Does EA Offer During Black Friday
In the past, EA have jumped on board the Black Friday and Cyber Monday hype train, however they have done this in typical EA fashion. Instead of offering discounts or promotions that give the player base a real offer, they have simply used the events as a cash cow and released a variety of premium packs which come with their full price tag attached.  
 
In previous years we have seen a wide variety of pack offers added to each and every account alongside numerous ""lightning rounds"" (EA release a set quantity of packs to the market that operate on a first come first served basis). These packs commonly vary from 25k packs all the way up to 125k packs with quantities of anywhere up to 100,000 at any given time.
  
Why Does This Affect the FUT Market
As we have seen during the first two months of FIFA 18, prices have been on a gradual decline since the official release. The logic behind this is simple, as more and more players obtain packs (through FIFA points, SBC's, Weekend League and Squad Battles), larger quantities of premium players enter the market and supply begins to outweigh demand. 
 
As you can imagine, when millions of premium, top tier packs suddenly enter the market all at the same time, players begin undercutting one another which temporarily drives prices down. On top of this we have the simple fact that there is suddenly an overwhelming supply for the majority of these players, a supply that will in most circumstances outweigh the current demand and as we all know, when supply outweighs demand, undercutting takes place as everybody wants their cards to sell and ultimately, we see a price crash. 

How The Market Reacts To Black Friday
Way back when EA first promoted these events, people were caught off guard. Nobody had any experience dealing with this influx in cards, nobody had prepared for possible outcomes but mainly, nobody had any idea EA were going to release such an event. As the years started to pass, more and more people began working out the implications on the market and hence started to predict what was likely to happen. Most of the times these predictions would ring true and price drops would happen almost exactly as and when expected. The current market however, well that’s a whole different story. 
 
As mentioned above, as the years passed by, more and more individuals were correctly predicting/working out how the market was likely to react. As expected, those individuals started growing a following and more and more people became informed as to how the market was likely to react. If we jump to the here and now, we have thousands of investors predicting the market, who have hundreds of thousands of followers taking this advice as fact and to top it all off, we also have big names in the FIFA entertainment industry creating content around the expected drop in market prices. 
 
In theory this is all fantastic, as everybody saves coins by avoiding the crash. In reality, it is impossible for everyone to avoid the crash and this is why we saw the market drop before Black Friday last year, and then steadily recover. This pattern seems to have repeated this year, we have even had people planning ahead and avoid spending coins from release, simply due to fear of Black Friday and if we take a quick look at the market, a small observation of price drops over the past few weeks, we can see how concerned people have become.
 
Why The Market Rebounds And Recovers 
Remember all of those people who sold up months ago so they were ready for the crash? All those people who sold up weeks ago? Days ago? Even those that only sold the day before Black Friday? Well each and every one of these players didn't sell in order to store their coins in a long term, high interest bank account, they all sold up so that they could take advantage of the cheaper prices during the crash. What some of them didn’t take into account, is the volume of other players with the exact same mindset, and when a crowd of people plan on buying simultaneously, well this is when we see the heavy demand begin to outweigh supply. 
 
Now to say the market greatly recovers and rebounds across all players would be a lie, for some this influx of additional cards is simply too much and prices will remain lower. In this category we are looking at the lower rated premium players (84 and lower), the type that are in sufficient demand, are low rated enough that they are constantly packed, but are also too valuable to consider using within an SBC. The supply here can only continue to increase, and as players slowly collect and gather more coins, these types of cards will be the first names on the upgrade lists. Nobody talks about their Ultimate Dream Team and includes the cheap beasts. 
 
We then get into the top-tier players, the players that carry a premium price tag, the type of card that people were waiting until Black Friday to buy. As the FIFA cycle progresses throughout the year, more and more players obtain more and more coins, which directly leads to higher demand for these premium named players. We then need to consider the volume of people who were holding out and waiting to buy these players during the crash, as not only does this increase demand, but it also decreases supply, especially if they buy during the lower dips of the market. After we have taken all of this into consideration we come to a simple conclusion, yes there are a lot more of these cards on the market, but we also suddenly have a whole load more demand which is reducing the price crashes power. 
 
Finally, we look at special cards, ranging from previous informs all the way to icons. Icons are a fairly easy one to discuss first. Due to the Prime Icon SBC's released by EA, they will always hold some sort of value (especially in certain positions), they are premium, end-game cards which will ensure demand is always flowing (especially for the larger names and the prime versions of any) and to top this all off, they are simply new and exciting cards that a lot of people would love to simply try out. Informs and other special cards however, follow a whole different system, based off one simple fact. They are no longer obtainable through packs. Black Friday doesn't add to the supply for these cards, the supply remains consistent, the only variable here is demand. This creates a simple ripple effect throughout the market, players who are one of the best in their position for a set league or nation commonly rise, big names, overpowered cards, we have suddenly entered a buyer's market after the crash and a lot of these cards find themselves on a lot of shopping lists. 
 
When Should We Consider Buying Certain Players 
This is a question that has no specific answer, if only there was an exact date and time when cards would be at rock bottom! In reality it requires constant monitoring of the market. Prices have been consistently crashing for the past few weeks now and the time to buy is obviously when they are about to start their journey back up. It's like a race, you want to be the first away, the fastest, but if you jump in a second too early you receive a false start, while if you're a second too late you’ve already lost a load of ground. Effectively, you want to be the first of many to start buying their team and predicting the crash is at its lowest point. Last year this moment was a week or so before Black Friday, years back it was after Black Friday, the only question that remains is, when will be the optimum time this year."
Trading Before Release (Long Term),22-Sep-17 16:57,"We have spoken about trading methods and techniques that return an almost instantaneous profit, but what about things on a slightly longer term basis? How can we prepare for the global release of the game? What events are coming up where we can start to prepare for? This guide takes a look at exactly this!

Prices Now vs Prices Upon Release
If you follow the trading scene, you will see numerous comments mentioning how the prices during early access don't reflect the prices upon release. Commonly this insight is completely correct, but why?
Firstly we need to take into account the number of coins available on the market. While Xbox users have the use of 10 hours gameplay, PlayStation are stuck with just the web app and hence generating coins via the normal routes (matches, ea catalogue etc) becomes impossible. If we ignore the 10 hours Xbox users get, we are left with a player base who are able to open loyalty packs, complete the few SBC's there are and then jump onto the market and trade. The issue here is that everybody is attempting this, and with no additional coins entering the market it can become stale very quickly.
Now because of the lack of coins initially on the market, most players simply cannot afford the premium players, the bigger names and even if they could, they can't use them yet so what's the rush? This in turn forces prices to remain fairly low as people simply cannot afford these cards if they were valued at their true price.
Upon release, we immediately see an influx of FIFA points added, packs opened, games played and ultimately coins entering the market. This change is what allows prices to rise as more and more people can suddenly start affording these players. Like everything it comes back to supply and demand, the supply massively increases and as coins are earned, the demand instantly matches it.

Upcoming Events
Remember how in FIFA 17 we would see everyone talking about marquee matchups and the player of the month? Conversations and videos around how we could best prepare and invest were popping up by the minute, this was the most common and regular forms of investment for the casual FIFA player. So what's happened now? We have access to the web app yet nobody is mentioning this staple routes of investment, but they should be!
Last year marquee matchups was commonly released at the end of the week, a Thursday or occasionally Friday. Even in these early stages of FIFA we need to keep this in mind, while it's unlikely we see anything quite so early, the availability of gold cards for discard value is in abundance, providing us with a completely risk free investment.
Now let's say that the weekend passes, nothing is released and our investments fail, we could simply discard / re-list these cards and prepare again for the following week. It's a method that requires a small amount of research and next to no risk, it's also a method that absolutely anyone can use with any level of investment.
Maybe marquee matchups doesn't excite you enough, maybe you need something a a little more juicy to sink your hard earned coins into. Luckily there is another SBC, one we saw repeat through the course of last year, the POTM (player of the month), from the Premier League. 
Firstly let's evaluate the downsides here. Well we can't be sure of the requirements, the rating of cards needed or the release date, small hurdles for us to overcome really. Now the upside, and it's a big one, we already know who won the August POTM award, and it's somebody who will be in more than adequate demand. Look back to last year, what were the early challenges like? What can we expect to see from EA based on the amount of coins and cards available on the market? Which investments cover more than one possible route? Answering these questions could provide a risk free and potentially highly possible investment.
Remember that there is no guarantee these will repeat. While likely, minimising risk through smart investments should always be a priority.

League SBC's
Another fantastic feature introduced to ultimate team last year. League SBC's consisted of a challenge for every team within the league. Completing each one would provide a pack or coins for your effort, while completing the lot gave a premium card of the top scorer from that league. Luckily we see it return again for FIFA 18, the only difference seems to be that it's based on assists this time.

Now we all have access to the web app and therefore we can all access these challenges, but how many of us have? Did you realise these were available again? Did you look at the rewards? Did you consider completing or investing in them? Did you check market prices to see how much it would cost or where you could invest?
While these questions are directed towards the league challenges available, they apply to every event, or possible investment you consider. Research is always the key to ensuring profit, but the depth of this research is commonly what differs between players.
Did you break down the cost of the SBC? Did you break down the cost of individual challenges to see which could guarantee profit? Did you invest in the league? If so, did you research which players hold the most potential? Which teams have a single player available for one position? Which teams are made up of rare silver players? Which player prices have already began rising?
We need to be doing two things here. Thinking of questions, and then answering them. We are effectively trying to find a reason why our investment could fail, when we can't, we know it's a strong one.

Consumables
We all have access to the web app, we can all start building our teams, completing challenges but what we can't do (except some Xbox users) is actually play the game. With no matches being played, the demand for items such as fitness cards or contracts is at an all time low, what's the point in picking them up if we can't use them right? Well there will come a time when everybody is able to play, hence there will come a time when cards such as these are suddenly in demand.
Supply and demand rules once more, packs are still being opened, consumables are still entering the market, and players still need these cards. It's a strange situation, the demand is still present and in full force for these cards, we need them, however it's delayed for a week, until the global release. Do we believe these prices are too low? When will they or have they reached their rock bottom value? What do we expect them to rise to when demand kicks in? Once again, these questions could potentially make for some strong investments.

TOTW 1
We see this each and every year. TOTW 1 drops when players have web access and disappears before they are able to stock up on FIFA points and crack open those packs. This creates a distinct lack of these cards available on the market and if we see even the smallest of demand, prices can begin to rise.
The key here is determining if the player is a good investment because they hold a great card that will be in demand or if they are a good investment simply because they are cheap and in TOTW 1. If the answer falls into the category of the latter, perhaps this investment isn't the one we should be making."
MARQUEE MATCHUPS,02-Dec-17 17:01,"Manchester United vs Manchester City
First up today we have a massive match fr the Premier League. Current leaders Manchester City travel to local rivals Manchester United in a game that could see them extend their already significant lead. Investing here is simple, gold players, highest rating possible.
 
Liverpool vs Everton
For the second choice this week we stay within the confinement’s of the Premier League where Liverpool host the struggling Everton in the first Merseyside Derby of the season. If the Manchester Derby is included then obviously this will be left out and vice verse, but investments are once again gold players.
 
Monchengladbach vs Schalke
Moving over to the Bundesliga got this fixture and while it’s not a derby by name, there is everything to play for. With both teams sitting in the top 4, European football has to be the aim and hence every point counts. If investing here we have plenty of gold options so price is key.
 
Ajax vs PSV
Over to the Eredivisie now where second place Ajax play host to first place PSV. Now while this match has significant importance due to league standings, it also has historical relevance with the derby between the two clubs known as De Topper. Again, gold investments are plentiful so just be smart.
 
Spartak Moscow vs CSKA Moscow
According to Wikipedia once more, this match between the two Moscow sides goes by the name of The Main Moscow Derby. While this fixture has history, it also carries significance importance within the current league standings. With CSKA in third and Spartak in fourth, there is everything to play for! Once more, we have a wide supply of gold cards available for investment choices.
 
Western Sydney Wanderers vs Sydney FC
Over to Australia for this pick and we find ourselves with another local derby, this time featuring in Sydney. According to Wikipedia, these teams met for the first time in 2012 and is already one of the biggest matches in the A League. Investments here are slightly trickier, with discard silver players being ideal and bronze players being a great second choice if needed.
 
PAOK vs Panathinaikos
The rivalry between these two clubs comes from them being the two most popular teams, in two of the biggest cities in Greece, Athens and Thessaloniki. Investments here are mixed, while there are quite a few gold players to choose from, if prices start to inflate, don’t be afraid of a silver or two at discard.
 
Willem II vs NAC Breda
Our final pick sees us head back to the Eredivisie where we find Willem II face NAC Breda in a derby known as the Brabantse Derby. Once again, don’t expect both games from this league to feature, but if this is your choice, silver players may be the ideal investment for discard if possible."
REVIEW - The WorldCup Chimera,04-Jun-18 07:39,"The World Cup Mode is here, the hype is real, the pack weight is fantastic, the FUT market is destroyed, and we are all going insane.  In terms of reviews I was torn on how I wanted to write them during the World Cup Mode.  FUT Managers cannot simply go and purchase the players I review if they like what they hear.  With that in mind I have decided that each World Cup Mode review will contain a brief overview of three different players in hopes that FUT Managers can benefit from my experiences.  These ratings will be based on player levels in the World Cup Mode and not compared to the end game players that exist in FUT.  
My initial fear was that I would struggle to get players worth reviewing as I was not interested in spending many coins…. then I opened my starter pack, spent 50k coins, opened my ICON pack, and a monster was born.  My starter pack contained Thiago (a player I have never used in FUT before) and I was immediately disappointed considering all of the Messi, Neymar, and Ronaldo pulls I was reading about, but I was hoping there were better things to come.  After some uninspiring pulls I completed the ICON SBC and all was forgiven as Lothar Matthäus joined the squad.  I started putting together a hybrid of my best pulls and soon realized that I would have to start with a European squad and a 4-1-4-1 formation was the only way to make them fit.  I threw Renato Sanches into the mix as an afterthought and a throwback to FIFA 17; my squad was complete:

 
As I said before this team was amazing for me and I can’t get over how lucky the mixture of players I pulled were.  I was not exaggerating that a monster was born with this squad; and that monster was in my midfield.  In Greek Mythology there is a creature called a Chimera: A lion like creature, with the head of a goat emerging from the back, and a king cobra for a tail.  The fact that this creature is sometimes considered female is even more scary (don’t tell my wife I said this).


 
Thiago Alcántara: The King Cobra
RATING: 4/5
Starting with the tail; Thiago lined up in the defensive CM position of the 4-1-4-1 and for some unknown reason I didn’t change the formation in game; in fact I didn’t change the player instructions or player positions either, I just played.  Thiago just patrolled the pocket in front of my backline and disrupted everything my opponent could throw at me.  His stats don’t suggest a defensive juggernaut, but time and time again he was intercepting passes and starting me the other way on the counter attack.  His pace would normally be an issue, but in this case everything was in front of him and he always had just enough quickness to strike down attacks.  When he breaks up play his amazing dribbling stats allow him to slither his way through opponents and get the ball forward.  His passing is insane and I can imagine he could be a threat in a more advanced CM position as well.  I did manage a few long shots that he can hit with some real venom, but for the most part he remained further back.  Really impressed with this card and for any FUT managers discouraged by packing him, he is worth a go.
 
Lothar Matthäus: The GOAT
RATING 4.8/5
The title speaks for itself; Matthäus is another player that I have not had the pleasure of using in past versions of FUT, and if he is anything like he is in World Cup Mode, then I have obviously been missing out.  He absolutely melted my opponents in the midfield and was the link to my striker in every game.  I know that I would have been changing my formation immediately if it was not for Matthäus and without him I would not have had the success I have enjoyed so far.  He runs, and runs, and runs at a pace that other midfielders cannot cope with, especially later in the match.  You only have to look at his stats to know that this card is a game changer; all 80/90+ BASE STATS and a 4 STAR WEAK FOOT make Matthäus the complete package.  There may be better attacking options in the midfield positions for World Cup Mode, but as an all-around beast this guy is the GOAT.
 
Renato Sanches: The Lion
RATING 4.3/5
No, I haven’t lost my mind with this rating, and no I don’t have 100 Renato Sanches’ in my trade pile waiting to sell J. Without Renato Sanches this monster would not have been complete.  You have Matthäus destroying opponents left and right, Thiago poisoning would be attacks, and then you have Sanches and his beautiful mane ripping opponents to shreds.  Time and time again during the Online Tournament I would need a timely goal, a last second tackle, a block in the box, or someone to take control of the game; time and time again that person was Renato Sanches.  He is back baby (like FIFA 17 back I swear).  Granted, I used him at the start of FIFA 18 when I was scraping for coins and he was good then, just not Bakayoko good.  However, with the style of this World Cup Mode it is like he was made for this gameplay and vice versa.  If you have a European squad, and you scroll through and this guy is sitting in your club, you have to try him.  Beyond his 4 STAR WEAK FOOT there is nothing about his stats that screams game changer and in fact his stats probably suggest the opposite.  But I stand by my rating and if you watch my video you will see him delivering once again in the World Cup Final, in injury time, to bring me to the ultimate glory. This lion does not sleep!
Cheers for reading.
 
Game Stats:

 

 


Game Highlights:"
Review - Prime Maldini,28-Mar-18 06:21,"Defenders in Football are like artwork; you don’t fully appreciate them until you get up close and take a look at the craft, technique, and precision it takes to be a masterpiece.  This neglectful mentality has transferred over to the majority of FUT Mangers and I am no exception.  If I have 500k to spend on one attacker and defender combination, you can guarantee that 90% of the budget will end up in the attacking position.  That doesn’t mean I won’t be complaining when my 50k defender makes mistakes, which is poor managing on my end.  With this in mind I jumped at the chance to review PRIME ICON Paolo Maldini.  I have been putting off spending significant coins on my backline as Xmas VVD enters game 600 and it is about time I looked at a real game changer in defensive positions.  
Maldini gained the nickname Il Capitano throughout his long playing career at Milan and for Italy.  With this in mind it made sense to immediately give him the arm band for my remaining Weekend League games.  I decided to give four chemistry styles a three game tryout and would eventually settle on the best option for the final eight games.  BASIC, BACKBONE, SENTINEL, and ANCHOR were all used to see which attribute combination would provide the best results.  This review will contain a brief look at Maldini’s base stats, a summary of the best chemistry style used, and a breakdown of some numbers from his 20 game loan.  Maldini was the General in the following squad:


 
PACE
There is only one other useable defender with the same level of pace as Maldini and that is TOTY Ramos.  Pace immediately sets Maldini apart from many other CB options and also means that SHADOW does not have to be relied upon.  Throughout the weekend I witnessed Maldini deal with speedsters such as Lozano and Alessandrini with minimal issue.  If your opponent’s go-to attack is sending the ball down the channels and winning a foot race, Maldini has you covered.
RATING: 5/5
 
SHOOTING
The only shots I took with Maldini this weekend came from the ball falling to him after corner kicks.  I would say this occurred roughly ten times.  In all ten occasions a lucky fan in the upper stand went home with a souvenir.  Like a helium filled balloon the ball simply floats away into the atmosphere never to be seen again.  I started laying the ball off near the end of the weekend, even on clear cut shooting chances.  The base stat suggests that his shooting is 56 and even that seems high.  
RATING: 0.5/5 
 
PASSING
At the beginning of the year I joined the hordes of FUT Managers using Bailly in their backlines.  He is definitely a beast and for the price tag you cannot go wrong.  However, my biggest issue with Bailly was his passing.  The man couldn’t pass the butter if he was sitting right beside you at the dinner table.  Maldini was the polar opposite in this regard and was capable of spraying passes around the pitch.  The 4 STAR WEAK FOOT contributes to this stat as he can thread the ball with either foot into your midfielders and strikers. 
RATING: 5/5
 
DEFENDING
If you look up lists of the Top Ten Defenders of All Time you will find Maldini lurking near the top of most lists.  He is the epitome of an ICON and EA treated him appropriately with his defending stats.  He is strong enough to push players of the ball, intelligent enough to break up play, and capable of making the necessary tackles needed.  One odd observation was that throughout the weekend he would switch positions with Ramos at random.  I have never experienced CBs trade places this often.  Regardless of the side he patrolled he was a pillar of my defensive foundation all weekend.
RATING: 5/5
 
DRIBBLING
Immediately, I was pleasantly surprised with Maldini’s dribbling in the back.  Turns away from forwards were made simple with tight touches and Maldini simply ghosted away from them.  He is silky on the ball and gave me confidence that I do not feel with other defenders.  Three or four times he did get caught on the ball, which may be due to lag, my previously mentioned confidence, or that his dribbling stats were showing through at times.
RATING: 4/5
 
PHYSICAL
I could sit here and rave about Maldini’s physical stats and I would not be overstating how good this card is.  But, and this is a huge butt, like Kim Kardashian huge; I could not win a header with this card.  In retrospect I might have made a mistake and if I could have my time back I would have tried FINISHER on Maldini for 3-4 matches.  It is the only chem boost that would take Maldini into 99 HEADING and maybe could have helped.  As previously stated I was keeping stats all weekend and the heading summary for Maldini was not good reading.  Disappointing to say the least and was a constant frustration for the 20 game trial.
RATING:  4/5
 
CHEMISTRY STYLE
ANCHOR was by far the best option I tried.  The boost to the aforementioned HEADING saw minimal improvement; all DEFENDING stats move to 99 RATED and he moves into the “this is ridiculous for a defender” levels of PACE.  Again, a little disappointed with myself that I did not give FINISHER a go.
 
FINAL SCORE
RATING: 4.7/5
When I previewed Maldini’s stats and read small reviews from other FUT Managers I was expecting the God that this man was in his prime.  In the end I received something close, but not to the full extent I had hoped.  He is excellent, but not the all-around monster I had anticipated.  Some of the numbers speak for themselves:
1,750.000 – the amount of coins Maldini’s SBC will cost you. 
98 – percent passing percentage for Maldini this weekend.
96 – Maldini’s rating as a CB with Anchor applied
74 – the amount of headers I lost with Maldini this weekend, seriously, it was awful.
25 – wins this weekend and Maldini played a large part in 14.
8 – clean sheets, some rage quits, but they all count.
3 – games where I was destroyed using Maldini, they were simply better than me.
1 – header off the cross bar from a corner, really wanted that for my video.
0 – chances that I will be completing this SBC.  He did not out perform Xmas VVD by a big enough margin to justify the coins.  For other FUT Mangers I can see him being a real game changer.  But for me, he just wasn’t the complete player I was hoping for. 

Cheers for reading!

 
Game Highlights:"
Serie A TOTS Predictions,19-May-18 09:25,"Starting Eleven
Handanovic
Our first selection for Serie A, is one that may raise a few discussions. Handanovic has had yet another solid season for Inter, and single handedly won them points along the way. The key concern is Buffon, despite his lack of game time, he has still been consistent and with it being his final season, we may see him creep in above Handanovic here.
Kolarov 
Onto our first defender now, and what a sensational season Kolarov has had. Moving to a new League is always a risk, however he has proven that age and experience trumps everything, as he contributed to a semi-final Champions League run and solid league finish. Roma only conceded 28 goals all season, and while this stat is impressive enough alone, the 2 goals, 8 assists and 6 man of the match awards secures his spot in our lineup.
Chiellini 
The title race this year was incredibly tight, but a few moments of weakness towards the end from Napoli, saw Juventus wrap things up with a game to spare. While their goal scoring record was sensational at 84, their defensive one was equally as impressive, with just 23 against them. Chiellini has already featured in the community vote, but I fully expect to see him here as well.
Benatia 
Next up we move across to Chiellini’s defensive partner, Benatia. Together they have been one hell of a force, and after such a successful campaign, I wouldn’t be surprised if both made the final cut. On top of the solid defensive showing, Benatia also has a couple of goals to his name and proves his danger from set pieces.
Sandro 
Picking fullbacks was extremely tough this time around, and while many may say Sandro fell below expectations, when we look at the success Juventus achieved and Sandro’s attacking stats, I feel like EA will make this happen. We have mentioned the defensive stats, but with 4 goals, 4 assists and 3 man of the match awards, Sandro shows that he is the complete package.
Pjanic
It’s starting to feel like we are simply listing the entire Juventus lineup here, but fear not, other teams will feature....at some point. Now while Pjanic may not have incredible numbers in regards to goals and assists, time after time he has proven just how valuable he is to Juventus, and was a fundamental part of their title push. Defensively great and with 4 goals and 8 assists, he makes it into these predictions.
Dybala 
Ok, this is the final Juventus player to feature within the starting eleven, I promise! Truth be told though, if we had to end on a Juventus player, there hasn’t been one with a more successful season. Dybala continues to prove his ability, improving game on game, year after year. Prolific across several positions, he showed how adapt he was as a centre forward, striker, left winger and right winger too. With 22 goals, 5 assists and 8 man of the match awards, this man is nailed on.
Perisic 
Over to Inter Milan now, and while they currently sit just outside of the Champions League spots, with one game to go, they could still sneak in. A few players have really stood out for Inter this year, Perisic being one of them. Having contributed to around a third of the goals, with 11 goals and 9 assists, surely he makes the final line-up.
Insigne 
Finally! It may have taken 8 Players, but we finally reach someone from Napoli. What a season they have had, pushing Juventus every step of the way and coming so close to stealing the title from them. Insigne was a fundamental part of this success, showing his ability to disturb an oppositions defensive structure and with 8 goals, 9 assists and 6 man of the match awards, this guy feels like a lock.
Icardi 
Game after game, week after week, year after year, we talk about Icardi and how he is constantly improving. This year has been no exception, and out of Inter Milan’s 69 goals, he has scored 28 of them. Despite his success, he currently sits one goal behind, in the race for the golden boot, but with 1 game remaining, anything could happen!
Immobile
So here we are, the final selection for this starting eleven, and with it, we find the current top scorer in the league. Immobile has been absolutely sensational this season, scoring 29, assisting a further 9 and wrapping up 7 man of the match awards along the way. The final match of the season is a big one, with the team needing the points and Immobile wanting to secure the golden boot.
 
Substitutes
Alisson 
Onto the bench now, and our first selection is a familiar face. It comes as no surprise that this Brazilian goalkeeper is attracting attention from across the world. Fantastic for Roma, currently keeping Ederson out the Brazilian National Team, and having already featured in the community team of the season, I fully expect to see him again here.
Skriniar 
Now with Inter Milan currently sitting in fifth, outside Champions League spots and needing a slip up from Lazio to change their fortunes, it may feel strange to see so many of their players featuring within these predictions. However, with just 28 goals conceded , it shows just how solid they have been across the back. Skriniar has played a key part in this, and with 4 goals to his name as well, he shows his importance across the entire pitch.
Koulibaly 
Onto our final defensive selection now, where we find a man who has (mostly), been absolutely brilliant for Napoli this season. With just 28 goals conceded, Napoli have the joint second best record in the league, and when we then consider the 5 goals, 1 assist and 4 man of the match awards, Koulibaly suddenly becomes a very strong candidate here.
Allan
From a critical part of Napoli’s back line, straight into the heart of their midfield now. Allan has had an incredible season for Napoli, and while there are several players with similar stats that could take this spot, Allan is our man of choice. Covering crazy amounts of the pitch each game, solid defensively, and with 4 goals and 5 assists, Allan makes our list.
Nainggolan 
From a slightly controversial selection, to one that could be considered just plain wrong. Now was Nainggolan one of the best midfielders across the season? No. Well was he particularly impressive, and consistent? Well not really. So why are we including him here? Well, the reality is that he was “good enough”, and based on previous team of the season line-ups, it appears that EA would rather include fan favourites / pack sellers, opposed to top performers.
Savic 
Wow. Words can not explain just how incredible this man has been, both in real life and for FUT players worldwide. An absolute animal on the pitch, both defensively and going forward. It’s no wonder that he is in high demand from clubs across the world, but for now, we should be guaranteed one final blue card, that features Savic in a Lazio kit.
Luis Alberto 
From one Lazio midfielder to another now, and while Alberto may commonly be regarded as a striker, he has shown his versatility this year in roles across the pitch. From Lazio’s 87 goals scored, Alberto has played a role in 25 of them. With 11 goals, 14 assists and 5 man of the match awards, this man deserves his team of the season boost.
Falque 
We haven’t really seen many players outside the top 5 clubs featuring so far, but one man that I believe truly deserves a spot, is Falque. Torino currently sit mid-table, and out of their 52 goals scored, Falque has played a part in around 30%. With 11 goals and 8 assists, I fully expect this man to feature, especially with the lack of wingers from elsewhere.
Costa 
This troubled winger has had a rough couple of years, for one reason or another, his time at other clubs have been far from successful, however Juventus have ensured they brought about change. With 17 starts and 13 appearances from the bench, Costa has been a critical part of this title win. With 4 goals, 12 assists and an above average match rating, we could be seeing Costa in blue!
Dzeko 
Onto our final three selections now, and with it we find three absolutely incredible strikers. First up is a man who has shown his worth across all competitions this season. With a solid Serie A campaign seeing Roma sit in third and an incredible Champions League run, seeing Roma reach the semi-finals, Dzeko has been incredible throughout. With 16 goals and 4 assists in the league, the raw numbers may not be as impressive as usual, however with the system EA use, it is most likely he has done enough.
Higuain 
Since his big money move a few years back, Higuain has been absolutely sensational for Juventus. The same could be said about his performances this year, even though he hasn’t been quite as clinical in front of goal. With 16 goals and 5 assists, it is likely he has done enough, and although I may be one of a select few, this is probably the team of the season card I want the most!
Mertens 
Our final selection here goes to this Belgium striker, the man who lead the line for Napoli during their title push this season. Mertens has been absolutely phenomenal since converting to a striker, and with 18 goals, 6 assists and 7 man of the match awards this season, this incredible form continues. Although Napoli can no longer win the league, surely a blue card on FUT for Mertens is the next best thing!

REVIEW - TOTS DOUGLAS COSTA,28-May-18 07:00,"Another week, another TOTS release, and this time FUT Managers were treated to a two for one special.  The Ligue 1 and the Serie A (that’s right I said it) TOTS players boast some serious firepower for sure.  They also boast some serious price tags and so I tried to review an affordable player with a considerable upside.  In the end I decided that TOTS Douglas Costa was the perfect mix of price and performance while offering easy links to hybrids as well.  I tested this card over 20 games of Weekend League in order to gain a sense of his abilities against the best squads and players in FUT.
I continued to roll with a 4-2-2-2 formation and I used Costa either as a LF/RT ST or the RIGHT CAM throughout the weekend.  In selecting a chemistry style I wanted to boost Costa’s 82 FINISHING, which is quite poor for an end game player.  However, after applying the SNIPER style Costa receives a +15 FINISHING BOOST moving him to 97 FINISHING, much better.  Costa was the cruise missile in the following squad (switched with Salah for 10 games at ST as well):

 
PACE
At 99 ACCELERATION and 94 SPRINT SPEED at only 5’6 you know you are getting a speed demon.  At this point in FUT there are so many players boasting these levels of speed.  However, I think all FUT Managers can agree that there are certain players who can truly pull away from opponents, and those that are just quick.  Costa was definitely in the first category and gave my opponents serious issues if they wanted to chase back controlling their midfielders.  Costa is like the Road Runner, just out of reach of the flailing Wile E. Coyote trying so hard to catch up, but always so far away.
RATING: 5/5
 
SHOOTING
Maybe it is the way I approach the ball when shooting, or the angle I hold the stick, or maybe even the camera angle?  But for me, left footed players in FUT are the best at opening up and curling the ball into the far corner.  Costa was no different and I scored quite a few goals in this manner and goalies just couldn’t cope.  The problem is that Costa’s 3 STAR WEAK FOOT feels more like a 1 star weak foot and intelligent defenders keep you onto his right foot, very similar to all of the versions of Salah.  Even more disappointing is Costa’s finishing, which did not feel like it was 97 rated during the weekend.  By my notes, Costa should have scored 6 more goals this weekend and that is only counting clear scoring chances.  Quite disappointing.
RATING: 3.5/5
 
DRIBBLING & PASSING
In a previous review I mentioned that players with pace always have a high pass completion rate for me.  They pull away from midfielders and move defenders, which ultimately opens up passing lanes.  I would 100% put Costa in this category and say that his pace pulls opponents defenders way out of position and this led to many of his assists this weekend.  It doesn’t hurt that Costa has ALL 90+ PASSING stats except for 86 LONG PASSING.  So you know that all of the passes are going where you want.  Furthermore, Costa’s dribbling is insane and with the SNIPER chem style applied he moves to a base stat of 99 DRIBBLING.  Costa looks like he has Velcro attached to his foot and the ball just follows him around.  He simply pulls it away from would be defenders and they Charlie Brown into the air and Costa skips on by.   The speed that he takes his touch out of the dribble is also amazing and took me a few matches to get used to, but after that it opened up shooting and passing lanes for me throughout the weekend.
PASSING RATING: 5/5
DRIBBLING RATING: 5/5
 
DEFENDING & PHYSICAL
While I don’t think FUT Managers would be purchasing Costa in hopes of a defensive powerhouse or a midfield juggernaut, I will still point out that Costa is definitely not either of these.  I have seen smaller midfielders with pace deployed in defensive positions with amazing success.  Raheem Sterling for instance is like a rabid squirrel hunting down opponents causing havoc all game long.  Costa is definitely not like this and has zero defensive qualities to add to your squad.  From the Physical standpoint it does appear that Costa has some hidden stats.  Players such as TOTS Alejandro Gomez show strength on the ball despite his 52 STRENGTH rating and Costa does the same at only 76 STRENGTH.  He feels significantly stronger on the ball which was a nice addition to the squad.  The final comment I would make is on the 90 STAMINA that Costa possess.  Around the 70th minute of every match I noted a significant drop off in Costa’s output.  He seemed slower, weaker, and could not keep up with other players in my squad.   This was a frustration in that I wasn’t using a sub to change the game and instead was wasting a sub because Costa was no longer effective.  Small complaint, but still worth noting.
DEFENDING RATING: 1.5/5
PHYSICAL RATING: 3.5/5
 
FINAL SCORE
RATING: 3.9/5
With the FUT Market continuing to dip as we approach the World Cup mode the value for coins conversation has changed.  As of this writing TOTS Douglas Costa is 310k on the XBOX market and by the time this review is released he could be into the 200k price mark.  At 200-230k I would say that this card is absolutely value for coins.  Opponents cannot handle the pace that Costa brings to the team and if you enjoy dribbling this card will bring you a great deal of joy.  On his left foot Costa can produce magic and if you enjoy these types of players you will be extremely satisfied.  However, at 300-330k you are getting the exact same qualities… and that is it.  In my opinion at this point in FUT it takes a very special card to be worth 300k+ and Costa does not tic enough boxes to reach these “very special” levels.
Cheers for Reading! 
 
Game Stats:

 
Game Highlights:"
RATINGS REFRESH - LA LIGA,28-Jan-18 11:11,"La Liga:
 
We move over to Spain for todays edition, where we look at La Liga and which big changes could potentially be just around the corner. Some of these proposed changes come as a bit of a surprise, while others seem obvious and long overdue

Casemiro +1 Upgrade
First up on our list is a rarity, as while Real Madrid have had an awful season so far, Casemiro has been a ray of sunshine in an otherwise lacklustre side. With a few goals and assists from a defensive midfielder role, the 25-year-old Brazilian shows it can be done from just anywhere on the pitch. Hopefully this positive attitude and determination will rub off on his teammates, providing a massive turn around in the second half of the season.

Ter Stegen +2 Upgrade

From a struggling Real Madrid, we move over to their fiercest rivals and league leaders Barcelona. A side that are seemingly on cruise control right now, miles ahead in the league and absolutely flying. Ter Stegen is a player who has played a huge part in this success, games have been won, points have been secured and most importantly people are starting to notice just what this German goalkeeper is capable of. A plus 2 upgrade seems like it would be spot on here.

Busquets +1 Upgrade
Staying with Barcelona for a couple more picks here, and surprisingly we are mainly focusing on their defensive players. While Busquets, Ter Stegen and Alba make our list, Roberto could also be due for a boost alongside the likes of their new attacking midfielder, Paulinho. Back to Busquets for now though, and just like with the goalkeeper, it shows the importance of building a team from the back. Busquets has managed to completely lock down the midfield, controlling the tempo and speed all season and hence a +1 upgrade is due.

Jordi Alba +2 Upgrade
We move onto our third and final Barcelona player to feature in this shortlist, and while we have spoken about just how solid they have been defensively, we haven’t  looked at the key numbers, so here we go. With 20 games played in the league, Barcelona have scored an incredible 57 goals but what’s even more impressive is the 9 goals conceded, less than 1 every two games. When we also add the fact that Alba has 1 goal and 6 assists already this season, it becomes clear just how important he has been both going forward and defensively. 

Saul +1 Upgrade
Next up we move across to second place Atletico Madrid where we find Saul, a central midfielder who has both a Path to Glory and Inform card already. The consistency shown across the midfield this season is the sole reason we could be seeing an upgrade, ever-reliable and always present, a +1 boost could be on the cards here.

Bakambu +1 Upgrade
After a sensational start to the season, Bakambu’s momentum seems to have slowed down as we approached the half way mark. With 9 goals from just 15 appearances however, it becomes clear that when Bakambu is on fire, he is near unstoppable, and the multiple special cards we saw added earlier in the cycle are proof of exactly this. Hopefully this 25-year-old from Congo will recapture his early season form in the tail end of the football season, either way he has truly deserved a small boost for now.

Bale -1 Downgrade
While we have seen plenty of exciting upgrades mentioned across these guides, it feels like the right time to mention a couple of the players who perhaps haven’t had such a fantastic season so far. First up is the Welsh winger, Gareth Bale. After his big money move to Spain, it always felt like Bale never quite hit the highs we all expected. Whether it was due to competition, injuries, or simply poor performances, we were always left waiting for that little bit extra.

Benzema -1 Downgrade
Every transfer window sees this French striker linked with a move away from Real Madrid, yet every window closes with him staying put. At 30 years old, it becomes clear that he isn’t the player he once was, which makes it even more understandable to know that Madrid are looking for replacements. With just 2 goals and 3 assists from 13 appearances in the league this year, it just isn’t good enough for such a prestigious side and hence the possible -1 downgrade comes into play.
 
Upgrades

 
 
Downgrades"
Investing With OTW,26-Sep-17 17:12,"With the global release of FIFA 18 just around the corner and the early access in full swing, the launch of the highly awaited OTW cards is just around the corner!
What exactly are OTW cards? How do they operate? Why should we care? 
Well OTW (one to watch) cards highlight some of the biggest fresh transfers from the previous window. These players receive a new special card that mimics the stats of the regular base card. During the course of the domestic season, if this player receives an inform, the OTW card immediately copies these new stats and automatically upgrades to match the highest inform available. Keep in mind that based off last years system, once the season is over this card will no longer upgrade and if a different special version is awarded, for example a man of the match card, once again the OTW will not changed.
 
Finding The Value
As mentioned above, OTW cards upgrade themselves in line with inform cards received by the player. When we initially consider buying this card over their regular one, we are buying for one reason alone, potential. While all of these cards are exciting and carry some level of potential, we need to keep in mind that some are more likely to receive upgrades than others and that some upgrades will in turn create a much bigger price increase than others. To demonstrate this we will look at some of the data from FIFA 17.

Player Positions
The first factor for us to consider here is how easy it is to obtain a TOTW card for each position. Historically a defender has needed a combination of a strong defensive performance (usually a clean sheet), an assist or a goal. A striker however is usually judged on a single variable, how many goals they scored.
The average team consists of 4/5 defenders against just 1/2 strikers, this is yet another factor that falls in the attackers favour. Alongside this, the general weighting of attackers vs defenders featuring in the TOTW usually favours the attackers. 

League & Club
The bigger the club, the more likely it is they will produce stronger results on a consistent basis. This is a fact and is proven by the likes of Juventus, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich time after time. This makes obtaining a special card all that much easier for players within such squads.
If you surround yourself with other superstars, you instantly increase the likelihood of a clean sheet, a solid midfield, the delivery (assists) and hence goals. The larger teams have a lot more favourable matchups over the course of the year which in turn should provide a stronger chance at an inform.

The Starting Eleven
A fairly simple one here, if a player isn't a regular starter then the chances of an inform are immediately cut. A clear example of this would be comparing Kante to Sanches from last year. 
Both players were in huge demand throughout the season and both played a defensive midfielder role. The key difference was Kante started almost every game while Sanches was lucky to come on as a substitute. The result reflected this with Kante receiving special cards and Sanches receiving nothing.

Initial Release
During this period the market is a frenzy. The game is still new, player prices have yet to stabilise and hence the majority of players struggle to estimate where a cards true value lies. This mayhem carries over with the release of OTW cards and can often provide dramatic price swings by the hour.

The goal here is to simply predict where these cards prices will settle. We don't need a price number, but we need to be able to comfortably believe that the card is either too expensive or too cheap before we buy or sell respectively.

Investment Cycle
With the normal NIF (non inform) cards on the market, prices follow a traditional pattern. They are highest during the first few weeks of the game and then gradually become cheaper as the cycle progresses. OTW cards also follow this pattern, however there is a whole rollercoaster of changes that take place along the way.
After the weekend match finishes, prices are usually at their lowest point. There is no hype, no immediate chance of an inform and hence no influx of investments. Players holding this card are usually using it opposed to investing.
As the week progresses and the next match day approaches, hype slowly starts to build again as people start picking up these cards in hope of a top performance. Investment is still possible here, but the profit margins are slightly lower.
During the build up to the match, last minute investments are made and prices begin to increase. Buying here is usually buying at an inflated price and hence a much riskier investment. At this stage you are all in hoping that a goal is scored or ultimately an inform is achieved, it is effectively a gamble.
After the match (provided nothing significant took place), we see prices begin to drop again and the rollercoaster returns to the start.

Investment Opportunities
While investing can be difficult, investing in OTW cards has become extremely simple due to the repeat pattern they follow. Before we entertain the idea of investing here, research is required. We need to know how much these cards are typically selling for (outside of match hype), what the supply quantity is like, what the demand quantity is like, if they are likely to start the next game and the reason for why we believe this is a good investment.
While prices increase on the build up to a game, they rapidly decrease towards the end. This is usually the optimal time to be buying these players, provided the price is right. As soon as we pull the trigger we need to already have a selling plan in place. Are they playing next week? What's my expected profit? When should I offload the card? Answering these questions makes for an extremely solid investment.
Alongside using the normal cycle, we also have the option of making reaction investments. If you are watching the match, Lukaku scores and you are instantly on the market buying him, there is a strong chance that you are able to buy before hype kicks in and then sell during it (or hold if you are feeling really lucky). This method provides more risk and requires your reactions to be lightning fast. Once again it is important to know the normal price to ensure you aren't buying an already inflated card.

How Hype Effects The Market
Hype provides a key role when making a decision around investments. Is a players price inflated because they are a new signing? Is it inflated because of a great performance? Is it inflated due to popular content creators and their love for a card rubbing off on viewers? All of these reasons can effect the price of a card, increasing its price on a short term basis and hence making any investment unreliable at best.
This hype carries over to OTW cards in the same manner as above, but is also aided with additional hype during real life matches. Whether it's simply being named in the starting lineup, scoring an early goal or simply looking solid in defence, people will begin investing in these cards as a match progresses. These additional investments will cause prices to temporarily rise causing a fake market price. Investing during this period becomes extremely risky, while selling becomes an investors paradise.
