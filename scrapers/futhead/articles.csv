Last week turned out to be as tough as expected with Liverpool bringing in one of the biggest surprises as they beat Manchester City, in what was always going to be a very close game.
Hopefully this week will turn out to be a little easier, with big games in the Netherlands, France and Italy possibly proving to be quite tough to predict. 
Let’s get into this weeks games.

Ajax v Feyenoord
Second host fifth in the Dutch game known as Der Klassieker between Ajax and Feyenoord. Both teams will be hoping for a win to set off the second half of the season like they ended the first - winning a good run of games.
Ajax sit five points behind league leaders PSV as the Eredivisie restarts after its month-long winter break. They will be hoping to keep tabs on the leaders, especially with both teams not facing off until April in the league, so dropping points now could prove extremely costly in the long run.
Feyenoord have started to recover from a poor start to the season which saw them gain just 19 points from their first 12 games. Since then, they have gone eight games unbeaten, winning seven of those in the process. 
Both sides went on good runs towards the end of last year, but it is Ajax that will come into the game with greater confidence, as they are on a five game unbeaten streak against their bitter rivals, including an embarrassing 4-1 away win in October. As this is the first game back after the winter break, it’s difficult to say how this one will turn out, but I believe that a home win is the most logical result due to past results and home advantage.
Game time: Sunday 21st, 1:30 p.m. (GMT) / 8:30 a.m. (EST)
My Prediction: Ajax win

Inter Milan v Roma
How times change in the space of a month. Both Inter Milan and Roma have seen a massive downturn in form since the start of December, managing to win just one game each from their previous six fixtures.
Three points from their previous five games, with losses against mid-table sides Udinese and Sassuolo, has seen Inter Milan drop from one point clear at the top of the league to nine points off the pace. Draws against Fiorentina and Lazio may have steadied them a bit recently, but they will be hoping to return to winning ways sooner rather than later to keep up any slight hope of a title race, never mind facing a battle for Champions League qualification.
Roma have been in slightly better form, winning one of their last five games and only losing two. With Dzeko having scored in the last two games, they will be hoping that he can kick on from there and help Roma to a much needed win to get them back in serious contention for a Champions League spot.
With both sides desperate for a win, the game should be a very open and attacking one. Past games have often varied, with four wins each and two draws in the past 10 encounters (the previous two have ended 3-1 to the away side both times), making it very difficult to predict how this one will finish.
Game time: Sunday 21st, 7:45 p.m. (GMT) / 2:45 p.m. (EST)
My Prediction: Draw

Real Betis v Barcelona
This should be a fairly easy game to predict.
Barcelona are the runaway league leaders and have dropped just six point all season - drawing against Celta Vigo, Valencia and Atletico Madrid. A shock midweek loss in the Copa del Rey quarter final first leg defeat to city rivals Espanyol may lead to them playing a slightly weakened side at the weekend in order for them to save some big players to try and get a win to see them through in the cup.
Real Betis surprised city rivals Sevilla by beating them 5-2 a couple of weeks ago, and have won three of their last four games. However, against a team like Barcelona I can’t see that run continuing.
This should be a fairly routine and comfortable win for the visitors, who should keep their unbeaten league record going for another week at least. Betis will be hoping that Barcelona do save some players, like Messi who played the full 90 minutes on Wednesday, to give them the best possible chance of victory in the second leg next week.
Game time: Sunday 21st, 7:45 p.m. (GMT) / 2:45 p.m. (EST)
My Prediction: Barcelona win

Lyon v PSG
Second hosts first in Ligue 1, in what a very interesting game. A win for Lyon would cut the gap to eight points, and potentially restart some sort of title race in France. A win for PSG would put any chance of a title race to bed, with their vastly superior goal difference and points tally.
What a week it was for PSG. After missing out on TOTY to Harry Kane, Neymar decided to show everyone why he should be included next year as he led PSG in their complete anihilation of Dijon on Wednesday, where he scored four and set up another two in their 8-0 victory.
Lyon have been in excellent form recently, with just one loss in their last 15 league games. They are not as in some recent years when they had the likes of Lacazette leading the line, but they are still showing that they are more than capable of challenging the other big teams in France for ‘the best of the rest’ spots behind PSG.
PSG have won the previous four games between these sides, and I expect that run to continue.
Game time: Sunday 21st, 8:00 p.m. (GMT) / 3:00 p.m. (EST)
My Prediction: PSG win

Lyon’s Dutch international Kenny Tete is the reward player this week, who will definitely come in useful in the future due to the amount of Dutch Icons that are available on Console and should be coming to Mobile at some point."

What is a “Starter Team”?
At this point in FIFA most of you should be familiar with this term, but on the other hand it has also been nine months. So for a refresher, a starter team is created at the early stages of FUT. It is the first side that you’ll create on your World Cup journey and often features lower rated players who have stats that leverage game mechanics (pace, strength, etc.) to take advantage of other lower rated items.
Methodology
We have divided each of our breakdowns into five sections. The first four are by position; attack (ST, CF, LW/LF, and RW/RF), midfield (CAM, CM, RM, LM and CDM), defense (CB, LB, and RB), and goalkeeper (GK). 
In each of these sections, we give a “Starter Squad Strength” rating out of 10. To arrive at this rating, we went through each nation position by position identifying players that could slot into starter squads, while also having ratings that make them likely to pack at the beginning of the game. 
We also gave upgradability rankings. “Upgradability” is our term for the potential to upgrade your starter squad with mid/upper tier players throughout the game. For example, France has an incredibly high midfield upgradability rating because of the prospects of N'golo Kante and Paul Pogba. 
Finally, in the value breakdown there is “Hybrid Ability”. This rating out of 10 reflects our opinion on how easily one could make a hybrid team with multiple nations or confederations using this team as a base. 
Top 3 European Starter Nations
Now that we’ve explained our methodology, let’s start by ranking our Top 3 nations for both Europe and South America. Those two confederations will have the most players in this mode; therefore, it seems appropriate to narrow this analysis considering they will be the bulk of your starter pack. 
#1 - French Starter Team
Starting off the analysis are Les Blues who are one of the favorites to lift the World Cup. But, how will they do in FUT's World Cup Mode? With tremendous depth, and quality players across all positions the French national team scores high in almost every sector. Their midfield looks OP from the start, while also offering a great backline. The only downside here may be the French players' pack weights.

#2 - Spanish Starter Team
Coming in just behind France is the Spanish national team. Looking at their players they have quality from top to bottom. Plenty of creative attackers and midfielders; however, they also have a good number of stalwart defenders. This nation will definitely give a user confidence, but they might be tricky to pack considering most players are rated above 80. 

#3 - German Starter Team
The reigning World Cup champs are set to embark on the long road to repeat, yet their Russia 2018 squad seems up to the task. From the WC mode perspective, the Germans offer tremendous value per rating in the midfield and central defense. Their attack is on the slow side; however, if you can start pulling players in their elite tier then you'll be set. Just like France, a major downside might be this nation's pack weight. 

Honorable Mention - Belgium Starter Team
A perennial dark horse for the World Cup, the Belgian national team also seems to be a solid sleeper choice for the WC mode. Looking at their roster, they have some really OP lower rated items like Christian Kabasele and Jordan Lukaku. Sprinkle in a great mix of elite players like Eden Hazard, Dries Mertens and Kevin De Bruyne and the Red Devils look like a solid nations throughout the life of this game mode. 

Honorable Mention - English Starter Team
A mixed reception when the Lions released their WC roster selection, but lucky for us the WC mode will have an expanded player base. In general, the low ratings of most English players make them an incredibly strong starter team, especially with the pace in the attack. Unfortunately, their downfall is a lack of real upgrade potential, so enjoy them while you can or pray from some major upgrades during the tourney.


Top 3 South American Starter Nations
Now that we’ve gone through our favorite Eurpean squads let head to South America.
#1 - Brazil Starter Team
No other South American nation could lead us off. The Canarinha have the perfect blend of starter options and elite tier players. It will definitely be a treat to receive these bad boys in packs, especially their CDMs or RWs. With great hybrid potential, role players can give this squad a leg up if you are finding Brazil players scarce in packs. 

#2 - Argentina Starter Team
Argentina's attack alone makes them one of the most elite options in this game mode. To complement their stacked forwards, the nation also boasts a quality midfield and decent CBs. A slight downside is their outside back situation; however, being in the South America there are plenty of nations to supplement that position. This nation also plenty of sub 80 overall players, so they should be abundant in our packs. 

#3 - Colombia Starter Team
Rounding off the top 3 for South America is Colombia. The historic soccer nation has tremendous value per rating almost across the board due to pace and technical ability. Unfortunately, they are low on the list because the nation lacks elite tier players and woeful goalkeepers. On the brightside, they should be easily available in packs so use their speed where you can. 

That is our analysis on the best nations to start the World Cup mode, but we would love to hear your thoughts below. What players are you looking forward to most? And, which nations catch your eye?"

You probably literally didn't see this one coming.
Unlike the past half-dozen or so Prime Icon releases, when each and every Thursday it seemed like some form of social media or another would tip which Squad Buildling Challenges were on the way, today we were all surprised with a couple of Icon SBCs -- and big ones at that.
Diego Maradona, who a Futhead source had stated they expected to be released alongside or near Prime Pele as TOTS arrived, is available as of today. The Prime Icon SBC is not for the faint of heart (or those without very deep pockets), but even with a three-star weak foot could become an end-game player for your squad.
Michael Owen's best Icon/Legend to date also arrives this evening. At around 500-600k, it might actually prove to be a bargain for many, particularly if you're looking for a strong link with Premier League players.
As is always the case, we've got loan versions of both Maradona and Owen available for the next week as well. With just 8 Prime Icons to go, we could be looking at two players per week releases for the course of the next month or so. Stay tuned."

FIFA Mobile's Team of the Year Event is in full swing.
The early returns are pretty well known in community and FM Leagues alike at this point: packing a starter is about as impossible as it seems to be on console. The bundles are steep at 15k FP, even for players that invest in the game. And while the grind is somewhat enjoyable, the length of the journey is such that it doesn't have the same fun element to it that Football Freeze, New Years and like promos did.
That said, the players are really something -- particularly the starters.
The most expensive -- both time and currency-wise -- defender/goalkeeper is none other than Manchester United's David De Gea. Arguably the best healthy goalkeeper on the planet at the moment, FIFA Mobile 18's DDG takes the super charged attributes of the player in-game to a whole other level. Let's take a look:
In-Game Stats
Even without training or copious skill boosts, De Gea's metrics are off the charts:

It's no mystery what puts TOTY De Gea in such rarefied air. His Handling (101 base) and Positioning (a daunting 106) are in a class almost by themselves. And though competitive player items will likely be released down the road in the future, for now, he's bested in the key goaltender metrics only in Diving and Reflexes (and both quite narrowly so).
On paper, it's not exactly a shocker that TOTY De Gea should be one if not the best goalkeeper in the game. But what matters is how he performs for you. So how does he measure up?
Squad
This is essentially the primary squad I've been using in FIFA Mobile (since packing TOTY nominee Toni Kroos, at least). It's far from the highest rated in the competitive Futhead FIFA Mobile league, but it reflects time, grind, and investment and usually gets the job done for me, particularly in League v. Leagues.
Though I have the Icon Lev Yashin trained 2 OVR higher than TOTY DDG's base, here's what I used during my personal evaluation process of the item:

Since it's pretty challenging to evaluate a goalkeeper on your own team objectively, I also roped in my leaguemates, long time Futhead stalwarts Darren8196 and JFernandez. You can check out their respective squads by finding the Futhead League in the Top 250 in-game.
Player Review
I preface this by saying, it's difficult to objectively quantify just how valuable a goalkeeper is in a FIFA game. Console has so much variance to the degree that only players with a specific trait (Saves with Feet) are sworn by. Mobile has been even finnickier, with Campaign Gianluigi Buffon and the aforementioned Yashin previously 1a and 1b in most debates as to whom the best keeper is.
As mentioned, TOTY David De Gea comes in with better overall metrics than all of the above. When you get to the extreme high ends of the game (pictured at the top of this article) -- which many of us won't sniff until game's end -- it does appear Yashin closes the cap and even surpasses him. But stats-wise, for many, many months, De Gea appears the on-paper champion.
In-game doesn't quite live up to the tale of the tape.
Taking my 103 OVR squad against JFernandez's daunting 115, a few turns in, I found TOTY DDG to be, well, a FIFA Mobile goalkeeper. Rainbow lob shots were getting past him; he wasn't exactly invulnerable to a well timed roulette-shot combo. But around my fourth or fifth initial turn of testing in-game game play against him, he made a tight angle save I've never even seen Buffon or Yashin make.
With the huge disparity in overalls, I naturally faced a number of counter-attacks in my test turns against JF. And DDG miraculously saved a couple. I can't remember the last time even my Yashin had done that without help from support-side defense.
His burst from a full stop on shots delivered a mixed bag for us. Darren found his first reaction to be sluggish; perhaps surprisingly so given his stats. JF concurred that Yashin is likely a little faster, a little better positioned more often than not, but that DDG's height compenstated somewhat and put him in position to make saves he seemed certain to be beat on. That more matched my experiences against him. Darren added that once he started moving, he was obviously very quick, but that perceived slow acceleration hurt him, even on things like long shots and chips.
What TOTY DDG does better than anyone is make difficult nay impossible saves. If you're coming in from the wing or trying to score from a corner, DDG may well be the best in the game at that. But he lacked that frustrating invulernability x-factor of the likes of a Yashin or Buffon.
DDG's Gumby arms lets him make saves he should have no business making, but Yashin and Buffon both come across as more consistently dominant than DDG was. While very good, it's tough to say defintively with the small sample size for the three of us that he is in fact the same keeper his stats suggest he should be.
Then there's the matter of XP and coin related training costs. While we certainly understand the desire to make TOTY players costlier to upgrade as to not prevent every higher spender in the game from having an unstoppable super team essentially overnight, the overcompensation and degree to which they tweaked it makes upgrading DDG a boondoggle compared to Buffon. Icons, like Yashin, were already expensive, perhaps prohibitively so to level for some. DDG takes it to an even more illogical extreme.
If you're a huge Spain (see: JF) or United fan, DDG might be worth the extra time and resources he's going to take to get him to the peak of his powers. But for the majority of players, as good as he is, a Top 3 keeper who isn't clearly the most dominant in-game probably isn't worth the added overhead.
Summary
DDG is very good overall, but all three of us felt Yashin was superior (and one preferred Buffon to both). With that kind of ambiguity, and given the steep cost first to obtain him and second to upgrade him, we have difficulty recommending him beyond as a status symbol or collectors item of sorts.

The calm after the Team of the Year storm ... or is it?
After a monstrous weekend of IRL football action, the general consensus was TOTW 19 could be one if not the most overpowered of the year. And while I'm not 100% sure it measures up to that hype, it's definitely top heavy in the best possible ways.
Neymar gets the near-TOTY item he missed by being bested by Harry Kane in the community influencer and EA staff votes. At 95 OVR, those who spent big to get his Ones to Watch dynamic item will be dutifully rewarded. Eden Hazard continues to scorch up the overall rating charts, now up to 93 after completing 9 dribbles and 3 key passes to go along with his goal output. Kun Aguero is the other big, big name, although the recently revitalized Thomas Muller has a shout as he returns to form under Jupp Heynckes.
Finally, if you want a sleeper, it's getting harder and harder to ignore Matthias Ginter for Bundesliga sides as he's now up to 86 with 73 pace. That could be quite the CB to pair with one of the heavier price tag centerbacks in Germany.
The complete FIFA 18 Ultimate Team Team of the Week 19 is as follows:"

If you were coveting another highly rated super-striker in this week's FIFA 18 Ultimate Team TOTW, the folks on EA's live production team came through for you.
Luis Suarez gets his third in-form of the game's lifecycle after a hat trick and five key passes for Barcelona. The special player item's Pace is the only real downside (just 85), but throwing a Hunter on that should take things more up to the meta-necessitating 94 or so.
Speaking of meta, the Paul Pogba of 'Calcio A', Sergej Milinković-Savić also get his third IF, after his real-life Man of the Match performance over the weekend. The venerable tank (with a recent skills upgrade to boost) will be bossing midfields as a super sub and in Serie A squads/hybrids alike from now until he gets that shiny blue-and-gold item come later this Spring.
Finally, it's been a long and winding road for Ones to Watch Romelu Lukaku owners. Today's your day, ladies and gentlemen. The Belgian's going up to 88 overall, and your dynamic item is going with it.
We'll leave this week's Team of the Week sleeper shout to you -- let us know in the comments below or on Twitter.

Michael 'Vfl Megabit' Bittner defeated Fouad 'Rafsou' Fares, 7-5, in the Xbox One Global Series playoffs grand final in Amsterdam on Monday to claim the title from the sitting EA 'major' champion Aldossary 'Rogue Msdossary' Mosaad. Coming into the day, neither player that reached the grand final was tipped to mount a championship run in this competition, marking yet another FIFA eSports event where a new victor has emerged.
Megabit's win over Rafsou was a tight one, the first and second leg ended 3-2 and 4-3, respectively, to the former. Both players were level on shots in both of the legs, and ironically enough, Rafsou marginally lead in possession. This grand final was a little different in nature, since both legs were ultimately played on one console -- Xbox. In other instances, the match is played over both consoles, but since this event only fielded Xbox players, the finalists did not have to worry about switching consoles.
Rafsou's run to the final was much more notable than the eventual winner's; Fares was dubbed ""the giant killer"" en route to the grand final because of the high-profile competitors he had fended off. Even before Wednesday, Fares defeated Barcelona FUT Champions Cup winner Donovan 'F2TeKkz' Hunt in the Round of 32. In the Round of 16, he took care of business against the Brazilian player 'Resende,' 7-3. And then, his competition really ramped up.
In the quarterfinals, the Frenchman came up against Msdossary, the reigning winner from the Manchester FUT Champions Cup, who had been obliterating opponents left and right. In 19 matches, the Saudi Arabian scored 62 goals while only conceding 35. The only four competitors to score more goals than him in the competition had played more matches or advanced further. The first leg between the two ended 2-2, but Rafsou overpowered his opponent with four goals off seven shots in the second leg to advance, 6-4.
The semifinals did not get easier, as Rafsou came up against the 2017 FIFA Interactive World Cup champion Spencer ‘FaZe Gorilla’ Ealing. Perhaps the most exciting second leg in the entire competition, Fares took a commanding lead early only to let it slip to Gorilla in the final minutes. After holding a three-goal lead, Fares let the Brit cut it to one with just twenty minutes left to go, but a swift counter-attack finish iced the game ten minutes later. The tie ended 6-4 to Rafsou yet again.
Megabit, on the other hand, enjoyed an easy road to the final. His first match of the day was against his fellow countryman, Sakul, a German player who showed promise in competitions earlier this year. The first leg ended 5-4 to Bittner, but a stronger 3-1 performance in the second took him through. He faced Sporting Kansas City's Alekzandur next, and won 8-4.
Bittner then came up against AFC Ajax's Dani Hagebeuk, who was fresh off a 10-4 win against Kurt 'Kurt0411' Fenech. This affair was predicted to be a close one but the German accumulated a steady lead on the hometown hero in the first leg and held strong in the second to set up a grand final between France and Germany.
With this, the Xbox division of the Global Series Playoffs comes to an end. However, there's more competitive FIFA to come this week, with the PlayStation competitors getting ready for the weekend. The broadcast crew will be back in Amsterdam Friday morning at 7:40 a.m. ET (12:40 p.m. UK time) for the rest of the knockout stages, including the Xbox One grand final. For a more fleshed-out look at the entire weekend's schedule, you can go here. Extended coverage and behind-the-scenes action can be found on Twitch."

The perfect prediction streak has come to an end, but we still managed to hit 3/4, which is better than nothing on a tricky international week. Going forward, it looks like international fixtures will dominate this upcoming cycle and could be the lionshare of inclusions for the next few months. We have adjusted our predictions accordingly, so let’s dive in
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to be selected:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Austria vs Brazil 
Match Info: We start this week with Brazil who missed out on last week’s Marquee Matchup SBC. There are a lot of hodgepodge fixtures, but we’re going to stay close to big nations that did not feature last week. Plenty of non-rare golds from either nation.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Russia vs Turkey
Match Info: The World Cup host nation squares off against Turkey in what may be the most balanced tie on this list this week. Could be quite entertaining, but also allows EA to include two nations that have sizable player pools.  

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Poland vs Chile
Match Info:  Still a bummer Chile won’t be in Russia, but they might have some consolidation with an inclusion in this cycle’s Marquee Matchups. Poland will be looking to vamp up for the tournament and honestly this match can help a lot of people size up their chances for making it out of their tricky group.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Spain vs Tunisia
Match Info:  Rounding it out is a matchup that checks a lot of boxes for EA. Spain is a high profile nation with a lot of gold options, while Tunisia brings a fringe diversity pick. It would allow them to give a decent pack reward, while still seemingly throwing a curveball. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 75 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry

            Updated on
            



After the Premier League special of Matchups for Boxing Day, we now have another special round to celebrate the start of the 2018 MLS season.
In a bumper week of Matchups, it will be tough to get all 10 correct, but hopefully we can get a lot of them right to give you the best rewards possible. 
So, let's get into the games. 

Toronto FC v Columbus Crew
Last season’s champions start off this season at home and will be hoping to start as they finished.
Toronto’s two pre-season fixtures ended positively, as they scored twice in each game. Having signed the former Dutch international Gregory van der Wiel, they have added some more top-level experience to their side to try and see them retain their title from last season. 
Columbus Crew lost out to Toronto in the semifinals of the MLS Cup last season, so what better time to get revenge than the first game of the new season? They have lost their top scorer from last season, having traded him with LA Galaxy in a swap deal for Gyasi Zardes -- a player who has had an instant impact with three goals to help his new side to the Carolina Challenge Cup title in pre-season. 
Toronto won three of the five encounters between these sides last season, with Columbus only winning one, so the hosts do appear to have the advantage. And with Toronto seeming to have the best side in the league, I can't see them dropping points at home this early in the season. 
Game played: Saturday 3rd, 6:00 p.m. (GMT) / 1:00 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Toronto win 

Houston Dynamo v Atlanta United
Both sides finished fourth in their respective conferences last season, and will be hoping to get off to a good start to try and better that performance this year. 
Houston haven't made too many changes to their squad from last year, so they will be hoping that that consistency will help them going into the new season. Having lost both legs of their playoff semifinal legs to Seattle Sounders, they made a strong start to pre-season, and will be hoping to push on from there. 
Atlanta are one of the recent additions to the MLS, and they have already shown they are an exciting team to watch. They ended the regular season as the second highest scorers last season, and have added to their excellent attack with the signing of USMNT international Darlington Nagbe. They had a poor pre-season with just one win from four, but are certainly not a team to be underestimated. 
Atlanta’s shocking form at the end of last season saw them miss out on an automatic quarter final spot in the playoffs, and they suffered for it as they lost in the first round and are without a win in their last eight games. This game looks set to be pretty close, with Atlanta’s team looking like it could be one of the best in the league, while Houston’s solid end to last season and good run in pre-season makes it not as clear cut as it may appear at first glance. I feel like this game could go either way, but I think that it may end up as an away win.
Game played: Saturday 3rd, 8:30 p.m. (GMT) / 3:30 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Atlanta win

Philadelphia Union v New England Revolution
Philadelphia and New England both finished just outside the playoffs, so will no doubt be hoping for a win to kick-start their season to try and get into the playoffs this year. 
Philadelphia have only won two games in pre-season -- a 5-0 win over Montreal Impact and a 5-1 win over University of South Florida -- so they may be lacking confidence. Their only real signing of note was David Accam from Chicago Fire, as they attempt to bolster their attacking options. 
New England lost just once in pre-season, in a 1-0 loss against Malmö, before going on to win the Mobile Mini Sun Cup. They struggled defensively last year, with the third worst defence in the league, but they have improved in their attack as well with the signing of Kei Kamara from Vancouver Whitecaps. 
I can see this being a close game, with New England boasting the better form recently, while Philadelphia have the head-to-head advantage with three wins to one in that last five games between the sides. I think that the hosts will take the three points. 
Game played: Sunday 4th, 12:00 a.m. (GMT) / Saturday 3rd, 7:00 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Philadelphia win

Orlando City v D.C. United
Orlando start a season for the second time in their history without the Brazilian legend Kaka. They have managed to sign a few good replacements to try and lessen the impact of that loss. Signing the experienced Lamine Sané from Werder Bremen should help in that aspect, while Justin Meram and Sacha Kljestan will aim to provide more attacking options as they try and finish better than their second bottom showing last season. Those signings seemed to have done the trick in pre-season, as they lost just one of their five games -- a closely fought 3-2 loss to Chicago Fire. 
D.C. United were the only side to finish below Orlando last season in the Eastern Conference, and ended with the joint lowest number of points and worst goal difference in the league. They have tried to solve that by signing Vancouver keeper David Ousted, along with Yamil Asad and Darren Mattocks to boost their attacking potential. They had a good pre-season, losing only to Swedish side Malmö, but only faced one other MLS side, so it's difficult to tell how they'll be able to carry those performances over to bigger and tougher games. 
Orlando have won three of the last four games between these sides, and I believe that they will also come out as victors this weekend. 
Game played: Sunday 4th, 12:30 a.m. (GMT) / Saturday 3rd, 7:30 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Orlando win 

FC Dallas v Real Salt Lake
This is another game between two sides who finished just outside of the playoff spots last year, as seventh host eighth from last year's Western Conference. 
Dallas lost just one of their seven games in a very busy pre-season schedule, so are in good form coming into the season. However, they also lost the first leg of their CONCACAF Champions League playoff against Tauro and play the second leg on Thursday morning/Wednesday evening, so they may have a few tired legs if coming into the game at the weekend.
Real Salt Lake’s poor start to last season is what cost them a playoff spot last year, having picked up just 8 points from their first 33. They have managed to hold on to their key players from last season while adding a bit more strength in depth, signing Wales international Adam Henley among others.
Neither side has made any big name signings to try and give them that little bit more as they aim for the playoffs this season, so it'll be interesting to see how they both get on. Everyone knows that a good run of form to start the season can set you up very nicely for the remainder. Dallas won both ties last season, winning 3-0 away and 6-2 at home, improving their impressive record of late to five wins from seven against RSL. I can't see RSL stopping them this time either, with the hosts big favourites.
Game played: Sunday 4th, 1:00 a.m. (GMT) / Saturday 3rd, 8:00 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Dallas win

San Jose Earthquakes v Minnesota United
San Jose just managed to scrape into the playoffs last season and will feel they have a good chance of repeating that, having managed to hold on to their key players from last season. An unbeaten pre-season puts them in good form coming into the season, and they face a team who hasn’t beat them in three attempts.
Minnesota’s debut season in the MLS wasn’t one to remember as they finished a disappointing ninth in the table. They have signed a lot of players to try and improve on that performance, but with no real huge names, I can see them struggling once again. 
San Jose won both ties last season and should once again be big favourites here. I feel that they are most likely to win as they seem to have the far superior squad and play at home should only boost that advantage. 
Game played: Sunday 4th, 3:30 a.m. (GMT) / Saturday 3rd, 10:30 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: San Jose win

Seattle Sounders v Los Angeles FC
Seattle are the first side to face the newest addition to the MLS, Los Angeles FC. 
The hosts have kept their squad very similar to last season, adding Norwegian international Magnus Wolff Eikrem to their side to bring some more experience to their team. A fairly mixed pre-season saw them lose twice and win five games. However, they have suffered a massive blow as striker Jordan Morris was injured in their CONCACAF Champions League game against Santa Tecla last week. 
Los Angeles FC have signed several big name players in their inaugural season, as they hope to make an instant impact in the league with Carlos Vela, Laurent Ciman and Benny Feilhaber adding experience in all areas of the field. Three draws against fellow MLS sides were followed by a win over Sacramento Republic in a successful pre-season campaign.
Seattle are big favourites, but there is no doubt that LAFC will be up for the game and they will be hoping that their big names will be able to help them pull off an impressive result against last season's runners up. However Seattle’s experience in the MLS should give them a bit of an advantage, and although LAFC may become a force to be scared of, I feel that it may take them a month or so to gel. 
Game played: Sunday 4th, 10:00 p.m. (GMT) / 5:00 p.m (EST)
My prediction: Seattle win

Vancouver Whitecaps v Montreal Impact
Two Canadian sides battle it out at the start of the season to take early bragging rights. 
Vancouver were top of the Western Conference going into the last game, but a 2-1 loss to second placed Portland Timbers saw them fall down to third. A first round playoff loss followed, making it a season to forget for the Whitecaps. They have strengthened over the break, particularly in attack, with the signing of Kei Kamara from New England, along with Sean Franklin and Efraín Juárez to bolster their defensive options. A very successful pre-season which saw them lose just one of their seven games has showed that they are back in form and looking to put that disappointment behind them.
Montreal were far less successful last season, finishing a surprising ninth in the Eastern Conference. A relatively busy break saw them bring in 10 players and get rid of 12, so they’ll be hoping that their new squad can gel together quickly. Things looked promising in pre-season, where they won three in a row, but a draw and a loss to finish off their warm up games may put a bit of doubt from last season back in their minds.
Vancouver should be big favourites for this game, having only lost once at home to their opponents in seven years. With home advantage, some solid signings and a good run of form, I can’t see them losing this one.
Game played: Sunday 4th, 11:00 p.m. (GMT) / 6:00 p.m (EST)
My prediction: Vancouver win

Sporting KC v New York City FC
Sporting KC had a strong season last year, finishing just four points off the top, so they will no doubt be hoping to make that step up. They have kept their team together, and signed a couple more players with good European and International experience as they look to bring the best out of their younger players. Four from five games at the start of pre-season puts them in good form, although a couple of losses after that may have made them stutter a bit.
NYCFC had a great start to the season, but a poor run of games near the end of the season saw them lose confidence and eventually underperform in the playoffs as they lost to Columbus Crew. Their poor form seemed to carry over to pre-season, where they managed just one win from four games, so they need something to spark them into form sooner rather than later.
The visitors had the better of the hosts in both meetings last year, ending 1-0 in pre-season and in the regular season. With neither side’s recent pre-season form looking overly convincing, I feel like a draw could be a likely result, but home advantage may push Sporting KC to victory.
Game played: Monday 5th, 12:30 a.m. (GMT) / Sunday 4rd, 7:30 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Sporting KC win

LA Galaxy v Portland Timbers
After a dismal performance last year, LA Galaxy will be hoping to find themselves anywhere except at the bottom of the table this time around. A few big signings, such as FIFA Mobile starter legend Jørgen Skjelvik and a trade with Columbus Crew of Gyasi Zardes for Ola Kamara should see them finish in a much more respectable finish in the league.
Portland topped the Western Conference last year, but fell to Houston Dynamo in the quarter finals of the playoffs. Over the break, they lost their key man from last season -- Darlington Nagbe -- which will be a big loss for them and one that they haven’t obviously addressed.
Based on last season, this should only go one way, but I have a feeling that Galaxy may pull off a bit of an upset and take something from the game. Whether they are good enough to get the three points is a different matter, but a draw seems like a fairly likely result to me.
Game played: Monday 5th, 3:00 a.m. (GMT) / Sunday 4rd, 10:00 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw 

With 10 games to predict again, and 10 free reward points on offer, there are also an increased number of rewards players to choose from. 
Six players are up for grabs, costing different numbers of tokens depending on their rating. Depending on how well you get on, you can pick between the following players:

85 Overall Sebastian Giovinco for 5 tokens 
85 Overall Giovani dos Santos for 5 tokens 
83 Overall Miguel Almirón for 3 tokens

90 Overall Bastian Schweinsteiger is only available as a drop from the 1k FIFA Point packs to get an extra token, or you can buy him from the market.
If none of those players take your fancy, or you have some tokens left, you can get yourself some coins or Skill Boosts instead.
As always, good luck and happy predicting!"

At the start of every new year of FUT, everyone will be opening packs. Whether they be loyalty packs or FIFA Point funded spurlges, the question on everyone's lips is, ""what should I do with my newly packed cards?"" This is a tough but important question. To try and tackle it, we decided to break down card types into categories with different buy/sell/hold recommendations for each. While there will be many excpetions, this should hopefully give you a good starting point. 
Consumables 
Broadly speaking, consumables can be divided up into two categories: Less desirable and desirable. 


Less Desirable Consumables - For less desirable items (i.e Goalkeeper training, non rare contracts, etc.), it is best to list them immediately. If you struggle to sell them, it is best to quicksell them. Utilize the coins elsewhere, and save the transfer list space. 


Desirable Consumables - These consumables are trickier. The two traditional options are to hold and wait for their prices to rise when the first weekend league rolls around, or quickly sell. If you consider yourself a shrewd trader and early coin totals are important to help you make more coins, we think it best to sell those cards. Otherwise, consumables such as rare squad fitnesses, all attribute trainings, and desirable chemistry styles have the potential to rise in price significantly around the 1st and 2nd Weekend Leagues.


Low Rated & Undesirable
Just like undesirable consumables it is best to just discard these items if you are unsuccessful in listing them. While you should always check their value on the market before quick selling, making use of these players to bolster your early coin totals can be a huge boost for your early trading and investing.

Low Rated & Desirable 
This is a tough category to define, but it’s one of those things where you know it when you see it. Low rated players with high stats in all the right places can sell for a pretty penny. If you happen to pack one of these you have two options. If they are a known beast from previous games (Renato Sanches), it’s likely that they will already be selling at a premium. However, if they are relatively unknown, their price may be lower than their potential worth. 
We suggest selling the overhyped, stars of old to take advantage of their hype that has carried over from FIFA 17. On the other hand, if you see a card that was relatively unknown last year with knockout stats, we recommend holding it until the a couple days after the full game is released. This is often when these “cheap beasts” hit their high points.
High Rated & Elites
If you’re lucky enough to pack a high rated or elite player, first off, I’m jealous of you, but you should also know that you’ve inherited someone of a burden. Right at the beginning of the game the amount of coins on the market is low. That means upper echelon player prices may be artificially low. As more people get access to the full game prices tend to rise dramatically peaking sometime during the early access/pre-order period, dipping at full launch, and then rising again through October. If you don’t want to try and time the peak during the early access/pre-order period, your best bet it to wait until their rise in early-mid October.
Squad Building Challenge potential
FIFA 17 introduced us to one of the greatest investment tools, SBCs. Before FIFA 18 these have already generated huge hype. So, if you pack certain cards that may be pinched be League SBCs (Super Lig and Liga BMX have already been confirmed), an upcoming Marquee Matchup, or even potential POTM, save them. Keep them in the club, or a specially designated squad. Check their price periodically, then when their value reaches your threshold SELL.

Market Overview
So much to talk about! Over the past week, the FIFA Ultimate Team transfer market has been hit by two big promos: Team of the Year and Prime Icon SBCs. As expected, the Team of the Year promotion drove prices down as players devoured packs in search of the best cards we may see all year. The pack opening spree caused supply to overtake demand and when that happens undercutting begins to drive prices down. 
On the other hand the Icon SBC included some great players as well, but since the SBC requirements were extensive, it helped to stabilize prices of higher rated golds and special cards. It was a tidy economic control move by EA to make sure we do not descend into madness… 
But, we’re all here to talk about the Ones to Watch (OTW) market. As usual, most OTW items followed the general market in terms of decline; however, a couple good performances and the expectation of a February SBC has kept many other items busy. So, with plenty to talk about let's pull a Busquets, and dive into this... 
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:   Let’s take a look at some big ranges as these always help investors/traders get an idea of where prices can go. So, big differences in Ederson Moraes, Kyle Walker, and Kylian Mbappe highs & lows demonstrates that these players have huge price potential which is great for knowing where to allocate some coins.
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take:  Besides a couple players who we will touch on later in the TOTW shout section, volatility was pretty regulated across players which speaks to the level of risk in players being similar. Yet, a couple stand-outs include Alvaro Morata and Corentin Tolisso whose high volatility suggest higher risk, but offer high reward, while Franck Kessie’s low volatility speaks to him being over invested (sell into the hype?!?).

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: From this week, notable beta figures include Nelson Semedo, Federico Bernardeschi, Leonardo Bonucci and Romelu Lukaku. Although most of those player saw price decline last week, their figures suggest that if the market continues to rebound their price can swing positive. 
TOTW Shout
James Rodriguez and Serge Aurier had very compelling performances this past weekend, and although Aurier’s assist wasn’t enough, James’s beautiful free-kick and assist saw him included in a solid TOTW.

In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner -  Serge Aurier (Tottenham) 
Again, a week where two solid options present themselves in terms of James Rodriguez or Serge Aurier. However, it would be too easy to chalk up James’s success to his TOTW inclusion, so Aurier earns himself the biggest winner in order to examine him further. 
Reviewing the Tottenham fullback’s stats, a high volatility (~7,500) coupled with an enormous beta of 4.07 provided insight into how this item was high risk/high reward. Hopefully you sold into the hype! If not, or if you’re looking to pick up Aurier now would be a great time. After an exclusion from a Team of the Week, hyped OTW items crash and Serge was no exception. This provides an excellent opportunity to get him while he is low. 
After stringing together a couple weeks of solid performances it seems it’s only a matter of time before the Ivorian gets an inform. So, look to snag a couple on open bid and sell into the hype.   

Big Loser- Alexandre Lacazette (Arsenal)
A tough few weeks for Arsenal have translated to some real disappointment for Alexandre Lacazette. So, the Frenchman finds himself as the biggest loser, and his weekly return definitely reflects that. 
A large volatility (~24,000) with a correspondingly high negative beta -0.95, provide insight into how every week without a good performances will drive the ex-Lyon striker’s price down. On the flip side there is always a silver lining, and as a player with undoubted talent Lacazette could turn it on at any moment and see his price saor!
Looking outside of strictly FUT, Arsenal seem to be close to signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and if these two men can link up top, many should expect the Gunner’s fortunes to turn. But, will this new addition overshadow Alexandre even further? (Million coin question) 
Recap & outlook
Wrapping it up, the release of TOTY earlier in the week drove prices down as supply largely outweighed demand. Then the Icon SBCs arrived and helped the market rebound, but looking at the OTW market the future has a larger impact. Some interesting final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Look to some of the lower volatility players at all price ranges as they will hold their price well so you know when you get the best deal. Then sell overnight.   

-- OTW investors: With prices low, the 82-84 rated items have solid value at the moment. Look to open bids for the best deals.

With the release of the League vs League (LvL) Master player upgrades a couple of weeks ago, everyone has been slowly working their way towards being able to upgrade them by winning 10 LvL tournaments letting you upgrade your Juan Mata, Andrea Pirlo or Luka Modrić from 90 rated to 95.
Having missed out on Player of the Month Heung Min Son due to the pricey Messi, I have been lacking a good second CAM for my team for a while, and had high hopes that 95 rated Luka Modrić would be able to fill one of the biggest gaps I had in my team.
This is the team that I used to test him. The games I played with him were in in LvL Tournaments, League Championships and the Legendary 1 and 2 division of Versus Attack Mode, facing teams rated between 101 and 115 Overall.

At first look, his stats aren't the most impressive, especially for a 95 rated player. 
Compared to other of a similar rating, such as the recently released Global Tour Master Christian Eriksen or Upgraded TOTS Dele Alli, Modrić's main attribute is obviouly his passing -- one of the least important areas for any player to have good stats in for FIFA Mobile. 
To get a better idea as to how he may play, lets take a look at his stats: 
At first look, his stats aren't the most impressive, especially for a 95 rated player. With his passing and dribbling being his top attributes, he doesn't necessarily lend himself well to FIFA Mobile, which is more centred around pace and shooting ability. 
Compared to other of a similar rating, such as the recently released Global Tour Master Christian Eriksen, Upgraded TOTS Dele Alli or even the Independence Day Christian Pulisic, all have what appear to be far superior stats in the right areas.
STATS
In around 20 games that I played with him, going between the three variants of 451, these are his approximate stats:
GOALS: 9
ASSISTS: 7
Not exactly outstanding contributions in either stat, but with CAM being a difficult position to find, he was limited in the number of chances he was a part of. The majority of his assists came from his corners, which were definitely a strong point of his game.
REVIEW
Pace: 5/10 - Sluggish is the best word I can think of to describe him.  He had occasional chances where he was able to run clear and get a shot on goal, but more often than not he was caught by a defender who many other players would be able to run free from. However, that was to be expected for a player with only 90 pace, and many of the opposition defenders had far greater pace stats which allowed them to be able to catch up to him.
Shooting: 6/10 - Sometimes he was great, and could score some nice curved shots from the edge of the box, but the next turn he could put an identical chance straight at the keeper or far beyond the far post. I feel like his inability to be able to finish fairly easy chances was the reason that I ended up getting demoted from Legendary 1 to Legendary 2 in the process of playing with him for this review.
Passing: 8/10 - Modrić's only real positive was his passing. Whether tapping or using the buttons, he was able to find his target the majority of attempts. When he took my corners, his accuracy was excellent, and resulted in more scoring chances than with any other corner taker. Sadly, passing still plays a minor role in the game, so his excellent passing ability goes to waste, unlike if his shooting was his key area of strength.
Dribbling: 7/10 - His pace obviously plays a part in his dribbling, as it reflects the speed at which he is able to move with the ball. His 95 Dribbling felt good when using his roulette, and his movement as a whole felt good. However, he sometimes felt slightly clunky, with loose first touches and letting the ball run too far ahead of him when he was doing a roulette past a defender.
Physical: 4/10 - His biggest notable weakness was his strength. With his lack of pace, you'd hope he'd have the strength to hold off some defenders at least, but no. He was easily knocked off the ball by even some more 'average' defenders like 95-97 David Luiz or Retro Stars Laurent Ciman, which gave him no chance against any of the top tier defenders that you tend to face in the higher reaches of the VsA leaderboard. 

SUMMARY
Is he worth doing? The simple answer is no. 
His stats simply don't perform at the level you'd expect for such a hard-to-get player of any level, never mind a 95 rated one. The stats of both 95 Juan Mata and 95 Andrea Pirlo are significantly better than those of the Croat. I almost feel like it was solely down to him that I ended up being relegated from Legendary 1 while testing him, as he was far too inconsistent with his finishing to be effective in that division. 
On top of this, his +3 Long Pass Accuracy is not going to provide a major boost to any of your players, and with such an abundance of other CAM's with better stats and boosts, upgrading Modrić shouldn't be a high priority for anyone.
Rating: 6/10"

Getting the starter squad right is one of the most difficult, but most crucial, aspects of the FIFA cycle. If you play your cards right, you'll end up with a solid squad that can compete in Divisions and the WL, all without spending too much. If you get it wrong, you'll end up wasting your hard-earned coins on teams and players that just don't cut it, and you'll fall behind right at the start of the game.
Today, we'll be helping you do the former. In this article, we'll be looking at the some steps you should take to build and maintain that killer starter squad without breaking the bank, as well as some of the mistakes you absolutely want to avoid.
Start early
In past years, EA have released the players database several days before the game or the web app become available (when this does happen, we'll have the entire database here on Futhead). Use this to your advantage. Spend a little while looking through the players, and thinking about potential teams you could build. I'm not saying you should while away hours looking over the thousands of players, but definitely take a look at a couple of leagues you might be interested in, and some players in those leagues. In particular, take a look at the lower rated golds in those leagues (75-80 rated), as these will be the staple of your squad. Also, identify some of the ""marquee"" players that you want at the start of the game - these are the 80-83 rated players who will make up the backbone of your squad. You should also just keep in mind a couple of teams you want to build, at a range of different prices - which one you build will depend on what you get in your loyalty packs/the packs you buy.
Once the game drops, and you have opened your loyalty packs (as well as any other packs you can open), take a look at how many coins you can scrape together.  Based on that amount, choose a team that you want to build, and start buying the players. You can get some pretty good deals just by bidding on the players you want, and waiting for the auction to expire, or by trying to snipe newly listed players for their market price. Be sure to check the market regularly, so that you can snag some deals.
If you follow this strategy, you should have a decent number of players for your team (or even your whole squad) in the first few days after  the web app is released. The combination of daily gifts on the web app, daily challenges and SBCs should help supplement your coin total, and allow you to build the squad. The target is to have a completed team - it may not be the best team, but it should be playable - on the first day the game is out. That will allow you to take a solid, full-chemistry squad into divisions, and start racking up those match coins.
Make the most of the Web App and Early Access
This is very similar to the point I was making above, but I really want to drive this point home -- take advantage of the web app and early access. In previous years, prices have been significantly lower during these early stages, as not everyone is on the game yet, and not as many coins have entered the market. This is prime time to buy the players you need for your first squad, and to make some investments.
At worst, the prices will stay the same on the official release day. But if past years are anything to go by, prices will sky rocket, and you could be sitting on a very valuable squad (which you may choose to cash in on).
Avoid Building Complex Teams
This is something that people people often overlook. At the start of the game, you don't want to be wasting your hard-earned coins on fitness or injury cards. Instead, it's better to be able to rotate players - you'll save a bunch of coins, and these coins can go towards bettering your team. If you have a very intricate hybrid, it'll be hard for you to replace an injured or unfit player without ruining the chemistry of your side.
For that reason, I strongly recommend building a one league or one nation squad. Fill your starting XI with the players you primarily want to use, and have a sub for each unique postion on the bench and reserves (e.g. if you are running the 41212(2), you'd want a spare GK, LB, RB, CB, CDM, CM, CAM and ST). That way, you can mainly use your first team, but have adequate players to rotate in when needed. These subs don't need to be anywhere close to as good as your first team players -- they are just there to tide your through fitness and injury issues.
Alternatively, if you do want to have a hybrid, make sure that you have enough players to rotate entire sections of the squad. For example, if you are running a squad with a Calcio A left-side, be sure to have players that can either replace the Calcio A side entirely, or can slot in without ruining the chemistry.
Dealing Fitness and Injuries
Building on the previous section, one of the best things you can do is to avoid buying fitness and healing cards entirely. Have a bench full of players who can stand in for their unfit counterparts, or have a second team that you can switch to when dealing with fitness issues.
However, there are ways to get fitness and healing cards without breaking the bank. My favorite method is the Bronze Pack Method (BPM). For those of you who don't know, all it entails is opening 400 coin bronze packs, and selling the contents. At the start of the game, you'll probably be able to make far more than 400 coins back, just by selling the players in the packs. The way I do it is I open a pack, and sell as many of the non-fitness and non-healing items as I can, and as soon as I've listed up 400 coins worth of items, I store the rest in my club. This method basically gives you free fitness, healing (and contract) items for you to use, and allows you to make a profit along the way!
Overnight Selling
I realized this in FIFA 14, and it was a game-changer. It's really as simple as it sounds - try to sell your entire squad overnight for inflated prices, and buy it back in the morning.
In the earlier stages of every FIFA, the market is remarkably predictable. Prices drop during the times when more people are opening packs (this is usually from 10am - 10pm UK time), and then rise steeply overnight. To make the most of this trend, you should always list your squad for sale overnight, at the inflated prices, and then pick up any players that have solid for their cheaper daytime prices. I've done this every year, and it consistently allows me to make coins.
Let's look at an example. I started this year with a Belgium/La Liga hybrid. I bought Musonda for 2K on the first day, used him, sold him for 3.5K that night. The next day, bought him back for 2.1K, sold him for 3.5K that night. Same thing on the third day -- bought him for 2K, sold him for 3K that night. By the fourth day, I had enough money to buy the player I really wanted - Yannick Carrasco. I did this with pretty much every player in my squad, and I used the coins I made to constantly upgrade my starter squad.
I recommend doing this for the first two weeks of the game (including early access) -- it's a great way to try out some new players, and build up a steady stream of coins that you can use to strengthen your squad.
Fit the Meta
This is the most important thing. Every year, the game mechanics favor a certain kind of player or playstyle, and if you want to succeed, you need to play that way. 
This applies to three things - players, formations and playstyles. This year, the 41212(2), 4231 and 4321 were dominant formations that allowed you to exploit the game mechanics. Strong, fast players with good stamina were a must. And fast, high-pressure play was the way to go (unless you were really, really good at possession or being defensive).
But how do we discover what is meta in FIFA 18? It's simple - it's just trial and error, both on your part and on the part of the million other FIFA players out there. One of the best ways is to watch what the better players are doing (the start of the game is a really good time to keep track of what the pro gamers are up to), and build on that. Try out different formations, and keep track of the ones that work as well as those that don't, as well as the squads your opponents are rocking. Test out different kinds of players, and not just one kind of player - this will allow you to find the winning formula in FIFA 18. 
In short, be willing to experiment. Don't get stuck with one squad or formation or play style - try out a bunch of things, and see what works. And when you find something that really works (and I mean really works), stick to it, and work on improving it (replace your already effective players with higher rated players with the same key stats). If you need suggestions on where to look for a good squad, I recommend checking out this starter squad analysis where we breakdown the best leagues/nations for starter squads.
Summary
There is no guaranteed road to success. Players may drop in price, a patch may completely change the game mechanics, and the market may be unlike any year we have seen so far. But in this article, I hope I have laid out some of the steps I think should work, as well as the mistakes I believe you should steer clear of.
You want to start early, and build a relatively cheap yet solid squad with plenty of depth so that you can adjust for fitness and injuries. All the while, you want to be trying to make as many coins as possible, and you want to be constantly improving your game and fine-tuning your squad. The point of this article is to give you some advice on how you can build a competitive team early in the game, and use it as a springboard to greater success."
5 Icons that would be great in FIFA 18,2017-07-02 06:17:09,"5 Icons that would be great in FIFA 18

While we know a handful of FIFA 18’s new Icons that will appear in the next installment of EA’s football franchise, the FUT community has been buzzing over which players might join the lot of Thierry Henry, Ronaldo, Diego Maradona, Lev Yashin, and the returning Pele. 
While the rest of the Icons for FIFA 18 are still unknown, these iconic footballers would be great compliments to the current confirmed crop of names.
Edgar Davids
Davids was a great defensive midfielder and a core part of those great Dutch teams from the 2000s. His dreadlocks, goggles, skill, and physicality would make him a Ruud Gullitt level impact player on any FUT club. Davids had 74 Netherlands caps in his decorated career and played for Ajax, Milan, Juventus, Barcelona, and Tottenham throughout his career
If the importance of CDMs in FIFA 17 is any indication of what to expect in FIFA 18, a Davids card would be worth a pretty penny on the transfer market. And now that you mention it, we could use these throwback kits, too.

Roy Lassiter
In 1996, Lassiter won the top goalscorer award in Major League Soccer, scoring 27 goals for the Tampa Bay Mutiny. The striker graced the cover of FIFA 98 in North America and was later traded to D.C. United that year where he continued to produce goals at a record pace in the MLS.
Lassiter finished his MLS career with a record 88 goals, only to be broken in 2004 by Jason Kreis. The forward also scored 13 goals in his MLS playoff career and is 3rd in that category behind Carlos Ruiz and FIFA 17 legend Landon Donovan all-time. He was a crafty goal scorer and would have four or five star skill moves to create a lot of scoring chances. Maybe EA will even give him a boost with his son, Ariel Lassiter, who is a member of the LA Galaxy.
Luca Toni
Luca Toni would be the ultimate sweaty goal target in the box. His ability to win position around the goal and finish headers was top class in his prime and there’s a reason why he was named to the 2006 World Cup Team of the Tournament. 
Toni scored 2 goals in the 2006 World Cup, recording 20 shots and hitting the crossbar twice, once in the World Cup Final against France. He has a nose for the goal and his Icon card would be a nightmare for oppositions to deal with inside the 18.

Diego Forlan
Though Diego Forlan is still technically active, and we’ll likely have to wait a year or longer to see him have a chance at becoming an Icon, Forlan deserves it. The Uruguayan forward has scored some of the most unbelievable goals that I’ve ever witnessed, but his style of play could make for a lethal CF in a False 9.
Forlan has scored 268 career goals across all competitions and once his stint with Mumbai City comes to an end, he should be in immediate consideration for an Icon card by EA.

Michael Ballack
As he continues to be one of the better television analysts in his retirement, Michael Ballack would be a great addition to the crew of Icons in FIFA 18. The German central midfielder could be your FUT squad’s swiss army knife, but what you’ll really want him for are his free kicks. 
I think this says it all:

.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }



What other Icons would you like to see in FIFA 18 (or beyond)?"

The Community Team of the Week train keeps on rolling.
While there was some expectations this past week's would be the final cTOTW, we appear set for another month of cTOTW and subsequently another potentially tasty Player of the Month. Though some have argued that the return of the big five domestic leagues should necessitate a return to the more traditional Team of the Week, cTOTW's evolution to more let the recognized winner (this week, 'themighty') have some say in the players involved mixed things up and made it more interactive and fun for everyone.
Plus, as noted by Futhead's Darren8196, Mobile TOTW struggled to maintain the same level of judiciousness its console counterpart did, conceivably in an effort to stay unique/fresh.
A Keylor Navas Master led cTOTW isn't the only release FIFA Mobile fans are getting this evening; as promised by Assitant Producer Tom Caleffi on Twitter, a ton of new Top Transfer elite players are here, along with an enticing new Master Player. If you've needed an OP striker but the 97s and higher have been a bit too pricy, can we recommend this new 96-overall Kylian Mbappé Lottin?
Mbappe's card progression follows a simlar path to Bernardeschi and Bonucci, going from 88 to 90 to 93 and finally to 96 OVR. Using the same PSG tokens as Neymar should be interesting. Will prices for the tokens spike, or will supply increase as those further away from the new PSG talisman look to make a quick profit? We'll have to wait and see.
All items should be available in game shortly. You'll be able to find them on Futhead soon as well.
Here's this week's September Community Team of the Week, in honor of 'themighty':
-- 96 GK Keylor Navas (Master)
-- 90 RWB Ashley Young
-- 91 CB Per Mertesacker
-- 85 CB Andrea Ranoccha
-- 83 RM Siphiwe Tshabala
-- 84 RB Elseid Hysaj
-- 85 CM Cristian Roldan
-- 87 RM Marlos
-- 90 LM Mario Götze
-- 91 ST Christian Benteke
-- 89 LW Kingsley Coman"

Market Overview
With Team of the Season about halfway done, and most European domestic leagues are wrapping up, we have come to an important crossroads in FUT. The general FUT market is a roller coaster of ups and downs depending on lightning rounds, and with World Cup mode approaching, prices are headed for a cliff. 
Amidst all the hype, and subsequent market crash, the Ones to Watch sector is nearing the end of its relevance. After domestic seasons end, these dynamic items will NOT be upgraded (unlike their Path to Glory counterparts). With their value-add gone, these items become glorified informs meaning avoid paying more than necessary on these items going forward. 
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats



The graphs above are concise overviews of all the keypoints from the data that I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:   Prices for most lower rated special items are through the floor at the moment, so there could still be profit during a price correction. The best way to do that is to look for desirable players close to discard with rather large high/low spreads at the moment. Looking at the graphs above, the likes of Michy Batshuayi, Alvaro Morata and Corentin Tolisso might have room to rebound.

Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take:  A week that saw some polarizing figures, Volatility is good because it means you can get in low and sell high, but that opportunity is being muddled at the moment due to the overarching price decline of most OTW items. So, in this section it might be best to stay away from items like Serge Aurier, Philippe Coutinho and Virgil Van Dijk.
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: This week, beta figures are beginning to even out across the OTW sector. With betas getting closer to zero it means players’ prices should be stabilizing, and it makes sense because many are doing so at their discard price. If you can be patient and snag a couple on open bid, Gerard Deulofeu, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Lucas seem to be at their low (although do not expect a drastic rebound). 

TOTW Shout
A trio of pacey OTW wingers have blessed the current Team of the Week. Starting off, Douglas Costa continues racking up the upgrades as the season draws to a close, while Bertrand Traore  also capped off quite the season in style (shame about the weak foot). Last, but certainly not least, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang put in quite the shift over the weekend earning him an even faster item. Hate to see that in the Weekend League
In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner - Ederson (Manchester City)
A couple Team of the Week shouts had sizable weekly returns, but we covered them above. This week the real big winner was in an item that had received tremendous amounts of TOTS hype, but ultimately missed the final inclusion: Ederson Moraes. 
The Brazilian shot stopper has been brilliant all season, and most likely should have made it; however, EA figured you could only have so many Manchester City players. Focusing on his price jump, Ederson presents an interesting trend that traders can utilize during Bundesliga and Calcio A TOTS. 
The keeper’s price skyrocketed because players were panic selling him in the lead up to the BPL announcement figuring he would have a beefed up card, yet when he missed out players immediately went back to snag the highest rated version. This increased demand drove up his price and enlightened us to a tidy trend. 
Now, going forward if a player with significant TOTS hype misses out it won’t hurt to snag a couple as quick as possible to flip in the preceding days. It can be high risk/high reward, so be warned. 
Big Loser - OTW Market
Last week we had the OTW sector as a whole as our biggest losers, and honestly I did not think it could have gotten much worse for them. Well, it definitely did, and with some staggering price drops the OTW setor as a whole makes this section for the second week running. 
I mentioned last week that there is always a silver lining when it comes to price drops as players become more affordable. I still stand by that, but the fact OTW items are losing their dynamic upgrade potential means they are losing the most important part of their value. Players secretly love guessing who can be the next Mohamed Salah when it comes to OTW upgrades, but with that luster gone (other than possibly one more bump for Salah himself), make sure to not be paying a premium on these items going forward.

Recap & outlook
The FUT market has continued its long slide, and with Team of the Season promos only halfway through expect that trend to continue. Where players should really be worried though is with the World Cup mode on May 29th considering when that drops, and players jump ship to that mode, items’ prices will plummet. Try to be sell your most expensive items by then, and that is especially true for the OTW sector. 
Again, it has been a pleasure to bring weekly analysis to the OTW sector, but it is time to hang up the boots until domestic seasons resume. Enjoy the World Cup and transfer window, because we are all eagerly awaiting a fresh batch of OTW items in FIFA 19.

As league seasons across Europe come to a close, the quality and volume of big in-forms is about to come to an end. But it's not all doom and gloom as the World Cup will soon be upon us. Aaron missed nine players from his prediction this week, so let's find out why:
Rafinha – CAM – Inter Milan
It’s a straight shoot out between Inter and Lazio for the final Champions League spot in Serie A, and the Milan club closed the gap to just two points on Saturday with a resounding 4-0 win against Udinese. The goals were evenly spread making the IF options difficult, but Rafinha makes the TOTW for his goal and strong performance. Both Lazio and Inter have winnable games this weekend before facing off in the final game of the season next week. What a match that could be. 
Aaron's View: I personally think Birsa was the better option from midfield after picking up an 8 from Gazzetta, and seeing as though I didn't pick Birsa, I couldn’t then justify Rafinha who picked up a lower rating than that.
Patrick Van Aanholt – LB – Crystal Palace
Crystal Palace are now unbeaten in their last five Premier League matches; a run which has comfortably secured their top-flight status for next season. And they poured further misery on relegated Stoke on the weekend winning 2-1 at the Bet 365 Stadium. The late winner was scored by Patrick Van Aanholt in the 85th minute, and this performance when combined with last weeks (where he narrowly missed out) see him make the TOTW for continued good form. 
Aaron's View: Van Aanolt seriously deserved a TOTW spot last week but was harshly snubbed in my opinion. This weak, he was a much weaker option for my prediction but maybe EA felt a little guilty this time?
Takashi Inui – LM – SD Eibar
Eibar put in one of their better performance of the season on Saturday where they easily beat mid-table rivals Girona 4-1. Kike Garcia scored a brace in the first half hour and then there was a bit of goal drought until the 80th minute when Jordan and then Inui finished off the scoring for the away side. Takashi Inui also picked up an assist to go with his goal, seemingly enough for his second IF of FUT 18. 
Aaron's View: I already had Kike Garcia selected from Eibar, and I don’t think many would have expected a second IF from the same game for a goal and assist. Especially when Gomez did exactly the same for a different side this week.
Salif Sane – CB – Hannover 96
After a rocky few weeks Hannover 96 finally put some daylight between themselves and the bottom clubs in the Bundesliga with a 3-1 win against Hertha Berlin. All three goals came in the first half with Harnik, Fullkrug and TOTW 34’s Salif Sane also chipping in with a goal. Sane also had 7 clearances and 2 tackles to his name, but without a clean sheet to go with it, I can see why he was missed. 
Aaron's View: The defenders in general were difficult to predict this week with few notable performances. On top of that the Bundesliga was also a pain. Sane fits in both of those categories and this IF perhaps suggests a Bundesliga TOTS snub is on the way? 
Mario Gaspar – RB – Villarreal
Villarreal have just two games left to cling on to a European football spot in La Liga and they put in an impressive display (before being hammered 5-1 by Barcelona) to beat Valencia 1-0 at home. The goal came late on as well with Mario Gaspar rising to head past Valencia keeper Neto after a set piece from Manu Trigueros. Crucial win for Villarreal especially as they lost in mid-week. 
Aaron's View: Continuing the theme of difficult to predict defenders. Gaspar on paper looked great after scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win, but literally every match ratings source suggested there were far better options.
Yann Sommer – GK – Borussia Monchengladbach
Gladbach took on struggling Frieburg and kept them closer to a relegation playoff than they would like after the had a chance to go six points clear of Wolfsburg. But, it was not to be with Gladbach winning 3-1 to continue this week’s unpredictables theme of both teams scoring. So with no clean sheet to his name Yann Sommer makes the TOTW for 7 saves against one of Germany's bottom clubs. 
Aaron's View: This one is frustrating as it was between Sommer and the Russian keeper for me. I feel that Kristyuk was the stronger candidate but seeing as both him and Strak were low ratings, Sommer’s higer rating seems to have helped his inclusion.
Steven Berghuis – RW – Feyenoord
Even though the Eredivisie title has been wrapped up for some time, Feyenoord have still finished the season strongly with 7 wins on the bounce with have featured no less than 28 goals. And three of those came on Sunday as they beat Heerenveen 3-2 with TOTW 34’s Steven Berghuis scoring a brace in the first half. Berghuis now has 18 goals and 12 assists for the season but this is his first IF of FUT 18. Wow. 
Aaron's View: With the ROTW TOTS next 10 unclear, I struggled a bit with this one. Berghuis scored two goals which made him far from a TOTW a certainty, and therefore I wasn’t prepared to gamble on him not being in the next 10 ROTW. 
Steven Maclean – ST – St Johnstone
Our second Steven of the week is Steven Maclean who was in great form for St Johnstone on the weekend as they hammered Motherwell 5-1 away from home. Maclean scored a hat trick in this one which he had wrapped up in just 56 minutes to fire his side to victory. Before this game Maclean only had 6 goals all season, but at least he’s finishing strongly I guess. 
Aaron's View: It was always likely that I would miss a striker this week as I opted for all five reserves from defence and midfield, but with all those selected scoring hat tricks or more, it became difficult to snub anyone.
Moussa Sylla – ST – AS Monaco
And finally, we head to Ligue 1 where Monaco’s latest young prodigy Moussa Sylla scored twice on his first start of the season to see off 15th placed Caen 2-1. The final goal came in dramatic fashion with Sylla netting in the 90th minute to seal all three points. Let the comparisons’ to Kylian Mbappe begin!
Aaron's View: I looked at Sylla and if the other options were not so heavily stacked with goals I would have included him, but with no less than 6 strikers being snubbed after scoring a hat trick, Sylla’s two goals looked miniscule."

Market Overview
Since the last Path to Glory, the Team of the Year promotion has concluded, and after a brief weekend plunge, the general FUT market has begun to rise. The Lightning Rounds fromTOTY were the main contributors to the price drop as supply outweighed demand. However, with the promotion over, buyers are returning lifting the market back up. 
With little expected until Lunar New Year, the market should continue to climb, so take note and be patient with investments. Now, reviewing the PTG market specifically, it was a tame week where most players' prices mirrored the market decline during the week. It seems that most are also following the uptick after -- and investors may be weighing whether we'll ever see an SBC requirement with these items.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  As the market begins to rise, it could be insightful to examine big high/low differences cause hype could drive players back to their “highs”. So, with that in mind, players like Rodrigo, Marco Asensio and Raphael Varane could be interesting shouts (and hey they all play against each other this weekend). 
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take:  If you're looking for high volatility, Kingsley Coman and Javier Pastore would be the best bets this week. However, even more interesting is the extremely low volatility at the low end. Players like Renato Sanches, Benedikt Howedes, and Sandro Wagner all have extremely low volatility which begs the question are these just worthless, or does someone know something we don't? 
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of a card to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: As the market creeps back up, a high beta demonstrates that there is a potential for the player to also experience a price uptick, so look to Giuliano, Lars Stindl and Joe Hart who might give you the best risk/reward outcome. 
TOTW Shout 
Unfortunately not much here, although Dimitri Payet has been putting in quite a few quality performances, so maybe EA throws a curveball. Still lots of football left, so don’t sleep on the PTG items.
Big Winner - Kingsley Coman (Bayern Munich)
Not many players saw a green weekly return, yet the ones that did saw some hefty returns. But this week’s king of returns, and biggest winner, is the speedy winger from Bayern, Kingsley Coman. 
The Frenchman’s weekly stats show a high volatility (~12,000) and large beta 0.89, and both of those speak to his price increase. Using those to look to the future, the ex-Juventus player has a lot of risk around those figures but also seems poised to keep his high price as the market continues to climb. 
Looking holistically, Bayern has plenty of football left this season in the Bundesliga and UCL, and since Coman gets solid minutes he still has a lot of opportunity to get another upgrade, and/or generate more hype.
Big Loser - Renato Sanches (Swansea)
There were quite a few players who fit the biggest loser bill this week; however, we turned our heads to Renato Sanches. The Portuguese wonderkid has been getting a bad rep in the news lately, but hey he’s only 20. Plenty of time for him to mature, yet that doesn’t give FUT investors confidence. 
Besides a large weekly return drop, the more interesting thing we wanted to examine was his low volatility (~450) and high beta (0.91). These stats seem to suggest that Renato is a risky asset due to his beta, but also that his price has stayed relatively the same (low volatility). That seems to present an awful combo of an item that will sustain a negative price trend. 
So make sure to stay 'wyse' with Sanches’ item, and remember the silver lining is that he could eventually pick up an in-form.

Recap
Bringing the analysis to a conclusion, the end of the TOTY promotion has seen the market begin to climb back up, and with the general climb the PTG maret has begun to elevate too. Although most items had negative weekly returns, the future looks promising. If you have some excess wealth, now might be time to take a couple risks, but make sure to diversify and stay smart.           

Let us know if you have eyes on any PTG items below, and expect a Ones To Watch update later this week.

It's Friday night, so that must mean more domestic cup Man of the Matches.
The current slate maybe isn't quite as sexy as the last on paper, but a few FIFA Ultimate Team aficionados will be glad to see at least one of these names.
Our own FUT Economist felt Anderson Talisca was slighted for a third in-form a few weeks back, but now in this latest MOTM drop, for his work in the Turkish League's cup, he gets a rather impressive looking 86-rated player item that could be a factor in many a Weekend League squads -- assuming of course you can make the chemistry work.
87 Angel Di Maria is the real head turner ratings wise in this current batch, and at left wing becomes considerably more usable than the two-star weak foot possessing base item he has. How far can ADM take PSG with Neymar presumed out for the remainder of the campaign?
Finally, Gianluigi Donnarumma might soon become your special item 'Calcio A' keeper du jour. Those ratings really look like something, and until TOTS at least, he may well be the choice for many a Italian league squad/hybrids players out there.
You can check out all of this latest Man of the Match batch here. These special items will be in packs until Friday, 10 March at 12 a.m. UK time."

EA SPORTS Production Team has graced us yet again with another group of player ratings. Earlier this week, they released the game's Top 100-61 players along with a few celebrated stars. This time, they have continued that announcing FIFA 18's Top 60-41.
Premier League fans will be excited to see that some of their favorite strikers earned upgrades. Golden Boot winner Harry Kane saw his overall rating increase +1 and Manchester United's summer transfer Romelu Lukaku increased by +2. Notable Premier League defender upgrades include Toby Alderweireld going up by +1 and David Luiz who increased by +2.
""Calcio A"" was shown love by the EA SPORTS ratings team. Napoli duo Marek Hamsik and Dries Mertens received upgrades as well as Juventus defender Alex Sandro as well as Roma midfielder [Radja Nainggolan].(http://www.futhead.com/18/players/3038/radja-nainggolan/)
La Liga will feel hard done by after seeing a few of their players' ratings. FC Barcelona's Sergio Busquets and Iniesta dropped by one while their rival's striker Karim Benzema saw a -1 drop as well. Spain's Top Division's only saving grace this round goes to Isco, who grew from an 84 overall to an 86. 
If you want to keep up with the latest released Player Ratings, make sure you keep eye on Futhead as we post players as soon as they are released."

Think Antonio Valencia deserves a two-star weak foot? Are you livid Gabriel Jesus doesn't still have the five-star skills he did in FIFA 17? Are you beyond mad that Harry Kane isn't one of the two or three highest rated strikers in the game?
Whatever your gripe with the current ratings/skills/WFs of FUT 18, EA's giving you the chance to have your say.
Using the form below, you can make suggestions as to which tweaks you would like to see during the forthcoming annual Ratings Refresh. Though every suggestion you make isn't guaranteed to be heeded (particularly the more farcical ones), the production team has used player feedback in previous versions of the game to help decide where they should focus their efforts. Last year's refresh took place in mid-February.

On to the next one. The fourth edition of FIFA 18 Ultimate Team's ""Ratings Refresh"", formerly known as Winter Upgrades is in the books.
The Bundesliga, Germany's top division, are the latest beneficiaries, with a trio of Bayern regulars, Mats Hummels, Niklas Süle, and Joshua Kimmich all sporting decent boosts to their NIFs and the former and latter to their special items.
As always, the rules seem a bit made up from year to year, so not all special items will get upgrades. If a players' NIF base upgrade has a stat the same or better than any face stats (or especially the overall) on a special item (Ultimate Scream and most FUTmas SBC items omitted), it should get an upgrade however.
You can check out the full list of ""Ratings Refresh"" so far on the Futhead upgrades hub.

We saw a lot of variance in Day 1 of our FIFA 18 Team of the Year community-powered ballot vote. One position in particular oscillated back and fourth between two candidates and at multiple junctures, three (!) different players were in the contention for the spot and all within a few hundred votes of each other.
Day 2 featured ... Less of that?
With now over 65,000 votes (!), in a bit of a surprise to us, the Day 1 leaders pretty much all solidifed their leads. Some of the top vote getters (which again, in the interest of not directly influencing the outcome, we won't disclose in full until our ballot is finalized Thursday, January 11 at 7 p.m. UK time) lapped the field even. But the lack of fresh blood amongst our vote leaders from Day 1 to Day 2 and all, it's definitely not too late for a number of these contests.
If you have a friend who hasn't voted yet, put our Team of the Year vote on their radar. If you're particularly outraged by the inclusion of a certain defender or attacker, make sure they know -- and who you think they should vote for instead.
WIthout further ado, here's our ballot's vote leaders (sorted alphabetically) after a little less than 48 hours of voting:

The first two FIFA 18 Squad Building Challenges are live.
As first surfaced in an extremely early Twitch stream Tuesday evening U.S. time, Besiktas' Ricardo Quaresma and Tigres' Andre-Pierre Gignac are the first league SBCs for FUT 18. Unlike FIFA 17, in which the previous domestic season's leading scorer received top billing, this year, the picks seem arbitrary. Because Quaresma was the leading returning assist man in the Turkish Super Lig, that seemed to be the direction they were going. But Gignac's special item throws a rope into things a bit.
Regardless of the new selection criterion, you can now either build a very early upgraded untradeable item, or sell the parts you have for a quick profit. Be sure to keep those Turkish Super Lig and Liga MX pack pulls!
But are these SBCs and others like them worth it?
Aside from the introduction of the Weekend League, Squad Building Challenges have been one of the biggest additions to FUT in years. It literally changed the game and how users approach the market. Gone are the days of predictable market shifts and common sense trading. With the addition of SBCs to the game, EA can shift the market drastically any time they needed or wanted to.
When the game launched, SBCs seemed innocent enough. More a puzzle game to get a few packs as rewards. All fun and games, right? And then the big one came: Premier League Player of the Month Raheem Sterling. That purple item that ruined your Weekend League on many a occasions showed the FIFA world just how much of an impact SBCs would have on the FUT transfer market. When the community saw the requirements to gain that shiny purple Sterling, everyone soon realized the demand would start to outweigh the supply and cards that had no business selling for anything were soon selling for 10x their value. Non-rare Manchester City players like Fabian Delph which were selling for 400 coins the previous week were now selling for their price cap of 10,000. 
That trend continued on throughout the year with a game of cat and mouse developing between traders and EA. The traders trying to predict the requirements of the next big SBC that would shift the market and EA trying to fool everyone. On and on the game went and the transfer market stayed healthy for the majority of the FUT cycle, something we haven't seen in perhaps ... ever. 
There's no debating that SBCs have been great for the market and user activity. The biggest question after the first year of these new magical puzzles is, are they worth completing? Obviously this answer will never be definitive as so many variables are there to wade through. Hyped releases, especially early in the game's lifecycle, like the Premier League POTM SBC's are ridiculously overpriced. Using some logic, if a player is good enough for a whole month to win the award, the chances are they'll have continued success for the rest of the season earning them more special cards and rendering their SBC cards useless. Unless you're a fan of giving away 300-600k coins just for a prettier looking card, it's not wise to pay for an untradeable card like this. 
However, that doesn't mean all special SBC cards aren't worth acquiring. Another new release in FUT 17 were Halloween ""Screamer"" cards and with them came several position changed SBCs such as a Douglas Costa card switched from LW -> RW and a Dimitri Payet card moved from LW -> CAM. In total, each card cost about 150k in coins to acquire, maybe even less if you timed your purchases right. It's these types of cards that are worth your consideration. Either position changes of useful players like Payet or special upgraded cards of players who may not have a great chance of future IFs like Costa. These are worth your investment for future use. 
Another instance of cards worth consideration were the rapid release of FUTmas calendar cards like Marcus Rashford, Emre Can, Luka Modric, etc. Each of these cards had their own set of requirements and if they didn't cost a ton of coins to acquire they were undoubtedly worth getting. Two underrated cards that were easily acquired for next to no coins were Loic Perrin and Layvin Kurzawa. Each could be had for next to nothing but could be slotted in on any French or hybrid team you were building. On the otherhand, players like Modric or Dybala cost so many coins that you are never be able to get back and have a good chance of future special cards. They just aren't worth it no matter how much hype is surrounding the community upon their release. 
On the rare occasion that SBCs reward cards that are guaranteed to be the only special version of a player is when you need to jump. For example: With the FIFA 17 calendar winding down, EA released the End of an Era series. Basically legend cards of players who were retiring at the end of the season. This is exactly the type of card you should feel safe investing your coins into. If you're confident that you'll use the card a lot, investing possibly 200-600k in coins is smart. 
There are no concrete guidelines for what constitutes a card worthy of buying. Everyone's different. However, you have to use some common sense when it comes to investing a ton of coins in these cards. There's nothing more painful than seeing a card you paid 500k for gathering dust in your club without any return value. Yes, I'm looking at you POTM Hazard. 
Heading into FUT 18 we now have a better sense of what to expect with SBC releases. Some tips on how to deal prepare for them are: 

Hang on to all of your low-rated golds and silvers (and even bronzes if you want)
Be smart with your coins. Don't buy into the hype and overpay unless it's a card you absolutely have to have.
Be patient and wait for rare cards with poor odds at getting other special cards 
Invest early in possible SBCs (Cheap Belgium, French, English, Premier League players) 


SBCs have changed everything and now heading into a fresh FUT market we have a better idea of what to expect. However, EA know this and will likely be out to trick everyone. Be smart with your investments and use common sense when spending coins unless you have all the money in the world and don't care."

Today, we'll be taking a look at one of the best midfielders in the game - TOTS Leander Dendoncker .

The 21 year-old Belgium and Anderlecht midfielder has experienced a meteoric rise -- he started FUT 17 with a 76-rated non-rare gold base item, and has collected an 81-rated in-form, an 84-rated MOTM, 86-rated TOTGS  and finally, this 90-rated TOTS.
This is one of the most complete items in the game with 530 face item stats and 2470 in-game stats, and an 87+ rating in every position on the field (without even receiving a chemistry boost -- with a 'Basic', he's 91+ rated everywhere).

Below are my stats with TOTS Dendoncker. I sub him on in the first minute of every game, into the CDM spot.
Stats:
Price: 50,000 (sold him on, bought him back for 35,000)
Games: 38
Goals: 15
Assists: 10
Chemistry Style: Basic
Squad(s) used: One of the squads I used was this one. (switch to 4-1-2-1-2(2), subbed on for Cyprien)

I used Dendoncker's 86-rated for a considerable number of games (40-50), so I have a good amount of experience with this item.
Let's get into Dendoncker's pros and cons:
Pros:
Defensive ability: Perfect. His tackling is flawless, with him always coming away with the ball, and rarely giving away the foul. His marking and interceptions are incredible, allowing him to shut down attacks just as they are beginning, or clean up any messes that may arise. He's the best CDM I've used this FUT.
Physicality: TOTS Lukaku, TOTS Ibrahimovic, TOTS Al-Soma, TOTS Higuain --- it doesn't matter, they aren't getting past him. He is so strong, so aggressive, so good in the air, and so powerful, that he is essential a wall that cannot be crossed. Throw in unreal stamina, and he can do it all game long. He doesn't just bully opponents -- he dominates them.
Passing: Wow. His passing was perfect; he can pull off any pass in the game, and he can do it with both feet. He must have misplaced only a handful of passes in all the games he played in for me. He may not rack up the assists, but he is absolutely the heart of my team -- almost every move goes through him. His passing range means he can't be closed down, and he is too unpredictable for an opponent to read.
Long Shots: Get him within 35 yards, and let it fly. He will either test the keeper, or score. He can rip them from any angle, as long as he has half a sight of goal. He just sits back, and if he gets a yard of space, he can be lethal. His shots are hit with so much power that they are virtually unstoppable, and they have a dip and curve on them that I have never seen before from a player of his stature.
Finishing: This stat in particular was so consistent that I couldn't leave it out. When he does happen to pop up in the box, he's scoring. His low driven shots are as good as the best of them, and his power and finesse shots are somehow top-quality.
Dribbling: I thought he would be a little clunky on the ball, but I was so wrong. He feels great on the ball; perfect first touch, perfect ball-control, and great agility and balance. He's incredible to dribble with, and the two-star skills don't make an iota of difference. Unbelievable.
Work rate: Did I mention he was involved in almost everything? He starts every attack, runs back to help with every defensive effort, and is always in the right position for a shot, tackle, interception or pass. He's one of the most dominant players I've used this year; you really feel his presence on the field, and he is truly a game changer.
Cons:
I don't know what to say for his cons, because he didn'tt really have any for me. I was worried that his pace might be an issue, but he feels like 80-85 pace in game, and that's more than enough for me. I was worried his two-star skills would be problematic, but his dribbling is fantastic. I suppose the only real con he has is that he's a little hard to link up with chem-wise, but you could always just stick TOTS Mbodji and/or cMOTM Najar in there and be set.

Overall:
This is one of, if not the best, midfielders in the game. I cannot recommend him enough -- he's virtually flawless, and that's him on 5-chemistry as a first minute substitute. He devastates opponents in all areas of the field. He's perfect coming back and going forward, and can do pretty much everything.
The best part -- he's just 30K. He's absolutely unreal, and someone you cannot miss out on. He's going to be in my squad for the rest of this FIFA.

Last week's score: 15/18
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad Link: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7215704/

Goalkeeper
John McCarthy - GK - 65 OVR 
This position for me was between John McCarthy and a couple of Swedish keepers, but in the end, I went for the source I have reliable match ratings for, and McCarthy was both Man of the Match in his match alongside keeper of the week in the MLS. In total, he made six saves in a 1-1 draw helping Philadelphia Union to a 1-1 draw.
Defenders
Vegar Eggen Hedenstad- RB - 71 OVR 
One of the easiest selections of the week came from the RB position, which is not something I can often say. Vegar Eggen Rosenborg managed to beat Sandefjord by the comfortable score line of five goals to one, with Hedenstad scoring two of those goals to pick up the MOTM award.
Yair Arrechea- CB - 66 OVR 
In terms of Colombian options, it was very slim pickings, and thus I am taking the punt on Yair Arrechea who scored against his former club in a 1-1 draw. The other goal also came from a CB so it could easily go either way but I believe that Yair officially picked up MOTM, thus giving him the nod.
Shintaro Kurumaya - LB - 69 OVR 
Although Shintaro Kurumaya did concede twice, the fact his side went on to win the game 3-2 will help him in terms of receiving an inform here. The LB was involved in two goals, picking up the assist on both the first and second, which should make him stand out.
Midfielders
Ricardo Lopes - LM - 72 OVR 
With Lopes already picking up a silver inform item, it makes this selection significantly easier as it means he will be a gold. The Brazilian winger, who plys his trade in Korea for the K-League champions, managed both a goal and an assist during Jeonbuk's 4-0 home win.
Albert Rusnak - CAM - 73 OVR 
RSL piled on the pressure to an already underperforming LA Galaxy side with a huge 6-2 win. Savarino was the star man with two of the six goals, but with him not being on FUT, and with the score line being so convincing, I cannot ignore the match and thus the second best option in Albert Rusnak gets the nod. The Slovakian scored one and assisted on another.
Simon Lundevall - LM - 67 OVR 
Elfsborg stunned Norrkoping with a 3-1 away win on Saturday from which Simon Lundevall stood out with both a goal and an assist. The Swedish midfielder claimed many headlines and thus I would be surprised if he were to miss out.
Michael Barrios - RM - 71 OVR 
The fact Michael Barrios, much like Lopes, will be a gold item helps him in this selection process. The Colombian managed two assists in a 4-2 FC Dallas home win over DC United. For the second week running, Roland Lamah was actually the stand out player, but with him not featuring on this FUT, I can't select him.
Forwards
Josef Alexander Martinez - ST - 72 OVR 
With Josef Martinez now set for a third, IF he is becoming quite the item to use. The MLS is often a good cheap league to use thanks to this time of the year alongside the MLS All-Star side (which he could be in line for a TOTS from). Martinez gets the nod thanks to the two goals he scored, helping Atlanta to a 4-2 home win.
Clint Dempsey - ST - 79 OVR 
Last week we had Lee Dong Gook, and although it is not quite the same, another familiar face is going to appear in Dempsey this time around. The American was involved in all three Seattle goals with two of his own alongside an assist in their 3-1 win.
Sebastian Giovinco - ST - 83 OVR 
Talking of familiar MLS faces, here is another with Giovinco. Much like Dempsey, the Italian found himself finishing the game with two goals and an assist to his name. Giovinco almost went one better, but the woodwork denied him of the hat trick. Toronto went on to win the game 3-1 of which Giovinco ran the show.
Substitutes
Wilder Mosquera - GK - 65 OVR 
The Keepers were by far the most difficult position to fill which makes getting the elite scores that much more difficult. I have selected two I think have a valid shout though with the second being Wilder Mosquera. With the lack of Colombian options due to many low scoring draws, a goalkeeper is the obvious shout, and with 7 saves to his name in a 0-0 draw, he does stand out. 
Andreas Hanche-Olsen - CB - 57 OVR 
Although my Norwegian CB was one of the three I got wrong last wee,k it was actually a pretty close punt seeing as another random defender with the same rating got in. This ones a bit more clear cur after Andreas Hanche-Olsen scored one of two goals alongside keeping a clean sheet.
Mauro Manotas - LW - 62 OVR 
Several players have been moving up to the next category recently in terms of level of FUT item although not many have made the jump from bronze to silver. Manotas could be about to do just that though after picking up two assists in Dynamo's 3-1 home win.
Kento Hashimoto - RM - 61 OVR 
Much like the Colombian league, the Japanese league also offered very little, largely down to all three newly promoted sides picking up wins. Thankfully Hashimoto managed to score twice in a 2.2 draw and thus makes it easily into the side.
Pedro Junior - ST - 66 OVR 
Potentially the first player to feature in two ""Team of the Weaks"" this year is Pedro Junior. The J-League striker was influential once again in his sides result scoring twice in a 2-2 draw to help them pick up a solitary point.
Pa Dibba - ST - 65 OVR 
Yes I have written this name correctly, and yes it is one of the best names we have seen. Pa Dibba makes his way into the side after scoring twice for Hammarby in their 3-1 home win over Orebro.
Bjorn Bergmann Sigurdarson - ST - 69 OVR
Another Nordic IF to end proceedings with Molde's striker, Bjon Bergmann Sigurdarson. The Icelandic forward managed to score two of his sides three goals in a comfortable 3-0 away win."

The last two new-players laden FIFA Ultimate Team Team of the Season releases are upon us.
The Serie A (known in-game as 'Calcio A) TOTS is loaded with a ton of FUT fan favorite names, including 97 Paulo Dybala, the recently snubbed by Belgium 93 Radja Nainggolan, 96 Dries Mertens, and of course, in a fitting tribute to the FUT 18 meta, a 95 rated Sergej Milinkovic-Savic. Neither SMS nor Nainggolan quite reach the all 90s or better ""face-stat"" ratings that last year's Blue Nainggolan did, but they're still monstrous midfield items.
Ligue 1, understandably, isn't quite as rich, but with a more favorable distribution of golds and rare golds than any other of the ""Big 5"" European domestic leagues, could lead to a better chance of pulling a blue for you. Neymar and PSG teammate Kylian Mbappe see their POTY and YPOTY items respectively re-released, now as packable TOTS. Memphis Depay isn't a striker, as many had hoped, but still looks like quite a beastly attacker. The possibly Liverpool bound Nebil Fekir looks quite promising to boot.

Nicolas 'nicolas99fc' Villalba topped Bayer Leverkusen's Marvin 'M4rv' Hintz, 5-3, in the PlayStation grand final Sunday to perfectly wrap up a dominant three-day tourney run. After finishing the group stages 7-0, Villalba went on to only draw two legs and lose one inconsequential second leg 1-0 in the semi-final to Manchester City's Marcus 'Marcuzo' Jørgensen, after building a 3-1 lead, throughout the entire tourney.
Despite being the underdog coming into the final, Hintz took the lead off a spectucular one-time finish from the six-yard box. Nicolas, wasting no time though, answered back with two of his own before the halftime whistle to take a 2-1 lead. In the second half, he added two more in the second half to take a 4-1 lead into the second leg. And it only took 33 minutes for Villalba to ice the final, with a sweet 'R9' Ronaldo Nazario goal.
Hintz scored one more of his own shortly after halftime, but a three-goal deficit was too much to overcome in 45 minutes, especially against this level of competition; M4rv scored another goal, a consolation penalty in the 88th minute, to make it 5-3 to Nicolas over two legs. With that, Villalba becomes the first undefeated champion at a competitive FIFA tournament, finally adding a trophy to his name after wowing audiences in both Barcelona and Manchester.
Hintz did not enjoy as smooth a start to the tourney; despite starting 4-0 on Friday, the German's seeding slipped as he finished 5-2, losing to JRALion and 'Hashtag Agge' Rosenmeier in the latter rounds. In the knockout rounds, M4rv took care of 'Dani_Fink' and Futwiz's Honey Badger before coming up against Man City's Kai 'Deto' Wollin in the quarterfinals, which might have been the match of the entire tournament.
The two legs were incredibly tense, ending 1-1 and 2-2, respectively. Deto forced penalties right at the death of extra-time in the second leg with his Ruud Gullit to set up an even nervier finish. Wollin went to take the lead in penalties as well, after being down one, only to succumb to M4rv in the end.
Japanese pro enjoyed an exciting Cinderella-esque run throughout Sunday, beating Hashtag United's Ivan 'Hashtag Boras' Lapanje, 5-3, to start the day. He went on to play FC Basel's Tim 'FCB TheStrxngeR' Katnawatos, another impressive competitor, in the quarterfinals and beat him, 3-2. Unfortunately, Web lost out to eventual runner-up M4rv in the semi-final; it would have truly been a fairytale ending to see Web play for the title against Villalba, as the two are training partners in the off-season.
With that, the stage is set for the FIFA eWorld Cup in London in August. Audiences will see 32 players from the past week -- 16 from each console -- square off yet again, however this time, the tournament won't be limited to just Xbox or PlayStation competitors. The stakes will also be much higher, as players will be competing to become the next world champion (as well as claim a massive cash prize). We'll see you then."

Aaron bounced back marvelously from his infamous TOTW 22 performance with another outstanding set of predictions which leaves just five TOTW 24 players for the ""Unpredictables"" line-up. But, we still have an AC Milan revival to examine, as well as the curious case of Gabriel Torres.
Alessio Romagnoli – CB – AC Milan
AC Milan’s resurgence under Genaro Gattuso gathered yet more pace on the weekend as AC made it eight games unbeaten in Seria A with Sunday’s away win at Roma probably the most impressive of the lot. Goals from Calabria and Cultone did the damage but it’s the blossoming partnership between Bonucci and Romagnoli which is proving to be the foundation for their success. 14 clearances and 6 aerial duels won sees Alessio join TOTW 24. 
Aaron's View: The Romagnoli vs Calabria decision was very difficult with both players scoring 7.5 from Gazzetta. Calabria scored the goal while Romangnoli was solid at the back. I opted for the goal scorer, but it appears the Gold factor was the decider for EA. 
Santiago Arias – RB – PSV
PSV are still top, and still winning matches with relative ease as was proved in their 3-1 win against fifth placed Feyenoord on Sunday. However, the award of the IF to Santiago Arias wasn’t quite as clear as the result, because even though he scored there were brighter performances from his team mates Periero and Bergwijn, who each notched a goal and an assist. That made this one tough to predict but all the same Arias grabs a SIF and a decent upgrade too. 
Aaron's View: Defensive options generally were slim this week and therefore Arias picks up his SIF in just a few weeks for his goal against Feyenoord. I still feel as though the Dutch keepers have been robbed this week though.
Adrian Mierzejewski – RM – Sydney FC
It was the Sydney derby in the A-League this weekend where Sydney FC made their table topping form pay as they beat the Western Sydney Wanderers 3-1 at home. And the man at heart of the action for Sydney FC was once again Adrian Mierzejewski who scored either side of half time to take his goal tally to 12 in 16 league games. in this form, he’ll likely be pushing for a spot in Poland's World Cup squad. 
Aaron's View: Mierzejwski almost made my prediction however the consistently robbed Marega pushed Pukki to the reserves, and in turn Mierzejewski out of the side. I probably need to be stricter about the five non-gold layout as it seems to be a reoccurring theme.
Kengo Nakamura – CAM – Kawasaki Frontale
It was the first match weekend of this seasons J-League and that always provides the potential for IF’s to appear in FUT 18. The award for Kengo Nakamura’s single goal against Jubilo Iawata is perhaps a bit of a surprise, but given that no one else in the J-League scored more than one goal on the opening weekend, it left things wide open for five or six J League players to make TOTW 24.

Aaron's View: Nakamura is the only player that I feel is a bit cheap this week in an overall good selection from EA. It was the return on the J-League which is probably the reason that Nakamura was selected over various other players who did more.
Gabriel Torres – ST – Huachipato
Huachipato have made a good start to the league season in Chile where they currently occupy third place after four games. The same can’t be said for their weekend opponents Universidad de Concepcion which are rock bottom and were duly despatched 3-0. Gabriel Torres bagged a hattrick and strolls his way in to TOTW 24. But, there is more at play here as Aaron will tell you. 
Aaron's View: This one is confusing. Yes, Torres scored three goals, but the Chilean league has been unable to pick up IFs since the beginning of FUT 18 due to licensing issue. Torres started off in the Swiss league, which EA have the rights to, but his accomplishment came in his new league, which they don't. Seems the mixup was ultimately addressed with Torres being removed from TOTW and his base item from packs. Very odd stuff."

A much better TOTW offering this week means more interesting packs for you and less unprdictables for me. With the TOTY items also in play, there's plenty of options to go for on the market or via packs. As always lets see who we missed and better yet why:
Heung Min Son – LM – Spurs
Spurs were back to their free-flowing best against Everton on the weekend, with Eriksen’s goal in particular (where every player touched the ball at least once) a real advert for Pochettino’s style of play. Kane grabbed his now routine brace, but Heung Min Son also got in on the act scoring one and assisting another to secure yet another IF in FUT 18.

Aarons View:  I felt that it was too soon for a TIF Son, but with a convincing win for Spurs, it looks to have given him the edge.
Frederick Sorenson – RB – FC Koln
They may be rock bottom of the Bundesliga and six points adrift, but two big wins against Schalke and Monchengladbach either side of Christmas have given Koln fans genuine hope of survival. Fredrick Sorensen makes TOTW 18 for his goal from right back in there 2-1 win against Gladbach and with fellow strugglers Hamburg up next, a win there could make things very interesting at the foot of the Bundesliga. 
Aarons View:  Sorenson’s exclusion from Kicker’s TOTW lead me to exclude him from the side, with a goal in a week which was severely limited in defence it seems to have helped his case.
Franco Cervi – LM – Benfica
The big game in Portugal on the weekend was undoubtedly Benfica against Braga where two of the top four sides battled it out to keep pace with Sporting CP and Porto. Benfica ran out 3-1 winners with goals for Jonas, Salvio and Jimenez proving too much for Braga. Franco Cervi was on assist duty in this one with two to his name. 
Aarons View:  Two assists for Cervi but with multiple players already from his league predicted I looked elsewhere. A fair selection nevertheless. 
Manu Garcia – CM – Alaves
Alaves are well and truly in a La Liga relegation battle sitting just outside the bottom three, but that didn’t stop them putting in a really strong performance against Sevilla where they recorded a surprise 1-0 win. They had to hang on a bit at the end after Duarte was sent off on 82 minutes, but Manu Garcia’s solitary strike was enough for a huge three points for Alaves.

Aarons View:  Garcia picked up a three stars from MARCA, but with just a single goal to his name, I felt that other options were superior.
Denis Bouanga – LM – FC Lorient
Ligue 2 action now, where FC Lorient ended up comfortable winners against GFC Ajjacio 4-1. Denis Bouanga scored one and assisted another to take his place in TOTW 18. Although this is a tough one to pick-up as there were some slightly better performances out there across Europe this week. 
Aarons View:  Honestly, I missed the assist on this one and didn't really consider him.
Murilo Frietas – LM – Tondela
After a tough start to the season Tondela have shored things up in recent weeks taking 10 points from a possible 15 in the Liga NOS. And one of those wins came on Sunday against Feirense where Murillo Frietas scored twice including a 95th minute extra time strike to make sure of their 3-1 win for his side. 
Aarons View: There were several options from Portugal this week and many of them had two goals. Frietas was always an option, but I opted for alternate players with the exact same case.
Sergio Araujo – ST – AEK Athens
For the second week running we have another AEK Athens IF in the Unpredictables line-up and this time it’s Sergio Araujo. The Argentinian bagged twice in AEK’s 3-1 win against Giannina which extended his sides unbeaten run to nine league matches. As discussed last week, things are incredibly tight at the top of the league with one point separating three teams.
Aarons View:  AEK seem to be in the limelight recently with two recent IFs, both of which have been pushing it. Two goals for Araujo, who is included over several with two goals and an assist to their name."

Let the speculation begin.
WIth Team of the Season official coming to an end after seven weeks, EA teased three future promotions, both in-game and in the FUT 17 Mobile App late Friday. ""End of an Era"", ""FUTTIES"" (Voting in particular) and ""Marquee Transfers"" (maybe Ones to Watch on steroids?) were all showcased in the above interstitial with the promise that the FUTTIES would begin on Friday, July 7, 2017. About 10 minutes afterwards, the official FIFA Twitter account tweeted a similar announcement.
Perhaps voting this year will be conducted by completing Squad Building Challenges pertaining to the nominees.
""End of an Era"" would probably suggest SBCs for legends like Francesco Totti, Philipp Lahm, and Xabi Alonso, who all recently called it a career after long and prodigious runs.
You can expect to find the players nominated for FUTTIES here, whenever those go live. When specifically that will be, what the categories will included, and more details will be added as we have them.
What would you like to see now that FUT's ""regular season"" has come to pass?"

Market Overview
With the release of Player of the Month, the market is now completely focused on the Team of the Year. Arguably the most important event of FUT each year, TOTY has prices bending to its will. Over the past week, the market rose ever so slightly (especially during WL buying); however, it is now looking like it is turning down. 
Uncertainty about player prices has led many to wait to buy, and with the lack of buying we see a decline in item value. This is more apparent in the Icon market, especially the “cheaper” ones. Another little interesting thing to note is that the special item market has risen a little as many players begin to invest heavily. 
Just as players are beginning to invest, a large area of that for FUT players is Ones to Watch items. Players are hoping to see an SBC in February, and that is apparent in the low end items rising tremendously this week. But there’s plenty more to talk about so let's hit it:
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  We always like to highlight players with big difference in their range since it could be the best for investors that want to see potential profit. Players like Serge Aurier, Bertrand Traore and James Rodriguez are great examples of items with a lot of room to grow in value.
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take:  Interestingly, elite players like Neymar and Kylian Mbappe have had really low volatility compared to other weeks which could signal they are leveling out in price, while Mohamed Salah and Kyle Walker could be poised for a rebound.

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Looking at the best risk/reward potential, the players with high betas that stand out are Alexander Lacazette, Nelson Semedo and Corentin Tolisso. All these players could be primed for huge jumps if they put in quality performances. 
TOTW Shout
This week saw three players receive HUGE hype for a TOTW spot, yet Federico Bernardeschi, Leonardo Bonucci and Douglas Costa were all snubbed. Poor luck for the Serie A men, but hopefully you sold into the hype.
In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner -  Federico Bernardeschi (Juventus)
This week we saw two players with greater than 100% returns! That’s insane!!! We decided to highlight a player who hasn’t feature before in Bernardeschi, while Bonucci takes a back seat this week (consolation if he makes TOTY). 
The ex-Fiorentina star sported a huge volatility (`11,500) and beta (2.28), which of course is due to the enormous hype. For a player that has seen moderate gains and losses for some time it was wonderful to see him pull out of mediocracy. That being said, those figures above show that Berna is a high risk/high reward asset for TOTW inclusion, and now that he got snubbed that price plummeted. 
So, looking back we can (re)learn that with players like Bernardeschi it's best to sell into the hype, and we also feel it's important to note that his price experienced an extreme drop that could be good for reinvesting for a OTW SBC.
Big Loser- Ederson Moraes (Manchester City)
This doesn’t happen much. A player who was just a Big Winner is now a Big Loser. Well, Ederson Moraes has done it. The Man City keeper is not here due to him playing poorly or injury, rather because of a price trend we’ve seen all year!
With Ones to Watch over the course of FIFA 18, when a player's item gets upgraded, like Ederson, the following week usually sees big losses. Only Mbappe has broken this curse, but the main message here is to sell into the hype! 
As usual, the silver lining here is that Ederson’s price drop leads him to be more affordable; thereby, an easier investment option. He has serious hype, but stay 'wyse' and sell into it.
Recap & outlook
To wrap it up, the overall market is beginning to turn downwards, yet special cards are gaining value due to investors. The OTW market is a great reflection of that as seen by the large returns of the lower end items. It was also a big week in hype for the Calcio A player but, their exclusion from TOTW reinforces the selling into the hype montra.  Some interesting final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: It's not the easiest moment to flip OTW items; however, throwing up some open bids and then listing overnight can still work well with patience.   

-- OTW investors: The window to invest is getting slimmer. Other  FUT players have already begun to buy up items in anticipation of that February SBC.
Let us know some of your thoughts and investments made over the week, and if you want more dynamic player analysis check out our latest Path to Glory update!

            Updated on
            



Last week’s Marquee Matchups cycle was filled with a ton of rivalries that could have warranted EA’s selection. It felt nice to get the lionshare of the predictions right, and so we'll try to the best of our ability to keep our hot streak going! Overall, predictions this week were a little different as it seems a quiter week for derbies and top of the table clashes. That uncertainty just leaves that much more room for profit if you can get in on a couple correct picks. 
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Manchester United vs Liverpool
Match Info:  The PL has had a lot of quality matches over the past few weeks, but that's to be expected as the season enters the home stretch. This week, two of the most historically successful English clubs square off in a clash that has serious top four implications. The only doubt here is that Liverpool featured two weeks ago.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Bohemians vs St. Patrick's 
Match Info:  Bohemians got snubbed when the Irish league kicked off; however, they have another shout to be included this week. With Saint Patrick’s Day right around the corner this could be a cheeky play by EA to get Irish players off the market. Do not overpay for these players, but they could hold their value through the Saint Patrick's Day promo.  

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 68 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Genk vs Gent
Match Info:  Don’t sleep on the Pro League; for some reason every time they are included in Marquee Matchups, our pack pulls are next level. Yes, that may just be superstition, but a real derby between these two sides means this could very well make EA’s final selection. Again, non-rare golds should yield the best returns.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Borussia Dortmund vs Frankfurt
Match Info: An interesting pick to some, but this is actually a top four clash in the Bundesliga. Frankfurt is having a great season, while Dortmund are trying to finish second once again. Not only should this be a great watch, it seems to be flying under the radar for a lot of investors despite being such a big match.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there tends to be some variance each week, let's take a look at some more outside the box picks that could make their way in:
Heracles vs FC Twente
Match Info:  Honestly, the first sleeper on the list was a hard fixture to push down. Hopefully you’re reading this one because the derby between these two Dutch sides could be very profitable. Make sure to invest in the highest rated non-rares you can find. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Aston Villa vs Wolves
Match Info: If EA choose to let the PL have a rest from Marquee Matchups, the Championship could step up. This week there are a couple derbies in the league, but since Derby vs Nottingham already featured it leaves us with Aston Villa vs Wolverhampton. A variant of the West Midlands Derby, this rivalry could produce a tidy profit considering both teams quantities of non-rares.  

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Huracan vs San Lorenzo
Match Info: The  Argentine League has not been receiving much love from EA lately, but in a week that lacks derbies this sleeper is honestly one of the better picks. Plenty of non-rare options to go around here, plus in the coming weeks there are some other big derbies that should keep these cards’ values high.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Celtic vs Rangers
Match Info: The Old Firm graces our predictions again; however, its merely a sleeper because EA tend to avoid duplicating matchups in this SBC. Since it is such a huge rivalry it still needs to be mentioned; however, keep in mind it has already featured and Rangers was in the SBC two weeks ago. 

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 68 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
Hello darkness my old friend, we’ve come to the Greek league again. Hopefully we can get a streak started here with the Double-headed Eagle derby. 
PAOK vs AEK Athenns

With FIFA 18 Early Access on Xbox dropping today and pre-order access starting across the board on the 26th September, it’s about time you started to think about your first Career Mode play through. And what better way to do so than with Futhead's Top Career Mode Tips! 
If you’ve missed any of our FIFA 18 Career Mode coverage to date, catch-up with all the new features here.
Revive a fallen giant
If you’re a Career Mode fan I’m sure you’ve already read countless “best clubs to use in Career Mode” guides over the years, which definitely have their merits. But more often than not their criteria for recommendation is based around either an abnormally large transfer budget, a brilliant set of young players, or high quality loan players returning for season two. Those are all great things to have in their own right but for me, I want to have a bit of narrative running though my Career Mode experience. 
Which is why you should consider reviving a fallen giant, of which there are many littering the second and even third tiers of FIFA 18’s confirmed list of leagues and clubs. 
Leeds United – Once Champions League semi-finalists and winners of the old Division 1 just before the Premier League era began. Leeds United have since lurched from one disaster to another, with the days of Bowyer, Kewell and Viduka nothing more than a distant memory. They seem however to be back on track this season, but with a Premier League promotion push beckoning, can you take Leeds beyond that and back to the top table of European football? 
Parma – After their relegation to Serie D following liquidation, Parma have since secured multiple promotions in quick succession which now see them back in Serie B, just one step away from the Italian top flight. Everyone remembers the famous Parma side of 1999 which contained Buffon, Cannavaro, Thuram, Sousa and Crespo so can you rebuild a new squad befitting of those legendary players of the 90's?
Nottingham Forest – There aren’t many clubs outside their current top flight which can boast one major European trophy let alone two, but under the management of Brian Clough that’s exactly what Nottingham Forest did in 1979 and again in 1980. In recent history Forest have existed outside of the top flight since 1999 and are in need of fresh managerial blood to get them back where they belong. 
Dusseldorf – With a population of near 600,000 people (bigger than Dortmund) and a 55,000 seater stadium, Fortuna Dusseldorf are the very definition of a sleeping German giant. Everything is in place for success off the pitch and yet on it, Dusseldorf have only spent one season in the Bundesliga top tier since 1997. That’s just not good enough for a club of this size and it needs correcting. 
Other notable mentions: Aston Villa, Sheffield Wednesday, Hertha Berlin, Kaiserslautern, Palermo. 
There’s of course the “Galatico” method of playing (and buying) in Career Mode and if that’s your thing, good luck to you. But if you’re looking for something a little bit different this year one of these scenarios could be for you. And if you’ve got any scenarios of your own, hit the comments with the back-story of your local club.

Use the Youth Academy
If you are planning on using a lower league team in Career Mode, then do not underestimate the power of the Youth Academy. The feature itself may have been neglected over the years but don’t let its shoddy menu design fool you. It can still add plenty of value to your team both on and off the pitch. 
The first step is to get your Youth Scout recruited, and send him out on his first assignment. Recruiting the scout removes funds from your Transfer budget, so make sure you do it first otherwise you’ll know no doubt spend it. The region they scout doesn’t matter too much but I’d recommend looking for “Technically Gifted” players, as they tend to yield the best rewards later on. 
After a month you’ll receive a scout report which will list potential players to sign. Ignore anyone with a predicted overall less than 80, and if you see anyone with 92+ grab them immediately, regardless of position. Once they’re signed try to leave them in the academy if you can. They will continue to develop there, and their predicted OVR can change. If you move them in your main squad early, some of the development burden will be transferred to you. 
After that if they’re good enough you can play them, or sell them to boost your transfer funds. Either way, after a season or two the Youth Academy will have paid back its initial investment considerably.

Use the new Sell On fees
To go with the Youth Academy section above, FIFA 18 now gives you the ability to add future sell-on clauses to the contracts of players you’re selling. Which as you can imagine for youth players could result in some large future windfalls should they go-on to fulfil their potential elsewhere. So if you do decide to sell a player from your youth squad, or academy then make you insert the new sell-on clause. Even if you can only negotiate 10%, that could represent millions to your budget in a few seasons time. 
Setup multiple team sheets
It’s been a few years since FIFA’s Team Management UI got a welcome overhaul, and that process has continued for FIFA 18 with Quick Subs the latest new option for improved Career Mode squad management. However, something I always do when starting a brand new save is setup multiple Team Sheets for my club. 
So if you want to change from a 4-4-2 to a 3-4-3 quickly, with differing tactics you should build multiple Team Sheets from the Team Management menu. It's super easy to setup and super quick to swap between them once done. I also setup a version filled with my back-up and Youth Players too. That way when the League Cup comes around I can instantly change my entire team without editing my neat and tidy 1st team setups.

This requires a bit of time investment up front, (10-15 mins max) and you may have to tweak the personnel on the fly if your pre-selected players are suspended or injured. But over the long haul (which is why we all play Career Mode after all) the time spent pays itself back many times over. 
Be specific when scouting
The scouting system in Career Mode is far from perfect, but if you can find the right balance with your search criteria you can find some genuinely great players you may have either forgotten existed, or didn’t know about at all. The only issue is finding the right balance because it’s very east to be too open (i.e. searching for a promising striker) and then getting flooded by search results containing every young striker in existence.
Tuning out the crap takes a bit of work but if you search off three criteria you’ll normally get closer to your mark. So if you’re looking for a Striker, try and include two other criteria from the right hand column; Pacey, Prolific, Promising, Tall, etc. It’s not an exact science but if you play around with the options can be zero in on niche players quite easily.
Also, don’t forget if you have a known player you want to find you can search for them manually by name and save yourself the hassle. But, I’d advise using both features as a hidden gem may just appear.
Other tips
•   Don’t neglect Board Objectives. Some will need to be managed all season long, so keep checking up of your progress if you want to keep your job. 
•   If you don’t wish to see the new Transfer Negotiation cut scenes every time you do a deal, you can delegate negotiate via a member of staff to keep things more like FIFA 17. 
•   If players are moaning about lack of playing time you can just ignore them. Don’t feel you have to act on every single request. 
•   Check on young talented Free Agents as soon as the mode starts. If you can pick up a player on a free, train them a bit and then sell them on, it’s all profit.
•   If you’re struggling with the match grind, you can Sim matches as you see fit. 
Oh, and don’t forget to buy low, sell high.

The EA SPORTS production team continued releasing their daily dose of FIFA 18 ratings throughout the weekend by posting the game's Top 20-11 players. 
Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann and cross-town Real Madrid rival Luka Modric both received +1 rating spikes. Modric's Los Blancos teammate Gareth Bale wasn't so lucky. The Welshman saw his overall rating fall by one. 
Juventus living legends Giorgio Chiellini and Gianluigi Buffon were not cursed by their age and saw their ratings improve by one.
Premier League favorites Thiabaut Courtois, Sergio Aguero and David De Gea's ratings remained leveled while Kevin De Bruyne and Alexis Sanchez's increased by one. 
Sanchez grew from an 88 to an 89 and received a position change from striker to left midfielder.
As always, make sure to keep a close eye on Futhead over the next few weeks as we post the latest FIFA 18 ratings as they are released."

UPDATE: Looks like the web app's now been pushed back to Thursday, September 21.

According to the official Electronic Arts website, we're just over a week away from the FIFA 18 Web App launching. 

September 15 – FUT 17 Web App goes offline.
September 20 – FUT 18 Web App comes online. If you’re eligible, this is when you can start using the Transfer Market.
September 21 – New Companion App launches. This is your chance to update your Companion App for FIFA 18 on Android and iOS.
Early access to the Web and Companion Transfer Market ends at 12:00 a.m. GMT on October 9. After that, you’ll need to log in to FUT 18 on your console or PC at least once to continue using both apps. 

While this schedule hasn't been announced through an social media accounts, it's clearly stated on the website with the FIFA 17 Web App slated to go offline on Friday. Five days later on Wednesday, September 20 is when the new Web App is set to be released. Also on the day, the EA Access trial is set to begin for FIFA 18. This makes sense with Squad Building Challenges available to be completed in the actual app this year. A day later, the companion app will apparently be updated and ready for FIFA 18. 

You must have created a FUT Club before August 1, 2017, to get early access to the FUT 18 Web and Companion apps.
Your FUT 17 account must still exist.
Your account needs to be in good standing. If you were banned or had other actions taken on your account in FUT 17, you won’t get early access.

Now that it appears to be official, what are your plans for the launch of FUT 18? Will you be trading first or building your starter squad? Let us know in the comments."

Market Overview
Picking up from last week, it seemed this one began as a calm before the storm for the Ultimate Team market. Early days saw prices stabilize and begin to climb; however, with the massive TOTY announcement and free pack (for those impacted by a brief period during which Prime Icons were not in packs at they should've been) surprise, the market has begun to turn negative. 
The increased supply and uncertainty of the two previous events, coupled with pack promos on the horizon, means prices should be faltering for the next few days. So, keep that in mind if you plan to buy your teams!
Focusing on the Path to Glory market, prices followed the market with a brief rise to begin the week. Yet, as the week closed the prices took polar directions for a lot of players. Elite PTG items saw bigger hits as players began liquidating, while the lower value players appreciated as some looked to bolster a few investments.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  Pretty tame price ranges between players highs/lows, but it seems Rashford and Coman had the largest differences. Might speak to their hype potential though...
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take:  Just like highs/lows the fluctuation stayed similar relative to their prices. That being said William Carvalho, Asensio and Stephan El Shaarawy could be profitable if you can buy at the right times.
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of a card to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Unlike the two previous stats, beta had some more extreme figures. Players like Renato Sanches, Lars Stindl and Joe Hart all showed high values which means they could be poised for big gains, but at a higher risk.
TOTW Shout 
Again a week with no strong Team of the Week contenders. Stay patient with the return of French and German football. 
Big Winner- Divock Origi (Wolfsburg)
After weeks of quiet, Divock Origi has benefited from the excitement of the Bundesliga returning. The fact that he already has an inform and gets solid minutes means the Beligan is an attractive item. 
A sizable weekly return of 14% means there is definitely value here, but it is important to note that his volatility (~2000) and beta (0.02) were quite low. Now that is interesting because it is a testament to how his rise has been steady rather that soley hype driven. 
The risk those two stats convey is low for his card, so look out for the ex-Liverpool man as profit could be here. 
Big Loser- Marquinhos (PSG)
Interestingly, it is Marquinhos’s second time as a Big Loser even though he seems a solid PTG option. He gets quality minutes for a team that bosses their league and has extremely practical links to OP players in FUT. So let's discuss why:
A whopping -20.9% percent weekly return cannot be ignored, yet just like Origi, the Brazilian defender had low volatility (~3250) and a mild beta (0.45). It speaks to the steady decline of this item over the past few weeks, but he is still a lower risk option. 
Make sure to take note of when the PSG defender begins to steady at the bottom as he is now more affordable and could be a nice value investment
Recap
To wrap it up, the big TOTY announcement and corresponding uncertainty led to lower prices after a week of small returns. It seems some investors are banking on PTG players being needed for SBC requirements at some point. Regardless of that, the return of football for a lot of these players means PTG should be seeing some more news soon.

Market Overview
Ratings Refresh is upon us, and at the perfect time too, as it seems we've all needed something fresh. Although there have been a couple noteworthy inconsistencies, EA’s large scale ratings rehaul has given the FUT market some overdue hype. On another front, as February comes to an end, so does the FUT Champs qualifying month which leads us to believe that “elite” players prices will drop due to a sizable influx of supply from high-caliber players selling on their super teams. That means you might be able to find some sweet deals on items in that bracket, but expect low/middle tier players to follow their normal price trend. 
Honing in on the Path to Glory market, this sector of FUT received quite a lot of upgrade hype meaning many items received some positive price shocks. Also, it is important to note that majority of the PTG players finally seem to be leveling out after some serious declines which is always nice for investors wanting to find a bottom to the market. Still a lot of risk around players, if you play your cards right that could lead to a lot of reward.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  As expected, most of the  high/low differences this week are attributed to the players with an upgrade shout; however, the more insightful differences belong to non-upgrade potential players. The likes of Alex Oxlade Chamberlain, Raphael Varane and Tiemoue Bakayoko sport decently sized high/low spreads, which means if PTG items get hyped in any way they could shoot up to their high price points.
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take: This week we’re going to examine an interesting take on volatility. Instead of looking at the large figures (again attributed to upgrade candidates) we’ll be looking at low figures on the likes of Lars Stindl and Emil Forsberg. These items present the best options for investors that want to speculate on PTG items being needed for an SBC in the future. Their low volatility figures suggest their price is stable, and shouldn’t lose much value over the next few weeks.  

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of a card to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Another really diverse week in beta figures across PTG items, but the most notable figures belong to Benedikt Howedes and Marquinhos. Besides both being CBs, these two items’ prices have been holding steady for a long time. Could we be seeing them shot up soon, or is it just a minor blip? Marquinhos has a shot at the former with his upgrade, while Howedes is most likely the latter. 
TOTW & Upgrade Shout 
 Not a big week for TOTW shouts, but a huge week for PTG upgrades!  Marquinhos, Marcus Rashford, Leroy Sane and Stephen El Shaarawy all received positive rathing refreshes. Kingsley Coman and Rodrigo still have upgrade potential, while Dimitri Payet narrowly missed out.

Big Winner -  Saul  (Atletico Madrid) 
Last week Marco Asensio claimed this spot, but this week we travel to their crosstown rivals, where Saul steals the show. After a quality performance over the weekend, Saul seems to have gained some serious traction, and although he was never poised for an Inform, he’s our biggest winner. 
Interestingly, Saul crushed it this week with a 21.7% return! In a week that was pretty tame besides upgrades that’s no small feat, and we want to unpack it. An assist definitely deserves a little credit, and their may be a slight upgrade chance, but the real reason is probably low supply due to age. Individuals may be hoarding this items, and since there usually isn’t more than 20 of him on the market at a time he is listed at a premium.
An important question to ask is Saul price sustainable at the moment? We believe hovering around 70k is not a desirable price for the midfielder; however, if his price dips back down he has clearly demonstrated hype potential and could warrant an investment if you’re looking to diversify.

Big Loser - Javier Pastore (PSG)
A tough blow to Paris Saint-Germain with Neymar’s injury news only gets worse as Javier Pastore finds himself as our biggest loser. A rough weekly return of -11.3% isn’t the worst figure this week, but the others are recovering TOTW items, and a Liverpool player we’ve already highlighted. 
Looking at his weekly stats, the ex-Palermo midfielder carries middle/low range volatility (2,000) and beta figures (0.27). These reflect that Pastore’s drop was somewhat gradual over the week, but also demonstrate that risk going forward is pretty low. With the amount of fixtures PSG has left there is still a chance for the Argentine to make his mark again, but if a few weeks go by without a quality performance his time will be up.

. 
Recap
With Ratings Refresh spicing up the game right before what should be a jammed pack March (Saint Patrick’s Day & FUT Birthday) the FUT market should be poised for some big price swings. At the moment its in a slight lull, but upgrades to players have bumped up prices on certain PTG items. Looking at the Path to Glory sector as a whole, most players look to have settled on a price, but minor declines are to be expected going forward.               

We'd love to hear any of your tinfoil hat predictions on how these Path to Glory items could be used in FUT, so drop them in the comments below!

One of the most anticipated parts of a FIFA launch is upon us: arguing about the new player items' designs.
With this year's FUT looking to be more of a polish-year than a sea change new feature laden one, in-game content is going to be paramount to keep FIFA's most popular game mode feeling fresh. It also happens to be a World Cup release cycle.
For the third straight FIFA, we've got plenty of item designs that should generate equal parts hype and debate: what's this item going to be for? When will these come out? Will Scream items contain the same short-term OP boosts FUT 17's did?
While we're busy arguing about what they all mean and when they might drop, we can all certainly take time to appreciate some of the cleaner designs we've seen in recent Ultimate Team releases.
All of the usual suspects are here: International Man of the Match, FUT Birthday, FUT Champions Items, FUTTIES, Team of the Group Stage/Knockout Round, Scream Team, MOTM, Heroes, Record Breakers, SBCs, St. Patrick's Day, TOTS, and Team of the Year. And then a few curious ones we're not even sure about yet. Could they be World Cup related release? We'll have to wait and see.
Let us know in the comments below or on social media which FUT 18 item designs are your favorite."

Back to back 4/4 Marquee Matchup Predictions have us feeling good. With most big European seasons done, it was nice to end on a bang considering we are now entering a minefield. Looking ahead, there will be plenty of “Rest of World” league picks that will be complicated with the likes of World Cup fixtures. So, strap in and let’s get these (primarily international) predictions going:
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to be selected:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
France vs Italy
Match Info: Kicking it off this week is a historic international rivalry, and although it is unfortunate that Italy is missing out on the World Cup, they have a good shout of making the next Marquee Matchups SBC. Plenty of non-rares to go around, but focus on players who have easy links between these nations.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Belgium vs Portugal
Match Info:  There are a lot of seemingly mix and match international fixtures in this cycle, but these two nations represent two very high profile sides. With a lack of apparent derbies, we think EA will turn to these two powerhouses to dish out a decent pack reward. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


England vs Nigeria
Match Info: This fixture sees two nations with a long history square off in preparation for the World Cup. With both teams reving up for Russia, this fixture should actually be quite entertaining. Another tie with lots of non-rares who can link relatively easily.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Sweden vs Denmark
Match Info: Rounding off our main picks, we travel to Scandinavia where these two nations also begin their WC prep. These nations are just fringe enough to fulfill EA’s diversity, while also offering a decent amount of gold cards to link. We can’t see the requirements being too difficult, but still best to be ready just in case.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
There’s never four clear locks for Marquee Matchups, and we would not be doing our due diligence as investors if we didn’t consider additional fixtures. With already plenty of writing above, we’re going to keep this section short this week, and just hit you with the essentials: 
Iceland vs Norway
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Brazil vs Croatia
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Spain vs Switzerland
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Austria vs Germany
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
We are betting heavy on the international fixtures above; however, in the deep sleeper section anything goes. The MLS has two derbies that might tempt EA if they decide to throw some major curveballs.

New England vs NYCFC or Columbus vs Toronto
Recap
If you're new to Marquee Matchup investing take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team.

Despite appearing to narrowly lead for the third and final spot in the influencer/media/athlete FIFA 18 Team of the Year vote, Tottenham Hotspur (and England national team) star Harry Kane is a second time Premier League Player of the Month. 
Kane gets yet another higher powered Squad Buildling Challenge unlockable (and untradeable) special purple item with an accompanying loan version available for the next several weeks.
While some will undoubtedly be quick to speculate this means Kane won't make the final TOTY cut, keep in mind since the blue-and-black Team of the Year items are available in packs and traditionally only for a couple days during the course of the next week, the idea of having some overlap for a slightly cheaper (but untradeable) lower-rated item isn't inconceivable.
You can check out Kane's second POTM item in the Futhead database -- and potentially that TOTY, should it come to pass, probably early next week."

Market Overview
Quite an eventful week for the overall FUT market, as ""Ratings Refresh"", European MOTMs and a major Icon SBC gave the community some quality content. The preceding promos gave sizable price boosts to any upgraded items, or items required for an SBC; however, the general FUT market is at a lull. With the end of February marking the end of a qualifying month for elite players, especially in-forms and Icons, find themselves on the decline. Now, going forward the top tier players should continue to follow their trend of rising closer to Weekend League due to increased demand, but it won’t be nearly as strong, so if you see a tasty open bid for your dream player take it!
Moving to the focus of this article, the Ones to Watch Market had another polarizing week. Upgrade hype for some quality Summer OTW items meant a few players saw some pretty nice returns, yet the Winter OTW items still seem to be finding their price. It’s taking a little longer than expected, but it seems we are nearing a point where they could finally be bottoming out.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats



The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data that I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:   Although we’ve been saying Winter OTWs haven’t found their price yet, their high/low difference could be a great indicator of their hype potential. Most Winter items are at their lows, and Alexis Sanchez, Theo Walcott and Francis Coquelin all present cases of large high/low spreads, which give you an idea of where their prices can go into the hype.
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take:  There was some great diversity amongst volatility figures this week, which is nice for the wide spectrum of FUT traders. We are going to return to examining large numbers here, and players like Federico Bernardeschi, Corentin Tolisso and Henrikh Mkhitaryan stand out. These items carry risk, so be advised; however, look to items with high volatility to yield you good profit if you can pick up cheap on open bid.
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: A polar week for this metric. Some huge numbers for certain players, as well as tame figures for most means the section is tricky this week. Items like Gylfi Sigurdsson, Milot Rashica and Keita Diao have enormous figure that speak to their risk to reward ratio going forward. All the preceding players are priced low at the moment with high hype potential; however, it all hinges on them playing well in real life!

TOTW Shout
In terms of true Team of the Week shouts, Romelu Lukaku redeemed his Man of the Match snub, while Diego Costa was always a dark horse. Speaking of MOTMs, Michy Batshuayi continued his upgrade spree, while Douglas Costa, Ederson, Kyle Walker, and Morata all saw their OTWs refreshed.
In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner - Douglas Costa (Juventus) 
Summer items carried the overall OTW market this week, and after reviewing the weekly performance Douglas Costa stands out as our biggest winner. Upgrade hype and TOTW shouts boosted a lot of players’ price, and Douglas Costa rode this wave the best.
A strong weekly return of 43.9% means his investors are sitting pretty, but high volatility (~5,300) and beta (-2.75) demonstrate that the future is a little less clear for this item. His upgrade may have been a little unexpected leading to higher hype, yet that also means his price might fall faster and harder. 
A quality five-star star skiller is appreciated by most FUT players, ourselves included, but the ex-Bayern winger looks poised for a price drop. If he can bag a goal or two this weekend this will of course change, otherwise sell into the hype. 
Big Loser - Neymar (PSG) 
From one Brazilian winger to another, left-sided attackers seem to be taking over our in-depth analysis. This week, Neymar finds himself as our biggest loser due to a 250,000 coin price drop, coupled that with an injury leaving him sidelined for an unknown period of time. 
Even though the injury is the largest factor in his price decline, we wanted to cover our thoughts on whether to keep or sell. At this point in domestic seasons Neymar will return with a month left, best case. This does not leave much to be desired, and we’d sell now to use the coins to invest elsewhere in items with positive returns. There are plenty of solid substitutes for your side, and our recommendation is a conservative suggestion to help protect your coins.
Recap & outlook
A ton of promos from EA, led to this week being quite eventful in the overall FUT market. High rated players seem to be at an all-time low, so don’t be afraid to pick up your stretch card. Ones to Watch items are still holding their value, especially after some tidy upgrades, but the Winter versions have yet to gain traction. Hopefully, some quality weekend performance will change all that. Finally, here’s some quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Looking at general trends, picking up on open bid and selling overnight has been extremely profitable lately. So, find a player you’re comfortable with and get to work!    

-- OTW investors: If you like taking risk, Winter items are at some really low figures, but it also might be beneficial to bet of some elite OTWs who have been down on their luck lately (all big risk though).

Well, well, well, after a Premier League TOTS Prediction which surprisingly missed nine players, Aaron fired back this week for the La Liga TOTS contingent by missing just three. So great news for Aaron, but for me personally, I felt the La Liga side was a little Barca/Real/Atleti biased (as it can be) with very few spots left open for the rest of the league. Two of the spots awarded to players below, could have easilly gone elsewhere. 
Isco – CAM – Real Madrid
We start this TOTS Unpredictables with perhaps the most confusing of the bunch. Cases can certainly be made (to a degree) for Luis and Adan, but Isco? I don't think anyone really had him in the frame this year. Isco has played 20 league games this season, 9 of which were from the bench, and from those games he's produced 7 goals and 7 assists. He has no European goals to his name and just one in the Copa Del Rey. Isco is a fine player don't get me wrong, and his contribution to Real Madrid goes way beyond those core stats but this is still somewhat of a head scratcher versus the competition in this area of the pitch. 
Aaron's View: I had already included quite a lot of Madrid players which considering they look set to finish in third, could have been classed as too many already. Isco comes off the bench a lot for Real which suggested to me that he isn't really the main man. The inclusion of Modric wouldn’t have surprised me, but Isco has a little.
Filipe Luis – LB – Atletico Madrid
When Felipe Luis did play this season, he was great for Atletico Madrid averaging over four tackles per game and he is undoubtedly one of the best left backs in La Liga. However, having spent significant periods out injured this season managing just 19 appearances it's a bit of a surprise to see him make the TOTS. Especially with Lucas Hernandez included making Luis the second left back from the same club. Which I don’t think has ever happened before? Luis is a great fullback but this TOTS (again) is a stretch for me.
Aaron's View: I could have included the full Atletico defence but I had to narrow it down, and although Luis has been fantastic whilst playing, the fact he only played 19 matches seriously put me off, and I instead opted for those who played more.
Adan – GK –  Real Betis
One of only five players not from the big La Liga three comes in the form of Real Betis stopper Adan, who funnily enough has two assists to his name this season. Overall Real Betis have had a great season to secure European football and it was always likely someone from the team would make the TOTS. Again, it’s a question of should it be Adan? Who has been good, but with Real Betis conceding as a team 58 goals (the joint 4th worst in the league) it’s yet again hard to see how he was selected.
Aaron's View: I was so confident on the two keepers I selected that I didn’t even contemplate the possibility of a third. That being said, I would have almost certainly gone for Asenjo had I selected another. Betis have done superbly to finish as high as 6th/5th in the table though, and fully deserved to be recognised in some way."

It's awfully hard to think about much beyond Team of the Year for the FIFA community at the moment.
That said, the show must go on, and with it, the Team of the Week that'll be available for the (presumed) first two days of TOTY is here.
The biggest immediate observation is the inclusion of Kalidou Koulibaly. The Napoli defender gets the nod after a rare high mark from Gazzetta -- he's ordinarily a WhoScored type darling but seldom particularly rated by the more traditional evaluatory systems. But he's also on the Team of the Year shortlist, so what does that mean if he inexplicably wins the EA or Community votes?
Our guess is, his TOTW item would probably still be safe, assuming defenders and goalkeepers don't go first like they did prior to last year. If they were in packs any days other than Monday and Tuesday, there'd be no conflict, and thus it wouldn't really matter if a member (no matter how improbable) of the TOTY had an in-form immediately before.
The big fish this week is of course none other than Real Madrid's Gareth Bale. With a spectacular 8.5 sofascore rating, his ubiquitousness on the pitch coupled with his usual class culminates in a 90-rated striker card you won't want to miss out on.
As per usual, here's the complete FIFA 18 Team of the Week 17:"

Saturday was qualification day for PlayStation players, as 16 players punched their tickets to London for the FIFA eWorld Cup grand final in August. Barcelona FUT Champions Cup runner-up Nicolas 'nicolas99fc' Villalba continued his dominance, having won 15 of his 16 matches in the competition; the Argentine seems honed in on finally attaching some silverware to his name after such a successful year.
Villalba began the day by facing his only other undefeated opponent, Spanish player JRA Lion. The two tied 2-2 in the first leg, but Nicolas edged his opponent by a 3-2 margin in the second. He then cruised to a 7-2 win over RB Leipzig's Cihan Yasarlar in the seventh round, and his 6-2 win over Lukas_1004 in the Round of 32 earned him a place in London.
Both of the Hashtag United players facing elimination from yesterday, 'Hashtag Agge' Rosenmeier and Ivan 'Hashtag Boras' Lapanje, clawed their way back to make the knockout rounds. Moreover, both qualified for London as well with exciting victories over notable competition. 
Boras, who has been unlucky at past tourneys despite strong showings, finally made his mark Saturday, beating Daniele 'IcePrinsipe' Paolucci in the Round of 32 in an epic 5-4 match. Despite falling down early, Boras regained his footing, only to see Prinsipe equalize with less than ten minutes left. However, a 118th-minute strike from Ruud Gullit spelled the end for Paolucci. Paolucci was all class after the gutting loss had him so close yet so far to the Grand Final:
An incredible year. A relentless adventure. Lived with you, following my journey, spur me every day more. But today I gave way to a great player and to even greater friend. Beautiful game @Hashtag_Boras pic.twitter.com/ELa0KuhwnM— Daniele Paolucci (@IcePrinsipe) June 2, 2018

Agge had to win both his matches to even qualify for the knockout rounds. He got off to a nervy start, losing his very first match, 1-2, to Turkish pro Isopowerr; he went on to win the second leg, 4-2. In the seventh round, he took care of business in the first leg itself with a 5-0 win. In the knockout rounds, Agge qualified for London with a 5-2 win over RB Leipzig's Cihan Yasarlar.
Without question, Saturday's Round of 32 was one of the most exciting rounds in the history of competitive FIFA. Seven of the 16 matches were decided by one goal, and most of them were shootouts; the lowest scoring match, between Philipp 'Eisvogel' Schermer and Lev 'Ajax Lev' Vinken, was still a very exciting 4-3 affair.
FC Basel's Tim 'FCB TheStrxngeR' Katnawatos downed his teammate Florian 'CodyDerFinisher' Müller, 6-4, to set up a showdown with Mo Aubameyang, who won a tight one over Japanese pro 'Curl,' 5-3. Damie, a player who signed with Roma just days before this tournament, advanced to London with a 7-6 win over Aaygun96; he will play MaestroSquad, who won 8-7 over Famsinho10.
Manchester City's Marcus 'Marcuzo' Jørgensen will play the Spaniard AndoniiPM in the Round of 16, coincidentally the same player that eliminated the Dane in knockout rounds in Manchester back in April. Jørgensen enjoyed a comfortable 7-1 win over Envy Jas, the largest margin of victory in the entire round, while Andonii played one of the more exciting matches, beating FifaUstun, who had scored 73 goals in 19 matches, 8-7.
Notable exits from this round of the competition obviously include JRA Lion, who started the day undefeated. 'IcePrinsipe,' the Italian player who beat Spencer 'FaZe Gorilla' Ealing the Madrid Regional Final last May, will also not feature in London. RB Leipzig's Cihan Yasarlar, the runner-up in the Paris Regional Final, was knocked out by Hashtag Agge and sees his 2018 run end here as well.
The broadcast crew will be back Sunday morning at 6 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UK time) for the rest of the knockout stages, including the PlayStation 4 grand final.

It's no surprise that six time consecutive Bundesliga champions Bayern Munch are well represented in the Bundesliga Team of the Season, but just looking at the five (!) highest rated starters in the side, and you're not going to find anyone from any other clubs.
The bench and reserves have more love to go around, with Marco Reus, he of just eleven league games this season due to another injury dominated campaign, somehow gets one of the most overpowered player items we're likely to see this FIFA TOTS. Timo Werner's 95 overall (98 Pace and 95 Shooting to boot) looks to be quite the item as well.
While many probably expected the buzz and excitement to fall off a cliff at the culmination of the Premier League and La Liga Santander Teams of the Season, the spiked ratings on items like Joshua Kimmich's and Leon Bailey's makes it certain Germany's top league's TOTS will get its moment as the hype epicenter of the FIFA Ultimate Team universe.

With many fans hoping to see former FUT staples like Hulk, Oscar, Jackson Martinez, Fredy Guarin, Ramires, and many others back in Ultimate Team, they’ll likely be waiting at least another year.
FIFA 18 is not expected to include the Chinese Super League when it releases later this Fall. According to a report by Fox Sports Italy, FIFA gameplay producer Sam Rivera states that there isn’t enough time to secure licensing from the league where more and more big name players are heading to every transfer window.
Recent rumors link Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to China as well, which could take away another heavily used FUT card in FIFA 18. It remains to be seen if EA Sports will be able to secure licenses for these players for national team use.
Curiously, the report also touched on so-called ""momentum"". Creative director Matt Prior attributed the chaos that sometimes occurs at the end of games to algorithms and stats rather than ""plot"". That answer probably won't sate the more conspiracy minded, but it's interesting to see the subject addressed on the record again."

Today, we'll be looking at the End of an Era SBC Totti item. The Roma Captain (""Il Capitano"") received this 96-rated SBC item to commemorate his 25 years with Roma, making 786 appearances and scoring 307 goals.

In-game stats and rating
Totti remains the only player to have appeared in every iteration of the FIFA franchise, and he's signing off with a bang. This item has some of the most impressive item and in-game stat in FUT 17. He has 99 acceleration, shot power, long shots, volleys, penalties, vision, short passing and ball control, with 98 dribbling and strength (as well as other 90+ stats).

His in-game ratings, without any chemistry styles, are also just ridiculous.

I used the Engine chemistry style on him, boosting his pace, dribbling and passing.
Squad
I used the loan version of the item in the following team: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7228760/

Which is switched around in game to look like this:

Stats
I used the item for 5 games, all in the Weekend League, and I didn't lose any of them. Here are Totti's stats for me:
Price: Loan (cost around 6K total on Xbox One)
Games: 5
Goals: 5
Assists: 3
Chemistry style: Engine
Let's get into the review.
Review
Unlike my other reviews, I won't be splitting this into pros and cons. This is because despite his numerous pros, his cons ruin the item for me.
First big one is his stamina. He's useless after the 50-60th minute. He can't play a high pressure style game, because that kills him by half-time. He's awful in the second half of games -- unable to press defenders, close down on opportunities, chase loose balls, or break through the back line. I know what you're thinking -- how is he in the first 50-60 minutes? He's incredible, and we'll get to that in a bit. But you're not paying 300K (plus high-rated untradeables) for a 45-minute player. His stamina ruins this item -- why EA can't/didn't put this stats in the 80s or 90s, we'll never know.
The second is his agility. It's bloody awful. It's made worse by his balance, which is also awful. Sure, he's good on the ball -- first touch is solid, ball control is perfect -- but he's still on the ball, hard to turn with, and impossible to rely on to wriggle out of tough situations. Even if you can manage without the stamina (which you won't be able to), this is a bitter pill to swallow. It's a real shame that these stats are so low, because it means that he will never live up to his dribbling stat on the item.
The third is one that actually makes me angry; the other two frustrate me, but this makes me angry. You look at his 89 pace, and you think it's enough, but that figure is huge deceptive. He has 99 acceleration, and 79 sprint speed. What does this mean? It means he will burst away from a defender, reach his not-so-great top speed, and be caught up with instantly. He's not slow, don't get me wrong, but he's no where near 89 pace. Feels exactly like his sprint speed, which is 79. The acceleration gives him an initial burst, but nothing beyond that.
The fourth issue is the lack of four-star skills. It's so limiting to have an attacking player with three-star skills, because it cuts down your options when you are under pressure. With his already lackluster agility and balance, not so great sprint speed, and the fact he's usually too tired to run away from defenders, those skills would have made a huge difference. However, this isn't so much a dealbreaker as it is a minor inconvenience.
This item has it's pros too -- his shooting is unreal, and possibly one of the best in the game. Long shots are effortless, and threaten the keeper from any angle, on either foot. His finishing is perfect, once again from any angle, with any kind of shot, and from either foot. He hit the woodwork six (6!) times in the five games I used him. His strength boost is incredible too -- he can muscle off defenders with ease in the first half, but it fades in the second half. His passing is unreal, and maybe the best I've used this year. Once again, his five-star weak foot allows him to pull of ridiculous passes with either foot, and they almost always find the target. At the end of the day, he got me 8 goal contributions in five games, so he's clearly doing something right.
Summary
He's a fantastic item -- a truly elite attacker and midfielder, with the crucial 5-star weak foot. But this item has major, major issues.
Don't get me wrong; I wanted to love this item. I have loved Totti since I was five years old, and I've even been to see an AS Roma game with my family. I grew up with his posters on my wall, his shirt on my back, and his name in my heart. For me, he will always be the greatest player to ever play for the Giallorossi, he will always be Il Capitano, and he will always be one of the greatest players I've ever watched.
But this item is not that -- this item is just a spectre of what Totti was.
Sure, EA have massively boosted some stats, and restored his shooting, passing and pace to what it should be (I still think his pace should have been done a little differently, with slightly lower acceleration, but much more sprint speed), but they have butchered his other stats. His stamina, agility, balance and sprint speed are item-killers, and they really ruin this item. In their defense, it is not entirely their fault. Throughout his career, Totti always brought something to the table that cannot be quantified into stats -- his heart, his tenacity, and his love for Roma and the beautiful game. And if and when his skills failed him, he always fell back onto those. But in a game, when his skills fail him, there is nothing to stop his fall.
All that being said, if you are thinking of getting him, I highly recommend trying his loan item. It's a joy to use, at least for the first 45-60 minutes of a game. If he clicks for you, if you feel the magic that Totti has brought to the table throughout his career, then get his SBC item. I personally will not be getting it, and instead keeping this expired loan item for the rest of the year.
Rating: 8/10 (10/10 for the first 45-60 minutes, 4/10 for the rest of the game)
Value for coins: 10/10 (Loan), 5/10 (SBC)"

Having lost their Champions League and Europa League rights, Pro Evolution Soccer (aka PES) announced Wednesday afternoon that they had entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Russia's top domestic league, the Russian Premier League. As a result, the full league won't feature in EA's next full title release, ""FIFA 19"". 
It remains to be seen if big clubs like FC Zenit Saint Petersburg will still be able to enter into their own club specific agreements with EA for the title.
The RPL's been a staple in recent FIFA's (particularly Ultimate Team), with its best and brightest usually headlining the Teams of the Week during the offseasons of the ""Big 5"" domestic leagues in Europe. 
Without the likes of Hulk, a long time FUT favorite, who departed for China, the league hasn't showcased in quite as many squads as we'd seen in recent years. Still, the league included the Russian national team's standouts and players like Dutch midfielder Quincy Promes regularly became almost cult heroes for their Ultimate Team special items.
Though few are likely to switch titles outright as a result of a licensing change like this one, it's always a bummer to lose content as opposed to gaining it. Many would probably very willingly take a UCL/EL for Russian League swap, but it's still possible we see some additional licensing agreements announced for next fall's game yet."

Last week's score: 15/18
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad Link: https://www.futhead.com/18/squads/3369005/


Goalkeeper
Beto - GK - OVR 76
It's very rare that I will predict both keepers during an international break but I do feel like there is a chance of that happening here. The first keeper selected is Beto after his saves resulted in a clean sheet during Portugal's 0-0 away draw with Belgium. He was awarded Man of the Match, and in a week with minimal options, that should go a long way.
Defenders
Martin Hinteregger - CB - OVR 77
We start off the defense with the first of a trio which although conceded I feel did enough to earn a selection in the side. Hinteregger managed to score one of two Austrian goals as they shocked Germany with a 2-1 win. His performance earned him multiple headlines after what was a superb goal by the CB.
Gary Cahill - CB - OVR 84
Although it was far from convincing, the fact that England won their game against Nigeria is likely to result in an IF and that player is an obvious selection in Cahill. The defender scored one of those two goals and by doing so picked up the official MOTM award.
Samuel Umtiti - CB - OVR 83
With France v Italy being one of the bigger games played this week, I can't see EA overlooking it. France came away with a convincing 3-1 win, but there was no stand out performances. With Umtiti scoring one of the three goals, alongside a recent TOTS snub, I feel as though that will be the route EA take.
Midfielders
Andriy Yarmolenko - LM - OVR 81
The first of two Ukrainian players I have selected in the side is Yarmolenko, who is also the stronger of the two options. The Dortmund winger was involved in all four Ukraine goals, scoring two and assisting two in a 4-1 win over Albania.
Yevhen Konoplyanka - RM - OVR 79
Continuing the theme of Ukraine, we move onto Konoplyanka, who was on the other wing. Although not as convincing as his teammate his brace should be enough to allow two Ukrainians into the side with options being few and far between.
Andre Carrillo - RM - OVR 77
This one was a little more difficult to find information on and thus the assist could easily be overlooked when selecting the side. EA have been good in recent times with the international fixtures though and thus I am more than happy to go with Carrillo who picked up a goal and assist in Peru's 3-0 win against Saudi Arabia.
Joel Campbell - RM - OVR 77
Although it’s safe to say that Costa Rica won't come close to the level of that they managed four years ago now they will be hoping to cause some damage. A convincing 3-0 win over Northern Ireland is what they managed in a warm up game with the usual threat of Joel Campbell doing the damage with both a goal and assist.
Edin Visca - RW - OVR 79
Visca has made a name for himself in the Turkish league this season, consistently performing to a high level. He has now taken that form to an international level for Bosnia, scoring all three of their goals in a 3-1 win over South Korea.
Forwards
Josef Alexander Martinez - ST - OVR 78
I can only imagine what Martinez's MLS All-Star item is going to look like with all these upgrades he has already picked up. Another hat trick from the Venezuelan which will probably result in him picking up his third IF of the season alongside a tasty 86 rating. Although the side is going to be dominated by international fixtures I believe the MLS will still feature.
Joshua King - ST - OVR 77
Although a player with as little game time as King rarely manages to make the eventual cut with the lack of striker options available his impact appearance off the bch could be all that is needed. Norway managed to snatch the win over Iceland late on, mainly thanks to King. The Bournemouth man ended with both a goal and assist.
Substitutes
Wayne Hennessey - GK - OVR 74
The international games never fail to give goalkeeper dilemmas and although this was different Hennessey's performance made things easier despite not being gold and coming during a mid-week fixture. The Welsh stopper made a total of nine saves in their 0-0 draw with Mexico.
Ryan Hollingshead - RB - OVR 66
Although EA could easily go back to a squad of 23 this week I do not expect them to keep switching between the two and thus come Wednesday I only expect the 18 players to be announced. As for the gold and silver ratio I also expect that to be much more lenient now and thus I have selected Hollingshead as the sub defender. The Dallas fullback scored one, assisted another and made a clearance off the line in a hard fought 3-2 win over LA Galaxy.
Robbie Benson - CM - OVR 62
Talking of weaker options, we now head over to the Irish league from which we find the usual suspects in Dundalk throwing some IF options our way. The best of the bunch is Benson after he scored twice and assisted another in a 5-2 win.
Matthew Leckie - RW - OVR 72
Although it was only a friendly Australia's 4-0 win away to Czech Republic is not something you can just shrug off. Not many expect them to do well in the summer but this result will help their confidence going forward. Leckie scored two of those four goals from the wing and thus makes my side.
Paolo Bartolomei - CM - OVR 00
Cittadella progressed with the scores level at 2-2 after extra time thanks to some bizarre rules in Calcio B's playoff system but regardless of that Bartolomei was the player who allowed them to do that scoring both of their goals, one of which was a freekick. Could well be a hero item.
Arber Zeneli - LM - OVR 73
It's been a short history for Kosovo but after recording their 4th consecutive win they have already proven that they are taking things seriously. The latest win came over a decent Albania side with a 3-0 win. Zeneli scored two of those goals from the wing and makes my side in the process.
Alvaro - ST - OVR 67
I could have quite easily just not selected a substitute striker but I felt like that would have been unrealistic and thus we have Alvaro after he scored twice for Alcorcon in a 3-0 win. Gama is also an option from the same match but we needed a striker to round the side out."

It'd been thought this might be the last FIFA Mobile Player of the Month. With the game reaching a bit of a twilight stage before either new programs or perhaps a revamp of sorts, it only makes sense to make either the last (or second or third to last) POTM really bring the heat.
Mission accomplished.
Manchester United (and former earlier-in-the-game's-life-cycle cult hero) Eric Bailly takes the honors this month and instantly surpasses the first month's winner, Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos, as the premier non-overall boosting CB in the game. Besides undoubtedly being a monster in-game -- 100 acceleration; how is that even fair? -- the item's +3 MRK and +2 TAC boosts make him a must for premier defenses.
While we'll have to wait and see what September brings, August certainly will be hard to top with this overpowered to say the least player item.
The August Player of the Month plan is available now."

The details surrounding the 2017 FUTTIES are finally here.
For the third year, EA SPORTS's FIFA 17 production team will unveil nominees of in-game-favorites, stars from the past game life cycle, and much more, but this time with a twist -- as previously speculated based on teases from social media, the voting will actually be conducted this time by completing Squad Building Challenges in-game.
Via EA:

Over the course of the six weeks, 30 players will be nominated across 10 categories and you will have the opportunity to vote for your favourite by completing their specific FUTTIES Nomination SBC. By completing the FUTTIES Nomination SBC, you will also receive a pink FUTTIES Nominee item with base stats of the player you voted for. 
The player with the most completed Nomination SBCs will win each category. Their FUTTIES Winner item will then be made available with boosted stats in a separate Winner SBC.
Completing the Winner SBC is the only way to get the Winner item, Nominee items DO NOT get an automatic upgrade.

Also worth knowing:

FUTTIES will run concurrently with ""Best of"" SBCs (which re-release some of the most popular SBCs released throughout this year's game) and Marquee Transfer SBCs, which will evidently unlock loan items of some of the bigger name summer transfers on their new clubs.
In a bit of a disappointment, unless particularly cheap, the Nominee SBCs evidently will have special pink items but no boosts. The winning items will feature boosted stats, but only be obtainable through later released FUTTIES Winner SBCs.
Are there any particular players you're hoping to see get nominated for FUTTIES this go around? Butland? Musa? Smalling? What's your fancy?"

Another week, another Versus Attack Mode season complete. And in what was the closest season finale yet, Din of 'Ukraine Top' edged out the ever-present Pang in the final match of the season (winning 11-5) to take the crown. The r/futmobile favourite quickly changed his team to put his own personal twist on the cTOTW, with some Ukrainian players for himself; the only Indian player who is in the game, and some sweaty options such as an old favourite in the form of Montreal Impact's pacey striker Dominic Oduro.
This week's Master player is Schalke's Ukrainian winger Yevgen Konoplyanka - a personal favourite if this week's winner. The 96 rated LM item will become the joint third best LM in the game, and with some excellent boosts of +1 SPD and +1 BAC, he provides a great opportunity to strengthen your team if you haven't got Martial yet, or are just wanting a solid and high rated upgrade to your team.
This marks the second of five cTOTW plans which you will need to complete in order to get the Player of the Month at the end of August, with August having five Thursdays in it, and with two excellent players so far, the POTM already has the potential to be a great player!

The addition of FUT Champions and the Weekend League seems to have made nearly every gold card in Ultimate Team worth something. In rare circumstances, even a lower-rated card can become worth a ton of coins. No item demonstrated this more than N'Golo Kante in FIFA 17. The 81-rated 'little engine that could' was a fixture in nearly every single Weekend League squad that was worth caring about or fearing. The demand for his card was so high that his price constantly remained high and often rose every week. 
Looking ahead to the launch of the FUT 18 market, we've begun to wonder which players could have the same type of effect on the market? Obviously every high-rated card in the game will be expensive to begin the game. But what about the lower-rated cards? Perhaps there a chance to hop on the wagon before it starts rolling downhill. Here are five underrated cards we could see have a Kante-like rise in price when the market hits full health when the game is launched: 
Leroy Sane - LW - Manchester City - 82
Assuming the cross-body shot is as good in the new FIFA as it was in the previous edition, Sane with a position change from RW to LW is a big deal. Couple that with his ratings boost and penchant for obtaining special cards and picking up him up as early as possible would be a smart move. For those unable to afford the Hazards and Sanchezs of the world, Sane will be right alongside Sadio Mane in the tier below and the German will have a little less hype surrounding him entering FIFA 18. 
Timo Werner - ST - RB Leipzig - 82
As with every FIFA ever, speed inevitably kills. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is the undisputed king of the Bundesliga speedsters. However, unless you've pre-ordered the special mega uber ultra edition that comes with a free 700,000 coins, you'll need an alternative. Timo Werner and his 91 pace will be extremely valuable to Weekend Leaguers looking to get off to a great start. Special cards are a certainty with Werner so investing him him early could pay off big time. 
Nelson Semedo - RB - Barcelona - 81
Ignore the overall rating. Nelson Semedo will be one of the best right backs in the game. Pace for days on the flanks with 80 dribbling to boot, he'll be the most sought after right back for anyone building a La Liga squad. His rare nation of Portgual could come in handy for hybrid squads as well. If you're looking for a card to pour money into in hopes of a Kante-like boom, Semedo might be your best bet. 
Mario Balotelli - ST - Nice - 82
Is Super Mario back? With the addition of Neymar to Ligue 1, we can expect to see the number of squads from the French league increase substantially. Edinson Cavani and Kylian Mbappe will be hugely sought after and very expensive. Who's a cheaper alternative sitting behind them? Mario Balotelli. A former FUT favorite, FIFA 17 saw him get his lowest rated card ... maybe ever. After a renaissance with OGC Nice, Balotelli is back and his card looks amazing. Expect the hype around him to be huge. Get him early before everyone gets on back on the Balotelli Bandwagon. 
Antonio Rudiger - CB - Chelsea - 82
Center backs are plentiful in almost all the top leagues. Options aren't necessarily good for investment opportunities. However, it's Antonio Rudiger's league/nation combination that make him a prime candidate to be in high demand. He'll be the default option for any Premier League/Bundesliga hybrid squad. In past years, the only options for the PL center back for such a team have been Per Mertesacker and Shkodran Mustafi, neither very good cards. Rudiger has the pace and physicality you want in a card. He'll be a fixture in the Weekend League, guaranteed."

One of the more news worthy FIFA patches arguably of this current game's entire lifecycle is upon us.
Live on PC now and imminent to Xbox One and PS4 (history would dictate their review and approval proceses should have it live by next week), this latest FIFA 18 patch addresses a number of the most vocally complained about elements from the community. 
It certainly doesn't fix everything everyone online's ever griped about regarding the game, but amongst what it tackles includes the so-called kickoff ""glitch"". While early game data didn't yield the same abnormal number of goals off kick that many of us have anecdotally experienced, FUT Champions channel displaying a number of high profile such quick strike goals could've necessitated a tweak, as we now we see in the patch's release notes (found below) that defensive shape and player behavior from these situations have been changed to minimize these sorts of incidents.
Perhaps similarly noteworthy, the issue of players dodging others in FUT Champions by either playing exclusively as the home team or backing out when you see certain kits is now a thing of the past. All FUT Champions players will be shown as the hometeam at the matchup screen and every game you play, you'll see your opponent wearing one of your two primary kits you're not wearing. This will essentially restrict custom kits to a Seasons/Single Player Online Match/Draft only vanity affair, but will tackle one of the more griped about aspects of selective matchmaking in the game's competitive mode.
Lost in the mix but certainly not insignificant to some, the new Squad Fitness search (long previously restricted to grouping single match items in with the squad ones) will soon be live in-game (finally), and some of the social media controversies related to traits showing up incorrectly during pause menus in-game will be addressed too.
You can read the full PC release notes of the latest FIFA patch below. Other than the goalkeepers auto-passing when passed to, it's not believed any other gameplay changes in this patch will be reflected in the build used in Barcelona in the first FUT Champions LAN event this coming weekend."

With the FIFA Mobile Global Tour in full swing -- make sure you vote for the Program Legend and enter Futhead's giveaway for your chance at one of three 99-overall beasts -- many predicted this week's 'Retro Stars' would be a bit of a snoozer.
Think again.
The popular Halloween Luiz Gustavo, now on his new club of Marseille (and at 91 overall), as well as Carniball Vincent Koziello (up to 94 overall in his own right) are joined by the upgraded 98 OVR Easter Thibaut Courtois to make for a pretty solid all things considered week of offerings. If you're like many, you may have to build the untradeable Courtois to have a shot at him. But at 98 overall, and with some not-too-shabby looking boosts, you could do a lot worse at GK -- especially if you skipped uTOTS Gigi Buffon and/or VsA Champion Jan Oblak.
While it doesn't have the spice of a 99-overall striker or center forward, a 98 goalkeeper will probably entice some of the medium-to-heavier spenders. And Gustavo could still make quite a few players' club.
Which of this week's 'Retro Stars' are you most excited about? Any players you're still hoping get a bump in future weeks?"

With all of the big leagues now reaching the end of the season, and World Cup preparation well and truly underway, Matchups has sadly come to an end for now.
We go out with a flurry though, with our last set of five games helping decide league titles, European competitors and relegation battles so it'll no doubt be a tough set to predict.
So, for the last time, let's get into the predictions.

Lyon v Nice
We start in France, with both Lyon and Nice both battling it out for a spot in different European competitions next season. 
A shock defeat to Strasbourg last weekend means that hosts Lyon, who currently sit third,need a win to guarantee that place, and Monaco to slip up against already relegated Troyes to finish above them. With Mariano out injured last week, they may be without him again this time round, but the in form trio of Fekir, Depay and Traore have more than enough goal scoring ability to make up for him. That loss to Strasbourg was their first dropped points in the league in for over two months so they are in fine form. Suspensions for Lopes and Marcelo may come back to haunt them, but reserve keeper Gorgelin proved his worth by keeping a clean sheet in their last home game, making their run of five consecutive clean sheets at home match the run they last managed 40 years ago. They are unbeaten in their last six games at home, winning five.
Nice will be hoping to keep in the Europa League places for next season, needing a win to be guaranteed sixth spot. With a two point lead over Bordeaux and St. Etienne, a point may be enough but both of them have far easier games than them, so a win seems to be the only real option for them. With both Balotelli and Favre rumoured to be going out the door soon, they will no doubt want to give their fans a good send off. In recent weeks they have struggled on the road, winning only two of their last 12 away from home.
Lyon came out on top when the two met back in November, cruising to a 5-0 win. However that was their first win against Nice in six games, with Nice triumphing three times. I feel like home advantage and form gives Lyon a big advantage this time around, so I'm going with them to win.
Game played: Saturday 19th, 8:00 p.m. (BST) / 3:00 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Lyon win

Lazio v Inter
Next we have a very tough game from Italy, with both teams hoping to qualify for next season's Champions League, and also the decider for the ‘Capocannoniere’ - the Italian golden boot award, which sees Lazio’s Immobile (29 goals) and Inter’s Icardi (28 goals).
Lazio have home and points advantage coming into the game, sitting three points ahead of Inter and a superior goal difference of +6. With the hope of also catching Roma in third, if they fail to beat Sassuolo, along with the prospect of finishing the season as the top scoring team in the league, they will be more than motivated to win in their last game at home this season. They are unbeaten in their last 10 league games, but with five draws in that run, they have slipped down to third in the league. Their home form in general this season hasn't been great, picking up just 32 points from 18 games so far, compared to 40 in 19 on the road. One big concern for the hosts is the fitness of their  partnership of Immobile and Luis Alberto, who have both been out injured in recent weeks and are in a race against time to be fit. The latest news I have seen suggest that Immobile will be available but Alberto will not.
Inter have had a solid season after last years disappointment of not even getting in the Europa League. They come into the game off the back of back-to-back 2-1 home defeats to Juventus and then Sassuolo, with a 4-0 away in between. With a fully fit squad, they will no doubt be hoping to capitalise on an injury hit opponent, and go for the win that would see them move ahead of their opponents due to a beating them in head-to-head this season, as head-to-head is used as a deciding factor ahead of goal difference in Calcio A.
When these two met back in December, they played out just their second draw in 22 games. Before that, they had three wins each, making it very tough to split between them. 
As expected this is a close one to call, with the fitness of Lazio’s front pair still unknown and no doubt playing a big part. If i had to pick a winner I'd say Inter, based on Lazio’s injury concerns, but I feel like a draw is pretty likely.
Game played: Sunday 20th, 7:45 p.m. (BST) / 2:45 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw

Villarreal v Real Madrid
Real Madrid are one of the few teams who you expect to win almost every game they play, and are a treat in Matchups. But this week may prove far more difficult than most with Los Blancos just one week away from the Champions League final.
After the draw between Betis and Sevilla last weekend, Villarreal are now guaranteed a spot in the Europa League next season, and are battling only for fifth and sixth with Betis. They are second in the form table for the last six games, behind Levante, and have had an average of over four goals for or against in each game of that run. A 5-1 thrashing at the hands of Barcelona is the only blip in a good run that has seen them keep ahead of a very strong and in form Betis team. 
Real ended a dreadful run, by their standards, of three games without a win by thrashing Celta Vigo 6-0 last weekend. And with just four wins from 10 in all competitions, they are maybe not as feared an opponent ad they were a few months ago. With the Champions League final so close, they may opt to rest the majority of their big name players to allow them to rest for that game. They are still in with an outside chance of finishing second, but need a favour from Eibar who face Atletico Madrid. 
Villarreal can come into the game with some hope given Real’s poor run of form, but Los Blancos will probably give the majority of their players some minutes, just to keep match fitness levels up. And with a certain Portuguese attacker now back in training, and desperate to play, Real look like they are favourites for the win.
Game played: Saturday 19th, 7:45 p.m. (BST) / 2:45 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Real Madrid win 

Alcorcon v Rayo Vallecano
We drop down a division now to try and predict a big game for two teams battling at opposite ends of the table. 
Hosts Alcorcon sit just three points outside the relegation zone, with this being their toughest game left this season. With no wins in their last six, they will almost certainly need to pick up some points to guarantee their place in the league for next season. Although their defence has been just as good as Vallecano, conceding 42 so far this season, they have struggled for goals and average 0.76 goals per game, with their 30 goals scored being the joint second worst in the league.
Rayo Vallecano are currently top of the league with three games left to play. They have been in good form recently, winning five in a row before a shock loss to relegation threatened Cordoba last weekend saw their advantage over Huesca halved. With only one loss in their last 12 away games, they are not scared of travelling, and a win this weekend will set them up well for the last two games of the season, knowing their fate is in their own hands. In Raul de Tomas they have the second top scorer in the league, and his fine form of 16 goals in 15 games has seen them move up from fourth at the winter break to the top of the league
Vallecano have been dominant in the past few years against Alcorcon, winning six of the last seven games between the two sides, conceding just two goals in that time. Vallecano’s superior form, head-to-head record  and league position all point to an away win, and I expect that to be the result and Vallecano to come away with the three points.
Game played: Sunday 20th, 5:0p p.m. (BST) / 12:00 a/p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Rayo Vallecano win

Fenerbahce v Konyaspor
The battle at the top of the Turkish league is probably the closest in Europe, with the top four separated by just four points going into the final game of the season. Galatasaray have a three point lead at the top of the table over Fenerbahce and Basaksehir, with Besiktas another point back and hoping for some favours from other teams to help them move into the Champions League playoff for finishing 2nd.
Fenerbahce have been fighting Galatasaray all the way, but their rivals have simply been too good to drop points recently.  A 7-0 win on Monday saw them move level on goal difference with Gala, but they are still three points behind going into the last game. They will be hoping to end their season on a high at home with a big win after losing the cup final last week, and a big win to earn them Champions League qualification will be the minimum expectation. Eight wins and a draw in their last nine league games is an excellent run of form that they they will be hoping to keep going for the last game.
Konyaspor won’t be spectators in this game, knowing that they need to avoid defeat to be sure of safety. They sit three points ahead of Osmanlispor, with a goal difference advantage of 7. Despite being pretty good at home this season, they have been horrendous away from home with just nine points in 16 away games. They have relied heavily on Macedonian striker Jahovic, who has scored 50% of their goals in the league, but he has been in pretty poor form of late with just two goals in his last seven games, adding to their struggle.
Konyaspor have proven difficult for Fenerbahce to beat recently, with one win and a draw in the last two matches. However, Fenerbahce won the three before that, keeping a clean sheet in each of those games. I feel like Fenerbahce are too good to lose this game, with their general form and Konyaspor’s poor away form makes the hosts big favourites in my eyes.
Game played: Saturday 19th, 5:00 p.m. (BST) / 12:00 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Fenerbahce win

Ligue 1 (and hey, the Championship we guess)'s return always meant there'd be some more familiar names in Team of the Week 47. Though it won't be until next week -- and with it the Premier League being back -- that we see TOTW anywhere near ""full strength"", but none the less, this week's is a welcome somewhat return to form.
American co-all-time goalscoring record holder Clint Dempsey gets a tasty 87-overall in-form and is joined by Italian/Russian League standout Domenico Criscito. The left back checks in at 84-overall this week. 87-overall Nabil Fekir highlights the L1's best and the transfer-rumored-but-never-materialized Gelson Martins gets an 83-overall right midfielder card.
Of note (we think): Congolese-Belgian right-sided midfielder Dodi Lukebakio isn't in the FIFA database -- or wasn't -- at the time of release, so you may not see his player item in Futhead immediately. EA now have the ability to add missing players to the datebase though historically have done them en masse rather than piecemeal. We'll stay tuned to what they do and add him as we're able.

Ed. note: A reminder that these are the opinions of this author and this author alone; there are more than one way to evaluate and determine if a player item is right for you and your squad. His methodology may not work for you or be perfectly aligned with how you'd approach grading an item, but you're always welcome to do so yourself in the Futhead Reviews section.
Today, we'll be looking at the 92-rated TOTS Heung-Min Son. After quite an impressive season, Son has received a TOTS card that harkens back to the days of 2POTM Son.

I used Son in this team angled more towards hardcores/competitive Weekend Leaguers:

I've only used him for a handful of games, but here are my stats after these games:
Price: 645,000
Games: 8
Goals: 16
Assists: 5
Chemistry Style: Marksman
Just like his cards in previous years, Son is incredibly well-rounded. He can run, shoot, pass, dribble, and even bully other players. Some of his key stats include:


96 Acceleration and 95 Sprint Speed


94 Positioning, Finishing and Shot Power


97 Long Shots


90 Agility


97 Dribbling


99 Heading


99 Stamina


79 Strength and 77 Aggression


Let's get into his item stats:
Pace: 10/10
He's lightning. Just start running, and he'll get away from anyone. I've seen this guy outpace even the fastest fullbacks, and do so with ease. He's especially effective when he runs in a straight line, as on an all-out sprint, he's uncatchable. My suggestion would be to do the quick one-twos, and send him between defenders, or send him barrelling down the line.
Shooting: 10/10
God-tier. He can score with any kind of shot, from any angle, from any range. Finesse shots are deadly, long shots are amongst the best I've seen this year, and he's incredibly clinical inside the area. Literally perfect.
Passing: 8/10
This is a strange one. In close- to medium-range passes, he's perfect. He can do all the link up play, all the crosses, and even most of the through balls. However, he's just not that great at long passing -- he can't ping it further than 30 yards, his long crosses are rarely on target, and his over the top through balls are often missplaced. However, if you play him as a striker, his passing is more than adequate.
Dribbling: 10/10
He's a lot of fun to dribble with. Perfect ball control and dribbling, with a flawless first touch, as well as the 4-star skills, makes him a joy to use. He can weave in and out of defenders with ease, and he's incredibly hard to dispossess.
Defending: 5/10
He can apply a lot of pressure to a backline, thanks to his pace and physicality, but don't expect him to win the ball back. His tackling is garbage, and he'll give the foul away more often than not. Stay away from using him at CM.
Physical: 10/10
This surprised me. His height and build in-game make him seem a lot stronger than his stats would suggest. He can hold off most defenders, and he bullies the weaker fullbacks and midfielders with ease. His strength and aggression feel like they are in the high 80s, and that makes him a nightmare the handle. He holds his own while dribbling, and can push back on defenders for just long enough to get a shot away. Also, his jumping (coupled with his heading accuracy) makes him a menace in the air.
Weak Foot: 10/10
Had to mention this, since it is the game-changer. His five-star weak foot is the highlight of the item, and it makes him truly unstoppable. You can't read him, you can't contain him, and you can't do anything when he starts shooting. He's genuinely ridiculous.
Overall Rating: 10/10
Value for Coins: 10/10
This item was better than NIF CR7 for me. In fact, this item is better than almost any attacking minded item I've tried this year, with the exception of TOTS Firmino and Prime R9. He's incredibly effective, and a lot of fun to use. I would 100% recommend."

We're through a full day of voting for our community-powered FIFA 18 Team of the Year vote. Over 30,000 strong of you have made your voices heard in helping shape who just might make it in the final TOTY. If you haven't voted so far, what are you waiting for?
The early returns aren't entirely dissimilar to what you'd expect: the biggest names are all there. There are a few surprises, however, and a couple positional competitions could still shake things up yet.
While we don't want to unfairly skew or electioneer a specific outcome for our ballot, since you the voters made this all possible, we want to make sure you have updates from now until our collective vote is finalized Thursday, January 11.
Below are the results so far, ordered alphabetically by positional group. As mentioned, a few positions are still very much in play. So if you have friends who haven't voted, make sure they head to the site to fix that ASAP. Their vote might ultimately be the one that gets that one player item you want in the ballot or not.

The FIFA team rounded out an exciting week of player ratings releases by dropping the game's Top 40-31 stars. Instead of the previous 20 per day releases, fans were given ten of the top 40 new player ratings.
Out of the lastest batch of releases, only two saw downgrades. Premier League midfielders Mesut Ozil and Paul Pogba suffered a -1 drop. Pogba still holds on to his vaunted five-star skills, at least.
Bayern's Arturo Vidal is the only player on the list to avoid a rating change, which keeps him at an 87 overall. His FCB teammate Jerome Boateng was not so lucky. A season of injuries saw him fall from a 90 to an 88 overall. 
Marcelo continued the overpowered Brazilian full back trend by increasing from an 86 to an 87. Paris Saint Germain's Edinson Cavani increased by one as well.
Premier League favorites Christian Eriksen and N'Golo Kante received sizable upgrades -- on paper. Eriksen increased by two while Kante jumped from an 83 overall to an 87. But Kante's total stats somehow increased by just three.
It's worth noting: How overall is calculated is tweaked annually, as is how it's calculated for certain positions. Kante's move to CDM on his base card alone could account for half of the overall increase. We'll have to wait and see which stats are most important in the game in a few more weeks.
As always, if you want to be up to date with the latest Player Ratings releases, make sure to keep a consistent eye on Futhead's ""latest players"" tab."

One thing was on the minds of every FIFA esports player competing in Amsterdam today: qualification for the Grand Final in London in August. To do that though, the Xbox One competitors had to first qualify for the knockout stages and then win a match. After Monday, 12 had already qualified to the do or die stage of the Netherlands-based tournament. But, 20 spots remained with 40 players still in the hunt.
The day started off with the last two rounds of the Swiss format group stages. Round 6's marquee matchup was between the two remaining undefeated players, Manchester FUT Champions Cup winner Aldossary 'Rogue Msdossary' Mosaad and 2017 FIFA Interactive World Cup champion Spencer ‘FaZe Gorilla’ Ealing. 
In addition to being big names in the circuit, both players came into today with a dominant 5-0 record. Due to the structure of the Swiss rounds, they were bound to face each other next, as they were the only two to have the same record. The two-leg affair lived up to the hype, as the heavyweights split the matches. However, Msdossary's 6-2 lead in the first leg was too much for Gorilla to overcome, even though he notched four goals in the second. The tie finished 9-6 in favor of the Saudi Arabian.
While this matchup left Msdossary as the only undefeated player, it set up a pivotal Round 7 matchup against Niklas 'Nraseck 7' Raseck, a German native who the Manchester winner had called his toughest opponent at the tournament, and the budding rivalry between the two gained even more traction Monday. The high-octane first leg ended 4-4, but Raseck blew Msdossary out of the water in the second with an assertive 5-1 win.
Two of the three Hashtag United players on the Xbox side of the competition, 'Hashtag Ryan' Pessoa and Adam 'Hashtag dreamR' Barton, went on to qualify for the knockouts, but 'Hashtag Harry' Hesketh saw a comeback attempt fall short early.
Crazy game. @HashtagHarry__ came back from 4-0 down to 4-4 but ultimately @WHU_Jamboo got the 6-4 win. Well done to him. Harry’s season is over but he will be back!!! — Spencer FC (@SpencerOwen) May 29, 2018

That being said, getting to the knockout stages was not the ultimate goal for the players today; it was to ensure qualification to the FIFA eWorld Cup grand final, held in London in August. A total of 32 competitors -- 16 from each console -- can qualify. And Tuesday's proceedings would end only after the final 16 for Xbox was set. The task at hand was fairly straightforward: qualify for the knockout stages, and win the first-round matchup.
The big names -- Rogue Msdossary, Nraseck 7, FaZe Gorilla -- all qualified with relative ease. Gorilla tallied an incredible 13 goals against Javier 'Janoz' Munoz, a well-heralded Colombian player. The Birmingham native will play the Canadian Nawid 'GoalMachine' Noorzai in the Round of 16, coincidentally the same player that knocked him out in Manchester. Kurt 'Kurt0411' Fenech and AFC Ajax's Dani Hagebeuk both qualified as well.
Donovan 'F2TeKkz' Hunt, the 16-year-old who wowed audiences by winning the Barcenlona FUT Champions Cup back in January, and Hashtag Ryan both made surprising exits in the first round. Hunt was outclassed by the French FIFA champion and Olympique de Marseille player Fouad 'Rafsou' Fares, 4-1. Ryan, on the other hand, lost a nailbiter to Fabio Denuzzo, an Italian newcomer. The Hashtag man's second-leg comeback took him to extra-time and came within seconds of penalties, but an Iniesta-esque heartbreaker in the dying minutes sent the Brit home.
The broadcast crew will be back Wednesday morning at 6 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UK time) for the rest of the knockout stages, including the Xbox One grand final.

Barcelona FUT Champions Cup runner-up Nicolas 'nicolas99fc' Villalba lead the way for PlayStation players Friday, as the second half of the EA Sports FIFA 18 Global Series Playoffs officially kicked off. Villalba was one of two players to finish the day with a perfect 5-0 record, the other being the Spanish player JRALion.
Similar to the Xbox One leg, 12 players qualified for the knockout rounds after day one, while another 12 were eliminated from the tournament; 40 players remain in the hunt with either 3-2 or 2-3 records, and they look to get those last one or two wins on Saturday.  Of the list of names to qualify, audiences are familiar with quite a few. 
Villalba only recently rose to notoreity, thanks to his runs in Barcelona and Manchester, where he lost out to eventual runner-up Philipp 'Eisvogel' Schermer. Nevertheless, the Argentine continued his rise, scoring 32 goals and only conceding 10 for a +22 goal difference through 10 matches. His most important win Friday came in the second leg against Manchester City's Marcus 'Marcuzo' Jørgensen; both players came into the tie with a 4-0 record and Marcuzo had even built a 2-1 lead in the first leg, however, a 5-0 thrashing reminded audiences to not get carried away just yet.
FC Basel's Tim ""FCB TheStrxngeR"" Katnawatos, who has always steadily performed well under the radar at these competitions, posted a 4-1 record. Both Hashtag United PlayStation players, 'Hashtag Agge' Rosenmeier and Ivan 'Hashtag Boras' Lapanje, are still in the mix with 2-3 and 3-2 records, respectively. Madrid Regional Final winner Daniele 'IcePrinsipe' Paolucci also finished 4-1, as did RB Leipzig's Cihan Yasarlar, who lost in the February 2017 Paris Regional Final to then-Hashtag United player Tassal 'FaZe Tass' Rushan.
Manchester City's other star, 2017 FIFA Interactive World Cup runner-up Kai 'Deto' Wollin, needs just one win from two on Saturday to ensure entry into the knockout round; Eisvogel remains in the same boat as well.
New York City FC's Christopher ""didychrislito"" Holly exited the competition early with a disappointing 0-4 record, failing to win any of his games. The other North Americans in the PlayStation division are faring better. The Mexican Gfinity USA player Joksan, put himself in good standing by advancing with a 4-1 record, while Reinhard 'rein10' Krause needs a perfect two wins from two tomorrow to qualify.
The broadcast crew will be back Saturday morning at 6 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UK time) for the final two rounds of the group stages. The knockout rounds will follow. For a more fleshed-out look at the entire weekend's schedule, you can go here. Extended coverage and behind-the-scenes action can be found on Twitch."

The EA SPORTS Production Team has continued to spoil us through the weekend by releasing FIFA 18's Top 30-21 Player Ratings.
Bayern Munich fans will appreciate the love as three of their stars saw upgrades. Mats Hummels and Arjen Robben grew by +1 while Thiago jumped from 85 to 88.
A Bayern rival, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang earned a +1 rating boost and retained his insane 96 overall pace. Fellow striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasn't so lucky. The aging Manchester United star saw both his rating and pace significantly drop. Ibrahimovic's overall fell by two while his pace decreased from 72 to 65.
Paris Saint Germain's Thiago Silva felt Zlatan's pain as his overall decreased by one, down to an 88. Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris saw his rating remain the same and so did Atletico Madrid's Diego Godin.
Newly signed AC Milan center back Leonardo Bonucci earned a plus one upgrade and former teammate Paulo Dybala grew by two. 
As always, make sure to keep a close eye on Futhead over the next few weeks as we post the latest FIFA 18 ratings as they are released."

A perfect 4/4 last week, and it took a pick from every section to do it. As we draw to the close of a lot of European leagues, games become increasingly important, while also giving us an influx of cup finals. These cup finals seem to take priority in the eyes of EA, so we have tailored our predictions accordingly going forward. With Team of the Season packs on the line let’s delve into this week’s predictions which feature a mix of domestic and international fixtures. 
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to be selected:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Real Madrid vs Liverpool
Match Info: With the Europa League just concluded, and the tie currently featuring the current Marquee Matchups it seems only natural that the UCL final will feature. This match is as high profile as it can get, but that also means prices will be at a premium, so get in early.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 80 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Fulham vs Aston Villa
Match Info:  We move to a playoff final in England which sees more than 100 million pounds on the line. Talking about money, make sure you’re putting your coins in the highest rated non-rares you can find. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


FC Zurich vs Young Boys
Match Info: In Switzerland, a cup final connects back to what I said earlier about them taking prioritizes in the eyes of EA. A low profile league also allows this pick to provide nice diversity for EA, so this tie is one of our favorites this week. Make sure to be picking up the highest rated you can, yet keep it as close to discard as possible.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


LA Galaxy vs San Jose
Match Info: Not a cup final or playoff; however, the MLS will be carrying the Marquee Matchups going forward. This California Derby should actually be a solid matchup, and would be another nice fringe selection for EA. Try to stay close to discard price here, which should not be too hard considering its low profile at the moment. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
There’s never four clear locks for Marquee Matchups, and we would not be doing our due diligence as investors if we didn’t consider additional fixtures. With already plenty of writing above, we’re going to keep this section short this week, and just hit you with the essentials: 
Bohemians vs Shamrock
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 68 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Rosenborg vs Brann
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 68 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


France vs Ireland
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Mexico vs Wales
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
We finally hit one of these last week. A Polish league match coming through, and maybe we can get as lucky with Norway. A derby highlights their matchweek, and this might just be weird enough. 

Valerenga vs Lillestrom
Recap
If you're new to Marquee Matchup investing take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team. 
With plenty of big games to choose from we would love to hear your picks below! Also, feel free to share your thoughts on any games we missed."

The big controversy of the weekend, pro player Kurt 'Kurt0411' Fenech's behavior in the wake of an apparent ""kickoff goal"" that culminated in his team's elimination from the semifinals of the 2018 FIFA Club eWorld Cup, was all the rage on social media. Was Kurt being a Spartacus figure looking to enact meaningful change on the competitive FIFA landscape and FUT gameplay alike, or was it self-aggrandizing kayfabe in his latest line of performance art?
FUT Weekly Podcast's Ben and Jamey, aka ""FUT Economist"", are joined by FIFA coach Steve Stokes, aka ""The FUT Tactician"", along with real-life 40-0 FIFA pro Chime ""Chimezuru"" Anyanwu to discuss the controversy. Steve in particular goes as far as to break down the game tape to explain why the game's anecdotally high propensity to ""award"" players with goals immediately after goals have been scored may not have even been the real culprit here.
The trio also discusses how you might take advantage of the very real FIFA 18 World Cup mode market crash that's underway -- and looks to get even more serious as next week's big game update arrives.

If you plan on investing in FIFA Points this year, doing so towards the beginning of the game is a great way to ensure a high return on your investment. At the start of the game, the average value of commonly packed items will be at their highest. Knowing this, many players decide to use their FIFA Points to open as many 7.5k packs as they can, as soon as possible. However, if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck, we think there are better strategies. But before diving into those strategies, let’s refresh on some basics. 
FIFA Point basics 
FIFA Points are a purchasable in-game currency that can be exchanged for packs and FUT Draft entries. At the beginning of FIFA, when players have little to no coins, those willing to invest in FIFA points can get a significant leg up. 
FIFA points are also one of the few things players can carry over from their FIFA17 accounts. Like previous years, EA will offer a one time transfer of FIFA points from FIFA 17 to FIFA 18 accounts once players log onto their consoles. Of note here, is that FIFA Point transfers are not possible on Web App. You will need to log onto your console in order to make the transfer. For more information on FIFA Points and this one time transfer, you can check out EA’s article. 
How do I best use points?
This is one the most common questions we get on social media. For the best answer, it helps to break it down by your FIFA skill, market knowledge, and the time you have to commit. 
Shrewd Trader - Low Level Player
If you fancy yourself as a proficient trader and have a fair amount of time to commit to trading/investing between the time you get your hands on the console version and the full release of the game, we recommend that you open your packs as soon as possible to scrape together coins and start trading. The earlier you can trade on the new and unstable market, the more coins you will make. One important detail, however. In order to justify this decision, you’ll need to make a substantial profit on those initial coins. This means you’ll need to be confident in your trading ability. If you are second guessing, you might want to consider option two. 
Low Level Player - Limited Time/Beginner Trader
If you only want to buy packs, it is important to know when the best value for those packs is offered. Traditionally, during Early Access through Full Release, the only gold packs offered are the standard 5k (100 FP) and 7.5k (150 FP) packs. While it can be good to open some packs to get yourself rolling at the very start, to maximize your return on FIFA points, players should wait until both a large group of special items are in packs and promo packs are available. 
This year, Ones To Watch items will be available on September 29 (Worldwide Release), meaning they will feature in packs alongside TOTW2. With upwards of 40+ special items in packs, we advise that players wait until at least the 29th to begin splurging. If you have the patience, we recommend waiting until the first Sunday of October. Last year EA released their first round of promo packs on the 2nd of October. If they follow this pattern, it will mean that the first round of promos will drop on October 1st. This would be a great time to use the bulk of your FIFA Points. 
Intermediate - High level player
Finally, for intermediate to advanced players, the best strategy for using FIFA Points is to use them for online FUT Draft entries. If you can average around two wins per entry, this is the right method for you.The rewards that you receive from a 300 FIFA Point draft entry far outweigh the reward from two 7.5k packs. Plus, you will be able to try those “elite” players that aren’t affordable right away. 
Wrapping up
Overall, our recommendation is to use your FIFA Points on drafts if you have the time and the skill. They offer the greatest return. However, we know not everyone meets that criteria. If you are crunched for time or just getting the hang of FUT, we recommend opting for one of the other two options."

A quick note: I'm going to try and review as many of the fan-favorite TOTS cards as possible over the next month. To do this, I'll be shortening these reviews, but that should allow me to hopefully write more of them. I hope you understand, and I hope you enjoy the review!
Today we'll be looking at the 93-rated TOTS Roberto Firmino. On the back of a truly incredible real-life season, and capping his ascendancy to true world-class status, Firmino has received a truly outstanding TOTS item.

I've been playing him in this team:"

It's getting awfully hard to expect non-Premier League players to be able to win FUTTIES votes.
Sure, the Prem is the most popular league in the world. But with Liverpool (and sometimes England national teamer) Nathaniel Clyne in the vote for this week, it looks like we're headed to our ninth PL pink-and-gold item in 10 tries.
The promotion's been cool overall -- voting via Squad Buildling Challenges is a nice touch -- but perhaps some kind of pivot is needed next year with one league dominating so handedly.
On that note, Manchester City starlet Gabriel Jesus won this past weekend's Favourite Future Player poll, besting Breel Donald Embolo of Schalke and Madrid's Marco Asensio.
Joining the aforementioned Clyne on the ballot through Friday are AS Roma's Bruno Peres as well as PSG (for now)'s Serge Aurier. Imagine if a hypothetically new Chelsea (or United) signing Aurier got his first PL item Friday.

As first teased last week,  Futhead have teamed up with the EA FIFA Mobile team to give you, the community, the opportunity to help pick which player should be given the all-important Tour Legend for the Global Tour event.
With all seven of the Tour Master players now revealed, we offer some advice as to who we think you should vote for, and more importantly, why.
Firstly, we look to the most recent Master in Marco Asensio. Having been chosen for the initial upgrade in the European Super Cup encounter between global powerhouses Real Madrid and Manchester United, the 21 year old Spain international could become the best Left Winger in the game by far, in terms of the boosts he provides to your team. His 96-rated Master card offers the second best boosts in that position, behind only Record Breaker Coutinho, and with the Tour Legend receiving a +1 Overall boost, it would make him a must-have for everyone who can get their hand on him.
Next, Bayern Munich's new signing Corentin Tolisso is already one of the most complete Centre Midfielders in the game, with all of his in-game stats at 90 or better (except crossing), and an upgrade could surely make him one of the best, if not the best, CM in the game in terms of all round ability, as his Tour Master card already equal to or better (in some aspects) than many of the best, and highest rated, Centre Midfielders in the game -- such as Golden Egg Sean McAllister and N'Golo Kanté, or End of an Era Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard. 
Finally, we have Kostas Manolas -- but what about voting for him then voting for an unusual left back position? He may not have played there much, if at all, in his career, but EA have shown that they are not shy of moving players into different positions from those they are best known for playing in. 'Calcio A' has proven to be one of the most popular leagues in FIFA Mobile, particularly after the emergence of Impact Dries Mertens which caused many people to fall in love with him, and the league. In the Italian top division, the leftback spot has been relatively weak in terms of good players with a high rating, so moving the Greek international to LB would help solve that issue, as well as the unexpected move of POTM Benjamin Mendy to left wing back, along with Giorgio Chiellini being the first POTW in August's Community TOTW.

Hopefully this helps give you a better idea of who to vote for, but the choice is yours, so make sure you get your vote in to help pick the Tour Legend. Let us know who you're interested in voting for and at what position in the comments below."

If there were some undeserved additions to the the La Liga TOTS, then one player in particular from the Bundesliga TOTS takes the biscuit. Aaron's prediction was solid, missing just seven names, some of which he openly admits he should have included with hindsight. So let's review the players we missed and why ... it's Reus, obviously. 
Marco Reus – CAM – Dortmund
Quite possibly a FUT record here as Marco Reus makes the Bundesliga TOTS after making just 11 appearances for Dortmund this season.  In those 11 games he notched 7 goals, which is obviously a very good return from a midfielder in a small sample of games. But, Dortmund’s end of season form was patchy at best, with them only qualifying for the Champions League on goal difference. So whilst Reus had an impact, Dortmund's season could just as easilly have ended on a sour note. I know its Reus, and I know he's beautiful, but this one is mad.
Aaron's View: Batshuayi was a punt on my part due to games played. But to even contemplate two Dortmund players getting in to the TOTS with a combined total of 21 games is simply madness. Reus shouldn’t be anywhere near this side.
Timo Werner – ST – Red Bull Leipzig
Without a doubt, Germany’s hottest striking prospect of recent times, and at just 22, Timo Werner had another solid season in which he scored 13 league goals to go with his 7 assists. Werner didn’t quite hit the heights of his breakthrough season last year (21 goals), but then neither did Red Bull Leipzig, who only just secured European football. If Werner turns it on in Russia this summer, Europe’s finest will surely be circling. 
Aaron's View: Theres not much I can say here really. I should have predicted Werner. Sometimes you have to hold your hands up and this is one of those times.
Leon Goretzka – CM – Schalke
Leon Goretzka is without doubt one of the most talented young Bundesliga midfielders around and with a summer move to Bayern Munich confirmed, that promise will need to come to fruition next season. Because if you speak to Schalke fans, they’ll tell you of a rather indifferent season from the German whose head was clearly already in Munich. Another one for the potentially “undeserved” category, but what a flipping TOTS item the looks.

Aaron's View: Theres no denying that Goretzka is a talented young player and he started the season superbl, but he since dropped off. His move to Bayern has helped him here I feel.
Lukas Hradecky – GK – Eintracht Frankfurt
In the absence of Manuel Neuer, the goalkeeping spots were well and truly up for grabs in the Bundesliga this season and the ever-present Lukas Hradecky from Eintracht Frankfurt gets the nod. Frankfurt finished a respectable 8th this season and with IF and MOTM items already under his belt, Hradecky was always in with a good chance of making the cut, along with the impressive Pavlenka who also secured a spot. 
Aaron's View: Hraecky was obvious after EA released their TOTS shortlist, but I felt like it was cheating to work from that, especially as I had filed my predictions before that list came out. I originally went for Ulreich simply for a magnificent defensive record alongside the fact I couldn’t see two keepers from lesser regarded sides getting the nod.
Salif Sane – CB – Hannover 96
Another Bundesliga TOTS player on the move is Salif Sane, who will join Goretzka’s former club Schalke in the summer. It wasn’t a great season for Hannover 96 overall, but Sane was by far their most impressive defender averaging two tackles, two interceptions and a whopping seven clearances per match. Naldo and Sane together next season for Schalke could be quite the centre back pairing. 
Aaron's View: Sane almost made my prediction but in the end I opted for Ginter simply for his offensive contribution as that’s what I thought EA would look at. I was wrong, and to be fair, selecting Sane was the right choice.
Wendell – LB – Bayer Leverkusen
It was a tough end to the season for Bayer Leverkusen who narrowly missed out on Champions League qualification on goal difference. But, the future is certainly bright for Leverkusen with the likes of Bailey and Wendell making a big impact down the left for them this season. Wendell has a few blots on his record with a couple of missed penalties and a red card, but overall, he’s been very solid and picked up 2 goals and 3 assists too.
Aaron's View: For me, Wendell should not have featured in the side, and he's clearly been helped by the fact he's a good FUT item. Therefore when there was a vote on the starting XI, he was always likely to be selected despite Max being the best LB by quite some distance.
Serge Gnabry – ST – Hoffenheim
You get the feeling that Serge Gnabry’s post Arsenal career could really take off next season as the Bayern fist team squad beckons for the young German. After scoring 11 goals at Werder Bremen last season, Gnabry notched another 10 in fewer games for third placed Hoffenheim this campaign to continue his impressive development. One to Watch next season?
Aaron's View: With Uth already in my prediction, I was hesitant to include a second Hoffenheim striker. EA deceide both were justified though and Gnabry made the cut."

After arguably the busiest and most dramatic transfer window in recent memory, it seems like every player has a Ones To Watch calibur transferred player for FIFA 18. While it’s still not known how many Ones To Watch players will get items to be released in packs early on this FUT campaign, there are certainly many new transfers to keep an eye on at FIFA 18’s release, whether they get OTWs or not.
Romelu Lukaku (Manchester United)
Arguably the biggest move of the transfer window this summer, Romelu Lukaku’s move to Manchester United is a relatively exciting move for FUT players. He’s one of six confirmed OTW items so far and, along with Neymar, could be one of the priciest items in FUT this year.

EA has dropped a whopping nine Lukaku cards throughout FUFA 17, including four IF cards. He’s likely to land himself on more than a few TOTWs in FIFA 18 and could wind up being the most valuable OTW player in FIFA 18. Lukaku has started off his Manchester United career on fire and early indications are that he will reap the rewards of playing with Paul Pogba and Henrikh Mkhitaryan.
Alexandre Lacazette (Arsenal)
When Arsenal finally landed the dangerous striker that they had coveted for some time, Lacazette’s new Gunners card skyrocketed to around 100k coins as players were excited to slide him into their Premier League squads.
Another confirmed OTW card, Lacazette will be pricey, but will likely reap big rewards if the French striker is able to seamlessly adjust to the PL. However, Arsene Wenger’s early season might be cause for concern with this item.
Sead Kolasinac (Arsenal)
Speaking of Arsenal players, Kolasinac might prove to be the bigger move for the Gunners when it all shakes out. The LB got an upgrade from a 77 to an 80 overall in FIFA 18 after being the best LB in the Bundesliga last season.
He’s seen time at both LB and CB for Arsene Wenger this season, so it will be interesting to see if and when he does get an IF what position EA elects to award him for. His 77 rated transfer card in FIFA 17 was one of the more physical LB cards in all of the Premier League, so Kolasinac could become a very desired card for squads out of the gate with 78 pace and 89 physial.
Tiemoue Bakayoko (Chelsea)
French? Chelsea? CDM? OTW? It could very well happen. After N’Golo Kante’s OTW was supremely popular in FIFA 17, we could get another defensive minded CM OTW card from the Blues in FIFA 18.
Bakayoko’s transfer from AS Monaco to Chelsea is exciting for PL squad creators, potentially giving players another strong CDM option and a perfect link to N’Golo Kante. 
Ederson (Manchester City)
Ederson was probably the best goalkeeper to switch clubs this summer. The Brazilian keeper earned a Team Of The Season card with Benfica in FIFA 17 and he already made headlines in the Premier League when he took a cleat from Liverpool’s Sadio Mane to the face.
Ederson’s transfer card gets a strong link with Chelsea’s David Luiz, so Ederson could be a great option to consider at the last line of defense in your Premier League squad, especially as a cheaper alternative to upper echelon of PL keepers like Thibaut Courtois, David De Gea, and Petr Cech.
Leonardo Bonucci (A.C. Milan)
While age likely plays a factor in EA’s qualifications for OTW players, Bonucci is still playing at an extremely high level and commanded €40 million on the transfer market in his move from Juventus to A.C. Milan this month.
His OTW item in FIFA 18 is already confirmed, and could be the anchor to a completely revamped Milan squad next season. 
Pepe (Besiktas)
Pepe freely moved from Real Madrid to Besiktas and, more importantly, became part of the best meme of the transfer window. If you don’t ignore the Super Lig early on in FIFA 18, you could snag the 86-rated Pepe for a bargain compared to his price in recent years and anchor your back line for a fraction of the cost of what it could cost in a main league.
#ComeToBeşiktaş pic.twitter.com/x2o2xmsc2R— Beşiktaş JK (@Besiktas) August 2, 2017

Hakan Calhanoglu (A.C. Milan)
Calhanoglu was quietly having an excellent season in the Bundesliga prior to his FIFA ban for an illegal transfer as a teenager, earning a pair of IFs and a Scream Team card.
He could quickly become one of the best left-sided players in the Calcio A and his deadly free kicks give him a boost in value. Despite getting a downgrade in pace (who didn’t?), the LM is yet another A.C. Milan transfer that could give your Calcio A squad a different look as you start to build up your team.
Douglas Costa (Juventus)
Speaking of left-sided players in the Calcio A, Douglas Costa gets a fresh start with Juventus after a turbulent season in the Bundesliga with Bayern Munchen. The five-star skiller has a confirmed OTW item in FIFA 18, but it comes with a downgrade in overall by two.
Players love Costa because of his pace, five-star skills, and Brazilian nation links so his OTW card will likely be one of the supremely popular black cards.
Neymar Jr.
Yes, of course the priciest transfer in the history of world football certainly deserves your attention in FIFA 18. He’s one of the six confirmed OTW players in FIFA 18, but unless you pack him or take out a second mortgage on your house for some FIFA Points, it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to afford him early on in the game. 
That being said, his PSG transferred gold card should end up being a bit cheaper than Neymar’s Barcelona item in FIFA 17. So, building a Ligue 1 or Brazilian sweat squad with the intentions of adding Neymar down the road could be a great play early in FIFA 18.
James Rodriguez
The final player on the list with a confirmed OTW item in FIFA 18, Rodriguez’s move to Bayern Munich was one of the most intriguing moves of the summer window. After losing his spot in Real Madrid’s starting eleven, all signs pointed to Rodriguez getting a fresh start somewhere else. Playing in the middle of the pitch with Arturo Vidal and Thiago should give Rodriguez the space to do what he does best.
Rodriguez instantly becomes an elite option in the midfield for Bundesliga squads, and only Thiago matches his 85-rated passing in the entire league."

Today, we'll be looking at the new FUTTIES Winner Jesus.

In a stunning turn of events, we have another Premier League FUTTIES Winner! However, I have no complaints this time -- Jesus's OTW/IF item is absolutely insane, and this one looks even better.
In-game stats
He has some very, very good in-game stats.

The key ones are 93 attack positioning, 87 vision, 88 acceleration, 97 agility, 93 balance, 86 jumping, 90 reactions, 91 sprint speed, 99 stamina, 65 strength, 88 ball control, 92 dribbling, 90 finishing, 87 heading accuracy, 76 long shots, 87 short pass and 83 shot power. He also has a four-star weak foot, and five-star skills.
I used him with a Hawk chemistry style, just to boost his pace into the high 90s, his shooting into the low 90s, his physical into the low 80s (and most importantly, his strength to 70 and aggression to 62).

This chemistry style boosts him to a 91-rated ST, 92-rated CF and a 90-rated CAM.

Squad
I used Jesus in the following squad: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7620713/

In-game, I switch to the 41212(2), with Jesus and Hazard up to, and Dembele in behind, and a midfield of Gerrard on the right, Luiz on the left, and Petit at CDM.
Stats
Here are my stats with Gabriel Jesus:
Price: Cost me around ~15K + Untradeables.
Games: 6 (3 rage quits)
Goals: 10
Assists: 2
Chemistry Style: Hawk
As you can see, he tore it up for me.
Let's get into the review.

Pace: 10/10

Electrifying. He actually feels faster than the 90 pace this item has -- much more like the 97 given to him by the Hawk chemistry style. He's gone in a flash. I had absolutely no issues with this, and he could outpace his opponents with ease. 
Shooting: 10/10
This man can create something from almost nothing -- it's like he turns water into the finest wine. Gabriel Jesus can take a seemingly innocuous position, and turn it into a goal scoring opportunity. All he needs is a yard of space, and he can punish his opponents. Outside the box, his long shots were superb. They swerve, dip and power their way into the top corners, and either force a world-class save, cannon off the woodwork or threaten to tear a hole in the net. Inside the box, he may be one of the better finishers I've used. Astoundingly clinical, on either foot, and with any kind of shot. He's a goal-scoring machine.
Passing: 8/10
Very, very good. He didn't get too many assists, but that was mostly down to some unreal goalkeeping. His vision is exceptional, and it makes it very deadly for your opponents. He was able to pick out, and successfully complete, some very difficult passes. His short passing is virtually perfect, with only the occasional mis-placed pass, and his long passing felt far better than his stats would show. I didn't get a chance to test his crossing, so I can't comment on that. He does have abysmal free kick stats, so don't take them with him.
Dribbling: 10/10
Sublime. When you think of the greatest dribblers in the game, you think of the great Brazilians. For them, dribbling is almost sacred -- it makes the game beautiful, and it has made for some of the greatest moments in footballing history.
Gabriel Jesus continues on that tradition. He is perfect on the ball. Effortless gliding along the field, weaving his way through opponents, perfectly stopping and starting and turning with the ball at his feet. Ball control is perfect, dribbling is perfect, agility and balance are perfect, reactions are perfect. His five-star skill moves only make this better. Truly one of the best dribblers I've used this year.
Defending: N/A
He's not that tall, not that strong, and has abysmal defending stats. But, his 99 stamina means he can harrass the opponent's back line all game long. I'm not giving him a rating for this, but keep that in mind.
Physical: 7/10
He definitely feels stronger and more aggressive than his item stats would suggest. Strength feels like it is in the mid- to high-70s, and his aggression feels like it is in the 70s. He holds his own against the weaker players in this game, but he can get bull-dozed by the stronger ones. I'd suggest keeping him out of physical challenges -- use his pace, dribbling and fantastic shooting to get out of tight spots.
I fully expected him to just hang around on crosses. However, his high jumping and heading accuracy made him a potent aerial threat, even against far taller players.
Weak foot: 9/10
Absolutely no issues with his weak foot. At times, it felt like a five-star weak foot, but at times, it was a little on the weak side. However, it shouldn't be an issue.
Skills: 10/10
He's got the skills to pay the bills. He's relatively quick going into and coming out of skill moves (but not as fast as TOTS Dembele, Neymar or Giuliano), and his ball control during the skills is very good. His lack of strength means he can get knocked over while skilling, but it's not a huge issue.
Summary
For 50-60K, you can get one of the most enjoyable, and most effective, strikers in this game -- therefore, getting him is a no-brainer. The item far outplays its rating: he's fast, brilliant on the ball, and a magician in front of goal. This is the perfect item to see out FIFA 17.
Rating: 9/10
Value for Coins: 10/10"

FIFA 17 Ultimate Team's Team of the Week may not be at the forefront of your thought process like it might be in the Autumn, but that doesn't mean there aren't a few gems worth possibly investing or building a future Daily Knockout Tournament Squad around in this week's side. What is this time of year for if not for experimentation after all?
Once again, TOTW focuses around the few domestic leagues still in action. USA's MLS showcases some of the best and brightest still getting black-and-gold/silver/bronze in-form items at this juncture in the game's lifecycle. Since his extinct FIFA 15 in-form Sporting KC's blazer of a centerback Ike Opara's become a bit of an Ultimate Team cult figure. He returns to glory in TOTW 41, with a new item in the spirit of his Halloween-themed Scream one from this past October.
There's not a ton more to write home about -- if you aren't a K-League or Bronze Pack Method partisan -- but hey, it's some new items in a time of the year that's about to be particularly starved for them. 
Besides, we're another week closer to the return of the big five leagues -- and FIFA 18, to boot.

He's back.
98-overall Luka Modric, as first seen during FIFA Mobile's Team of the Year, is back, with new, different ratings and the same boosts as Ultimate TOTS Dele Alli, joining him as the highest non-overall-boosting players in the game.
As widely rumored thanks to a, uh, bit of an untimely leak, the plan isn't cheap: to make up for there only being two weeks in this month's Player of the Month, you'll need 100 trophies (starting at 25,000 coins a pop BIN) along with both June POTM tokens and POTW Modric to get the overpowered 98 version.
July's Player of the Month, now under the new Community Team of the Week structure, should be more in line with previous months where all you need is the corresponding Player of the Week and the four July Player of the Month tokens.
We'd love to hear how 98 POTM Modric treats you if you endeavor to build him. Let us know in the comments below."

What is EA Access (Origin Access)?
In 2014, EA launched a monthly subscription service called EA Access. For $4.99 a month (or $29.99 USD for a year), players were granted early, trial access to EA’s games days before their worldwide releases. 
Last year, EA Access members had to opportunity to play FIFA 17 for 10 hours, days before the worldwide launch. While this may not seem significant, it was a big deal. The trial period allowed players to hop onto Ultimate Team on console to start playing games and earning coins. But perhaps the most significant, was that early access members could load up FIFA points on their account before everyone else. This meant that players could get hoards of coins to invest and buy their starter teams before prices skyrocketed during the first couple weeks. 
This year, Xbox and PC (through Origin Access) players with will be able to play the game days before the release of the Icon/Ronaldo editions. The official launch date of the EA Access window is set for the Thursday, September 21. However, there is good reason to believe that it will come out in the late evening of the 20th. EA Access has typically launched earlier than the official launch date. For more details on the possible launch date, check out our article covering a predicted September calendar for FIFA 18. 
Is Early Access Worth It?
We certainly think so! You only need to sign up for one month of EA Access to get the game early. You can cancel your subscription after you are done playing. This means that for $4.99 you can play ultimate team for 10 hours before most others. You will be able to load up FIFA points and with the coins you make from those packs, you'll be able to trade and invest with clout. Again, the age old saying, “you need money to make money” comes into play here. Large coin totals are like gold dust in the beginning of the game. 
To put it another way, $4.99 buys you 500 FIFA points. That is the equivalent of three 7.5k packs. If you think about the average return from those packs, you’re likely to conclude that one month of EA Access is the way to go! 
How to Best Use Your Time
Now that we’ve gone over the basics, let’s dive into what we recommend you do during the those precious 10 hours to maximize your coin totals heading into launch.
The Do's
Before you log into FIFA 18 and start your 10 hour timer, you’ll want to get a few things in order. First, you should pre-plan your starter squad. This way you can waste no time crafting your Squad Battles squad (if you plan on playing them… we’ll talk more about that later). You’ll also want know which nation you plan on choosing for you starter pack so you don’t have to think about it when the option comes up (see menu screenshot below). For more info on this prepping, check out our starter team analysis where we breakdown the most popular leagues and nations for starter squad building.

You will also want to select your club name ahead of time so that you don’t have to think about it when you are prompted to set one. Below are some names to get you thinking. 

Once you’ve finished your prepping, it’s time to fire up FIFA. After you’ve agreed to EA’s terms and services and find yourself on the main menu, head over to the EA FC Catalog. Here, you’ll want to tab over to the Ultimate Team portion of  the catalog and buy every reward and bonus you can get your hands on. If your EA FC points are limited, you priorities should be; match coin boosts, transfer list space, and anything that you can sell on the transfer market (i.e. kits, badges, contracts, etc.). 
Now that you’ve raided the catalog, let’s fire up Ultimate Team. There are a number of different ways that you can spend the next ~9.5 hours. Let’s break it down by skill level and whether or not you plan on investing in FIFA Points.
FIFA Points + Intermediate-Advanced Skill Level
If the above description sounds like you, we recommend loading up FIFA points right away and then jumping into Online Draft. If you are decent player, the rewards that you receive from a 300 FIFA Point draft entry far outweigh the reward from two 7.5k packs. Do as many of these drafts as you can in your limited time. 
If you run out of points, log out of FIFA, hop onto the Web App, build a starter team, and jump back in and play Squad Battles. If you can’t stomach playing against the computer, your next best alternative is playing divisions.
FIFA Points + Beginner Skill Level
If the above description sounds like you, we recommend loading up FIFA points right away and then jumping into Offline Draft. Set the difficulty to whatever you can handle and consistently win at (last year, rewards were not affected by set difficulty and it’s likely that this year will be the same) and win as many as you can. The reward you receive, even for offline draft, is significantly greater than what you get from two 7.5k packs.
No FIFA Points + All Skill Levels 
From what we’ve seen, the rewards for Squad Battles are rather decent this year. If you have the patience to play against the computer and grind your way to the top of the leaderboards, you will be rewarded handsomely. If you would rather play against other humans, we recommend playing divisions. 
The Don’ts 
Now that we’ve gone over some of things that you should do during your 10 hours of Early Access, let’s cover some things you’ll want to avoid.

Leaving your game open - There is a timer that runs whenever the game is open. If you pause to take an extended break, close out of FIFA 18 completely so you don’t waste time.
Trading - Probably sounds a bit ironic coming from someone that goes by the name “FutEconomist”, but if you plan on trading, don’t waste your time doing it on console. Spend your time trading on the Web App. 
Buying Consumables/Squad Tweaking - After you play a handful of games, you’ll likely need to take a break from playing to upgrade some of your squad and buy consumable items. We recommend that you do this on the Web App instead of burning valuable time on console.
Open Packs - If you plan on opening packs, we recommend that you open them on the Web App. While we agree that it is considerably more fun to open them on console, in terms of maximizing your time, you’re best served opening your packs and selling your packed items on the Web App. 
Play Career Mode or Other Game Modes - There is no real advantage to playing game modes other than FUT early. Even if these are your primary game modes, we encourage you to spend the majority of your time playing FUT to maximize your early coin totals."

Well, what is there to say about this TOTW? It's not exactly an inspiring selection (Bale aside), but with the TOTY on the horizon and winter breaks still in force across Europe, it was always likely to be slim pickings for Aaron's predictions which missed nine players this week. 
Sergi Roberto – RB – Barcelona
Barcelona are still winning football matches at a canter and that continued against Levante after their Christmas break, with a 3-0 win. Goals from Messi, Suarez and Paulinho did the job, but the IF story was a straight shoot out between the two fullbacks Jordi Alba and Sergi Roberto who both recorded assists. Roberto’s 6 tackles inch him over the line for the IF in week 17.
Aaron's View: I opted for Alba who did exactly the same as Roberto due to the fact he was a popular option in the community. It could have gone either way and unfortunately that way was not in my favour.
Yacine Brahimi – LM – Porto
Both Porto and Sporting Lisbon maintained their unbeaten to starts to the Portuguese league season with Porto beating Vitoria de Guimaraes 4-2 last weekend. The major outcry from the Futhead comments was for Marega who scored twice here making it 14 league goals this season, and not a single IF in FUT 18. Brahimi scored here too, and is also in great form, but still #FreeMarega
Aaron's View: One of several players which I predicted a team mate of this week. Brahimi was the weaker option in my eyes for his goal considering that Marega scored twice himself.
Luka Milivojevic – CDM – Crystal Palace
Since Roy Hodgson’s arrival Crystal Palace’s form and results have picked up massively after a disastrous start. One of the reasons for that has been the form of Luka Milivojevic in the middle of the park who popped up with the winning goal against Southampton in the 79th minute. The Serbian stopper also put in 2 tackles, 4 interceptions and 2 aerial clearances for his side. 
Aaron's View: There was a severe lack of PL options and thus it was always likely that I would miss one or two with just the two predicted from my side. Milivojevic scored once and thankfully was the only PL player I missed.
Matheus – GK – SC Braga
SC Braga are having a great season so far, currently occupying 4th place in the Liga NOS and they won again on the weekend scraping past Rio Ave 2-1 with a late winner from Fabio Martins sealing the points. The IF however, goes to Matheus who only made four saves in this one, but he did also save a penalty the game prior against Boavista in their 3-1 win. So a nice accumulation of form for the Brazilian but no clean sheets in either game. 

Aaron's View: Matheus was actually my third choice keeper and thus narrowly missed out. His match rating was lower than the other two I selected but obviously EA felt Sirigu’s TIF was too soon.
Lorenzo de Silvestri – RB – Torino
After three games without a win Torino finally converted their run of draws in to three points with a win against Bologna. Sirigu was tipped by us due to his penalty save but the IF goes to Lorenzo de Silvestri who scored the opener from right back before Niang and Falque went on to comfortably despatch their mid-table rivals. 
Aaron's View: Yet another one which I predicted a team mate from. I mentioned that Silvestri was the other strong option but instead opted for Sirigu in his place, who saved a penalty in the same game.
Pablo Aguilar – CB – Club Tijuana
It was the opening day of the Liga MX on Saturday where Club Azul and Club Tijuana played out a 0-0 draw. Now on the surface of things you’d assume IF’s were unlikely but after re-signing Pablo Aguilar was a rock at the back for his second-time new club making 3 tackles and a whopping 14 clearances for Tijuana. What a way to make your return.

Aaron's View: One of the more random ones of the week. A dull 0-0 draw in Mexico with very little statistically in his favour.
Anastasios Bakasetas – LWB – AEK Athens
With just two points between the top four teams, things are awfully tight at the top of the Greek Super League and therefore it was important AEK Athens kept pace at the top by winning 4-1 away against Panetolikos. Bakasetas scored one and assisted another here but mostly you’re all annoyed with his LWB position when he played higher up. Naughty EA. 
Aaron's View: A goal and an assists for Bakasetas suggests that I missed an obvious player and I would agree if he played LWB but all sources I found pointed towards him playing LM rather than LWB and thus making him a weaker candidate.
Danilo – CM – SC Braga
A second IF for SC Braga this week coming from the same set of midweek and weekend matches of which Danilo was probably the most impressive of Braga’s IF duo, grabbing a goal and an assist against Boavista and then another assist in their game at Rio Ave later in the week.
Aaron's View: With a lot of Primeira Liga players already being predicted by mysel,f I felt that a goal and an assist was weaker than the other selection I had already made. He gets in over Novais’s brace though for a reason I don’t know.
Memela – LW – Orlando Pirates
And finally we head over to South Africa where the Orlando Pirates were in action against FC Baroka where all the action was contained to the first 30 minutes of the match. The only problem for Baroka was that Orlando Pirates found the net 3 times in that half hour madness and Memela scored twice. So in he goes to TOTW 17. 
Aaron's View: Memela almost made my side but after a Monday hat trick was removed. It’s rare to see a south African league representative and although he was a good option with two goals to his name it is still somewhat of a surprise."

The show must go on.
Despite just two of the ""Big 5"" domestic leagues in Europe still in action this past week, FIFA 18's Ultimate Team Team of the Week 36's still coming in hot.
In a truly ""what year is this?"" moment, 2000s Spanish standouts David Villa and Fernando Torres, in his Atletico Madrid swan song, both get black-and-gold in-forms this week. They're joined by the likes of an 82 OVR LW Hakan Calhanoglu, 84 RW Malcom (who ostensibly misses out on a Ligue 1 Team of the Season re-release as a result?), plus PSG/France keeper Alphonse Areola.
We've had better and we've had worst TOTWs, and that'll certainly hold true moving forward, but some of these may wind up helping you complete SBCs if you pull them while chasing expected 'Calcio A' and/or Ligue 1 TOTS soon if nothing else.
Here's the full FUT 18 TOTW 36:"

In this series, I'll be picking two players and playing them in the same positions in the same teams, and seeing how they compare with one another. We'll see if conventional wisdom is right and whether or not there's bargains to be had.
Today, it's all about the young French, TOTS right-wingers: Florian Thauvin and Ousmane Dembele. Both of them have received incredible TOTS items, and thanks to the recent TOTS SBCs, they've both become more affordable.
The items

Let's start with TOTS Ousmane Dembele.

Dembele is one of the hottest prospects in world football. Electrifying pace, unbelievable ball control and dribbling, great vision, an eye for goal, great on both feet, and a maturity well beyond his year. These traits translate perfectly into FIFA 17 -- he started as a 77-rated gold item, was upgraded to an 80-rated gold item, and he has an 83-rated TOTGS item, a 85-rated IF and OTW, an 86-rated MOTM item and now this 91-rated TOTS item. He also has the 5-star weak foot/5-star skills combination, making him one of the most complete players around. His face-item stats are incredible, with 90+ for pace, shooting, passing and dribbling, and he's a 94-rated RW and 95-rated CAM without even applying a chemistry style (those ratings go up to 96 and 96 on the Basic chemistry style).
Florian Thauvin's story is just as impressive. This Newcastle-reject has had the season of his life, and has become the player we all thought he could be. Just like Dembele, he started the season with a 77-rated item (though his was non-rare), but has since picked up an 81-rated upgraded item, as well as 84-, 86-, 87-, and 88-rated informs, and now this 93-rated TOTS item. His item is utterly ridiculous -- he has 5 90+ face item stats, and a 95-rating in his prefered RW position without a chemistry style (that rating goes up to a 97 with a Basic chemistry style).

Squads

To keep this review fair, I used both players in the same squad, which I used for 12 Division I games. Dembele played in the first three, then Thauvin in the next three, then Dembele in the next three, and finally Thauvin in the final three. They both played on 10-chemistry, with the Marksman chemistry style on Dembele, and Marksman and Hawk (three games each) on Thauvin, as well as with 99 fitness at the start of every match.

FIFA staple Marius Hjerpseth is never not a source of good insight in the community.
Saturday evening, after a contentuous patch divided factions of the FIFA scene over the course of the past several days, Marius took to EA's official FIFA forums to try and offer some wisdom as to why the hotly debated new opponent indicator (similar to what we've seen for decades in head-to-head two player matches) is actually a net positive for FUT.
Though you certainly don't have to agree with him -- after all, as he mentions, a lot of this comes down to personal preference -- it's awfully hard not to read his dissertation on the topic and not see the inherent good points in it.
Be sure to follow Marius on Twitter if you aren't already. Here's his full thoughts on the new player opponent indicator, and why it's perhaps not as bad as you may have first thought:

Earlier this week the first title update for FIFA 18 was released on PC, XBOX One and PS4. According to the patch notes released by EA, goalkeeper reactions have been tuned, shot accuracy has been slightly reduced in certain in-game situations, and a number of other issues have been addressed. One change that has caused a lot of debate on social media, is the enabling of the opponent indicators in all Online Modes. The indicator is the iconic coloured triangle that hovers above the head of the player you are currently controlling. Previously opponent indicators were only enabled in offline game modes and Online Pro Clubs. Now it's enabled in Online Seasons and FUT as well. Some people love it, some people hate it. I will share my opinion and explain why I think it's an excellent change, but first - let me go through some of the negative feedback I've seen floating around on the internet.
So why do some people dislike the indicator? I've not seen anyone suggest that their attacking play has been negatively affected by it, but some people claim that their defensive strategy no longer work and they are very upset as a result. In the past, the defending user would always know which player the attacking user was controlling - obviously the player with the ball, but there was no easy way for the attacking user to know which player the defending user was controlling, and the defending user could take advantage of this imbalance. They could hold R1/RB to send an AI teammate to put pressure on the dribbler, whilst they were manually covering passing lanes with another player, effectively doing two jobs at once. As soon as the time was right, they could tap L1/LB to instantly take control over the defender closest to the ball and rush forward to tackle. From the attacking user's perspective, they could not know if the defender in front of them was AI or human, so it would not be clear if they were in danger of being tackled or not (AI players can't really rush you, human players can), and if the passing lanes were mostly covered too, they would be left without a lot of options to move forward. In other words, this was a very effective way to defend, so it's no wonder people liked to do it, but after the latest update, you have to rethink your strategy.
My personal opinion is that disguising yourself amongst your teammates and letting the AI do a lot of the work is - if not a cheap tactic - a style of play that shouldn't be encouraged because it renders every match virtually the same. It reduces the amount of spectacular moments that can only happen when two human minds go at it. One mind using FIFA as a vehicle to claim dominance over the other, via creativity, experience and lightning fast reflexes.
But let's assume for a second that relying on the help of the AI to win the ball back is a completely legitimate strategy. What happens if you sit down on the couch next to your mate to play 1v1 in FIFA? You're both looking at the same TV screen, so obviously you will be able to see your opponents indicator. If you get beat every single match, would you blame the game for revealing which players you were controlling defensively, or would you have to admit that your friend is just better than you at FIFA? Maybe you don't care because you never play offline, but clearly a lot of people do, so this has to be considered.
What if you played online without indicators and qualified for an eSports event? At the event the indicators would likely be enabled. We know - as demonstrated by the reactions online - that seeing or not seeing the indicator has a major effect on how people play. This inconsistency would harm the growth of FIFA as an eSport. The game you play at home should be identical to the game you play on the main stage. Again, maybe you don't care about this because your aim isn't to qualify for any eSports events, but we must look at the big picture and realize that it is necessary to enable the indicators across all game modes in order to preserve consistency.
Even with indicators disabled, if the attacking user really wanted to know which defender their opponent was controlling, they could simply look down at the player name bar. So the newly enabled indicators are not actually revealing any new information to the attacking user, it just makes it easier to pay attention to it. So if you are against the new change, your best argument would be that a piece of information has been moved from the bottom of the screen to a more central area.
So why is it a good thing? Well, as subtle as it may be, I think this is a very positive change for the FIFA-series as a whole. Moving forward, I think it helps to set the foundation upon which an even more balanced game can be built. I will attempt to explain why I think that.
When you are creating a football video-game, after you finish pre-production and everything else that needs to be done, you eventually get to a place where it's time to start testing the gameplay. You get a group of people together and you play for hours and hours. Everyone reports what their experience is like, every tiny little thing that needs to be tweaked, fixed, added or removed. The goal is to create a game that is entertaining to play, with a deep learning curve that let's an experienced gamer enjoy the game just as much as someone who has picked up the control pad for the first time. To find the right balance is very difficult, but it is crucial. That's why it's important to test the game as much as possible before it's released to the world.
In reality it's more complicated than this, but let's make up some numbers and imagine 100 game testers, and let's split them up into two equally large groups. Group A plays offline matches with indicators enabled. Group B plays online matches with indicators disabled. The indicator affects how you play, so group B might have a different experience than group A, and they might have conflicting ideas about what needs to be done to improve the gameplay. A change such as disabling or enabling the opponent indicator may give rise to a whole new set of issues that you were not previously aware of. So if you primarily test the gameplay with indicators enabled, but end up disabling them from a specific game mode, you run the risk of shipping a game that is less balanced than you thought it was. Now that there is consistency between offline and online modes, you no longer need two groups. Instead you have a single group of 100 testers playing the same game. When everyone is working with the exact same conditions, it's easier to streamline the feedback process and build a more balanced game.
In addition to everything I've already talked about - it will be interesting to study the ripple effects of this change.
I think users will be less likely to defend by tracking back with their midfield players, and instead chose to control their defenders. This means midfielder's work rates are more important, because it's up to the AI to decide if it wants to assist you defensively or not.
It will be a little easier to keep possession, and the team with the ball has more control over the tempo of the match, so it's possible that passing accuracy must be tweaked to give the defending team a better chance of winning the ball.
Player switching (L1/LB & Right Stick) might prove to be an area that needs more work.
Also, even if people understand why the indicator has to be there, they might decide that they don't want to see it - maybe it distracts them - so I think there should be an option to disable it in the game settings.
Again, this change will likely make the game different in many subtle ways, but there is no doubt in my mind that it is ultimately a good thing.
I just wrote 1,500 words on why I think a few colored pixels should be visible on the screen. If it's possible to say this much about a change so small, I can't even imagine what it's like for the dev team to build a brand new game every year, when thousands of these things must be considered. So to wrap this up, I want to take a moment and express my gratitude to all the people who work so incredibly hard - game devs and community members included - to build what I think is the best virtual representation of the sport we all love - football."

It was essentially a given Neymar Jr., on the heels of a world record 222m Euros move to Paris Saint-Germain, would be amongst the Ones To Watch Players in this Autumn's FIFA 18. Now we know so officially.
In a slick social media video displaying what it'll look like if you're fortunate enough to pack the Brazilian five-star skiller, EA unveiled the new OTW item design as well as one of the new PSG superstar's possible walkout animations:

The ratings above are not finalized.
A number have speculated in their estimation that Neymar's PSG move will hurt his item's market value, given the relatively scarcity of Ligue 1 squads and the lack of high profiles links LaLiga afforded him. One thing's for sure: Pretty much regardless, this OTW item is going to cost a pretty penny."

With most of the major European Leagues shutting down before the World Cup begins this is likely to be the last ""big name"" TOTW for a few months with the MLS taking up the slack in the meantime. Aaron managed to hit all of those ""big"" names this week leave us with just five Unpredictables. 
Jonas Lossl – GK – Huddersfield
Huddersfield have done a fantastic job to stay in the Premier League in their debut season and one of the main reasons for that has been the consistency of Jonas Lossl in goal. He makes TOTW35 for an absolute worldy of a save in their midweek fixture against Chelsea which secured their top-flight status, and ended Chelsea’s late challenge on the Champions League places.
Aaron's View: I never even considered Lossl but with a lack of goalkeeping options it was always likely that one would be missed. That said, I don’t feel Lossl did that much at all despite his save. 
Dimitri Lienard – LWB – RC Strasbourg
RC Strasbourg left it late, but they did manage to secure their status in Ligue 1 for another season with a last gasp freekick scored by Dimitri Lienard in the 93rd minute enough to sink Lyon and ensure a 3-2 victory.  Lienard also made four tackles, one interception and one key pass in this game but the freekick is the reason he's in. 
Aaron's View: Lienard was a confusing one with L’Equipe’s TOTW listing him as a midfielder, suggesting he played more as a left winger. As is often the case with these formations it is up for debate and EA obviously classed him as LWB.
Pavel Kaderabek – RWB – Hoffenheim
Hoffenheim have had a fantastic season to finish 3rd in the Bundesliga and they finished things off in style last weekend with an impressive 3-1 win over perennial title challengers Dortmund, running out 3-1 winners. Kramaric grabbed a goal and assist putting himseld in the frame, but the IF goes to right back Pavel Kaderabek who scored the last goal in the 72nd minute. 
Aaron's View: Another debatable position here for Kaderabek, and although Kicker did list him in the RWB role, he didn’t make their TOTW and that swayed my decision. 
Lucas Alario – ST – Bayer Leverkusen
Bayer Leverkusen needed goals a plenty on the final day of the Bundesliga  season and they did manage to get three against Hannover, but they conceded two which left them just shy of Dortmund who qualify for the Champions League on goal difference. Lucas Alario scored twice however and makes the TOTW on that basis taking his league tally to nine for the season. 
Aaron's View: With Bundesliga options being few and far between, it left the door open for quite a few players with only “good” returns and Alario was one of them. 
Marlon Ritter – CAM –  SC Paderborn
Paderborn were comfortably promoted from the third tier of German football some time ago finishing the season with a massive 14-point gap to third place. But, they still ended the season strong beating Fortuna Koln 4-2 in which Marlon Ritter scored a hat-trick for the away side ending his campaign on 12 league goals.
Aaron's View: EA rarely expand to more than 5 non-gold players per TOTW and I ignored Ritter for what I thought was a stronger first five. All five I selected were included but EA decided to go for sixth and funnily enough, Ritter would have been my choice as well."

With not a lot of options to use stamina on since the end of Team of the Season and the outstanding Summer Program that just wrapped Monday, FIFA Mobile is about to get a whole lot more interesting.
Enter 'Retro Stars'. Creating an ability for you to upgrade older program players from past programs, the latest FM promo will bring back items from past promotions that were OP at the time and give you the opportunity to upgrade them to a brand spanking new upgraded rating.
Each week for the next several, three different players from the not-too-distant past will be showcased with plan requirements tweaked based on both the player's current/base rating plus what their new upgraded rating will be.
The Retro Stars Live Event guarantees a(n Elite) Fame Token with a (Silver) Talent or, if you're lucky, a (Gold) Throwback Token on subsequent follow up wins.
You'll be able to trade in Talent, Throwback, as well as Fame tokens into the Retro Player plans, along with the original issuance of that player item to receive an upgraded Retro Star version of the item.
You'll also be able to trade in Talent and program tokens for 1 Fame Token and 10 Program Wildcard tokens to complete the former.
The 'Retro Stars' plans are all available for your perusal here. As has been customary lately, there's a Martial Token Program Master Plan available as well.
While the program was introduced on a Wednesday, you can expect new items on Tuesdays moving forward for most of the rest of the Summer.
Here are this week's base retro cards (and their upgrades):


85 CF Carniball Mario Balotelli to 91 ST Mario Balotelli


87 CB Scream Team Pepe to 94 CB Retro Stars Pepe


93 RW Football Freeze Thomas Müller to 98 RF Retro Stars Thomas Müller


Are there any players from past programs you'd like to see? Maybe the super-over-powered MLS Playoffs Tim Howard? Let us know in the comments below."

It was nice to see some semblance of rationality restored by EA last week, and with it came a solid week of predictions for yours truly. As Team of the Year dawns, hopefully we can provide similar accuracy to help you amass those FUT fortunes.
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Ajax vs Feyenoord
Match Info: De Klassieker kicks off this weeks predictions! A big game with a lot of hype will hopefully pay off. Make sure to invest smart, especially after the MK/Wimbledon debacle last week. Stay close to those non-rares.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


KAA Gent v KSC Lokeren
Match Info:  Ah, it's been a while since the Pro League has gotten some love; hopefully EA will come through again. A matchup not receiving too much hype, so look to the higher rated players here.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 rated


Player Requirement: 2 to 3 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


OGC Nice vs Monaco
Match Info:  A few people had this listed in their predictions last week. However, the game falls on this cycle, not last week's. It’s a compelling fixture as the Ligue 1 returns, but also a lot of other rivalries. Again, stick to non-rares for the lowest risk.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Pumas (UNAM) vs America
Match Info:  A couple weeks ago, EA snuck in a rather random Liga MX match. But this week they have not just one but two rivalries to choose from. The listed one is more high profile, while Puebla vs Veracruz lurks in the shadows.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there tends to be some variance each week, let's take a look at some more outside the box picks that could make their way in:
Arsenal vs Crystal Palace
Match Info: Been saying it for a while, but always have to include a PL matchup. We have a feeling they will go random, but two teams from London squaring off shouldn't be ignored. Invest cautiously here though. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Leeds vs Millwall
Match Info: We stay in England, yet this Championship matchup is an established derby. These two teams squaring off could leave investors with some sizable profit. Don’t be afraid to sell into hype here.  

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Sparta Rotterdam vs Excelsior
Match Info: Another derby in the Eredivisie; however, it’s related to sleeper due to the nature of the Ajax game. Still investing in this can only payoff either way, so get on this hedge. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Lyon vs PSG
Match Info: Finally, another Ligue 1 match ends the week. Hopefully you’re still reading cause this one is quite big. Not many people are talking about this one, so coin making could be very profitable with this tie.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
You know how random EA can be so let’s fight fire with fire.
Inter vs Roma
Investing Strategies
It's that time. Remember to take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team on how to possible make a few coins with would-be Marquee Matchups:

-- Prioritize investing in players who are members of the two teams featuring in a specific Marquee Matchup (higher rated the better)
-- Non-Rare cards usually have a higher return on investment
-- Certain positions such as LB/RB, CMs and STs are generally more profitable"

Let's get the obvious out of the way first and foremost: The FIFA Mobile Global Tour Program was, hands down, the best in the game's first year at it. It was accessible; grindible; engaging; to say nothing of its addictive quality. Whether you're a super casual once every few day Free-2-Play player or a hardcore Credit Card FC budding Roman Abramovich, there was something to like and something directed at you.
On the high end of the scale comes the Global Tour Program Legend, 99-overall Kostas Manolas. As chosen by the FIFA Mobile community (right here on Futhead no less), Manolas joins Player of the Month Sergio Ramos as the second-highest rated centerbacks in the game. WIth his +1 OVR primary boost, he's already in a class with VsA Master David Luiz. But the 20,300,000 coin question: How does he measure up in game?
Of course, we're remiss to point out the other obvious before getting into the weeds: this card, while not impossible for non-big spenders, caters mostly to FM's one percent. We've all seen the wild traders professing to have grossed 50 million plus (before the market changes) on Twitter and the /r/FUTMobile sub-Reddit.  With Manolas tradeable, it's theoretically possible for those to get in the action -- if they're lucky enough to see one ever so briefly on the transfer market. The rest would've necessitated heavy spends and/or a serious amount of pack luck to complete. 
With the Global Tour Program now a wrap, it's market or bust for Manolas. And those same types will have to resort to the $99/99/€99.99 2,500,000 coin packs if they don't have the cash flow or didn't pick him up already. If that means you, read on -- you might just like what we have to say. If it's not, that's okay too. Curiosity and/or fan wish-fulfillment analysis ahead.
We kick things off with the stats:

Manolas isn't quite the attacking force 99 Ramos or 100 David Luiz are, but he outclasses them as defenders, per the stats. And that's really saying something. Every FM enthusiast has cursed the name Ramos since the 98-rated Team of the Year version launched, and his 99's even better. There probably isn't a single post-game update CB (RIP Bailly/Chedjou/Ciman) more capable of turning your hairs gray than Real Madrid's bell cow.
Manolas changes that. The numbers do it justice. And when you begin to get into the turn-to-turn gauntlet of going up against him, you start to see it too. 
It's easy to overhype and praise the latest and greatest high rated player item in the game, but Manolas is the real deal. If you want to understand why some were trying to selfishly advocate for Manolas to have ended up a CDM in the fan vote, a few turns against him will quickly help you get on their level.
STATS
Games: 7

Goals: N/A
Assists: 1 (!)
Ankles broken: Too many
When I closed my eyes last night, I saw visions of Manolas sliding a dozen yards towards me like some kind of inescapable bad dream.
REVIEW
Manolas is the most complete defender I've gone against in the first full year of FIFA Mobile. Whether there's a reset in a few months (or not), I'm hard pressed to think he'll be surpassed. Even if another centerback is inexplicably given the nod for August's Player of the Month or some kind of program elects to go with a CB, their boosts will be outrageous and their impact on your squad high, but I'm highly skeptical that player is capable of actually being better in-game than the Greek freak.
Multiple of my league mates who've played against me since echoed what I saw first hand against him -- those ridiculous slide tackles. The most frustrating is when you think you're in on goal and a seemingly dirty tackle dispossesses you and there's no free kick in sight. It's a waste of turn, time, and sanity -- and Manolas makes it look trivial. If you wanted a low-key reincarnation of the defensive ""glory days"" of FIFA Mobile's launch, Manolas is around the closest you'll get.
Besides his proficiency on the ground, I think what stood out most to me about the Roma defender was his closing speed. A few times Ultimate Team of the Season Lionel Messi would be on the cusp of breaking through for a clean look at goal only for Manolas to seemingly teleport across the box and either force a pass or change of possession altogether. Manolas also did this same act to stop a would be tap in on goal, echoing the one time his real life equivalent played Sweeper in a professional match. He uses the same 104 acceleration to close the gap as your RW or RM is initiating a Good or Great Chance. It's not very fun to face in all honesty.
In trying to rack my brain over a downside, I mean on paper, it has to be that he's not the attacking force Luiz or Ramos is? But outside of weird three-back throwback attacks in their own right, how often do either of those guys really get involved in attack in the majority of formations? In one 3-4-3 False 9 match -- which I was forced into due to my opponents' preset counters -- Manolas began a possesion on the wing and found the striker for an easy goal. That can't possibly happen too terribly often.
Luiz, I suppose, also is a dynamo at free kicks where as Manolas' 26 rating there ensures he's never going to have to direct a spot foul forward. No real loss in my estimation.
I guess -- and this is beyond grasping at straws -- one could elect to take umbrage that Futhead readers and FM community members neutered Manolas a bit by giving him +2 POS instead of any of three other more advantageous boosts? However, that seems like a bizarre  criticism to say the least when you consider it's sitting to the right of ""+1 OVR"".
Manolas' overall impact on your squad is noticable. The obvious overall boosts to your favorite formations aside, he puts you one step close to competing with the best of the best. And if FM turns out to be anything like its Madden Mobile counterpart, he increases your chances of packs, players, or who even knows if there's any kind of reset and subsequently if there are any kind of carry over rewards based on your previous squad strength. Neither of those things are bad certainly. 
This is unquantifiable and perhaps a bit psychosomatic, but my 11 seemed to just feel better with Manolas in it. One overall is seldom enough to be the be all end all difference head-to-head, but passsing felt smoother, shot angle selection seemed smarter, and I felt more confident launching the next VsA match than I did before. There's definitely value to that.
Finally, Manolas' header is an absolute thing of beauty. Whether from corners or clearing the ball defensively, the 6'2/189 cm defender played even bigger than he was. The 96 header rating no doubt plays a big part in that.
SUMMARY
If you're prone to being upset about luxury goods being quite good, you probably should've stopped reading a long time ago. If you're a FIFA Mobile elite squad possessor fortunate enough to be able to welcome Global Tour Program Legend Kostas Manolas into your fold, you're probably not regretting it right about now, steep price and all.
Manolas is the new gold standard at CB. Ramos' reign of terror is over. The king is dead. Long live the king."

After a brief one-day hiatus, fans of competitive FIFA will be buzzing for a second time this week as 64 new challengers -- now on PlayStation -- vie for the console's crown. German Xbox One player Michael 'Vfl Megabit' Bittner ousted Olympique Lyonnais French contender Fouad 'Rafsou' Fares, 7-5, Wednesday to win the opposite division.
While Xbox players have sort of established an unofficial dominance over their PS4 counterparts over the past year and a half (mainly by virtue of winning the majority of major competitions' finals), that does not mean the PlayStation side is to be taken lightly. The field is stacked with compeitors who have shone bright in past competitions. Manchester FUT Champions Cup runner-up Philipp 'Eisvogel' Schermer returns after yet another grand final loss in the FIFA eClub World Cup, but this time he will look to take home the prize after coming so close twice already.
FIFA Interactive World Cup runner-up and Manchester City player Kai 'Deto' Wollin continues his strong year after resurfacing in last year's final, and Barcelona FUT Champions Cup runner-up Nicolas 'nicolas99fc' Villalba returns as well. Former Madrid regional final winner Daniele 'Prinsipe' Paolucci -- coincidentally the only PS4 winner from six total regional finals -- will feature too.
The top 16 players from the PlayStation division will join the 16 Xbox competitors in the FIFA eWorld Cup held in London in August, so for most players, the goal is to make it past the group stages and win their first knockout round match. The rules are the same as they've been all year.
Every match between two players, including the Knockout Stage matches and the Grand Final, will be played over two legs. The player with the higher aggregate score will be declared the winner, but, if the scoreline remains tied after two games, extra-time and penalties will decide the winner.
During the group stage, the players will be seeded based on their qualifying results. What this means is that the No. 1 seed will play the No. 64 seed, and so on. After the first match based on the seedings, players will then be matched up against others with the same win-loss record. No player will face the same opponent twice before the Knockouts. The competitors will have the chance to play up to seven matches in the Group Stage, or 14 games in total. Four wins from seven matches will ensure entry into the Knockout rounds, but if a player loses four matches, they will immediately be eliminated from the competition.
The Knockout Stage is relatively simple. The 32 remaining players will be seeded into a single-elimination bracket based on their win-loss record from the Group Stage. At the end, only two players will remain, and they will go on to play each other for events' highest cash prize. Unlike previous tournaments, there won't be a cross-console match as all the competitors hail from the PS4 side of things.
The tournament will kick-off Friday at 7:40 a.m. ET (12:40 p.m. UK time) with the first five rounds of the group stage. The broadcast crew will be back for 'Qualification Saturday' at 6 a.m. ET for the last two rounds of the group stages and the first knockout round, while the rest is scheduled to finish out Sunday starting at 6 a.m. ET as well. For a more fleshed-out look at the entire weekend's schedule, you can go here. Extended coverage and behind-the-scenes action can be found on Twitch."

If you're one of the 1% of smart phone users who owns a Windows Phone (and one of the even smaller percentage of that 1% that play FIFA Mobile on it), we've got bad news.
FIFA Mobile announced Tuesday evening they'd no longer be supporting the game on the Windows Phone OS:

This can't come as much of a surprise to the users of the platform. The game's had reported issues with Live Events for some time and with the FIFA Mobile team seeming to be running into challenges supporting the platform the same way they do iOS and Android devices, it probably makes more sense to focus 100% of their times and efforts there.
The silver lining is that Windows Phone users should be able to reclaim all their player data by simply logging into their account on an Android or iOS device ... before November 7. It appears at that time, FIFA Mobile will cease operating for Windows Phone users.
Best of luck to FM enthusiasts on Windows Phones. If you ever needed an excuse to switch, now may be the time."

The last big dance for the Premier League during FIFA 18 Ultimate Team's weekly Team of the Week drop is upon us.
With the domestic season a wrap -- congrats to ""Centurions"" Manchester City on their record-smashing 100-point season -- PL players will likely only be included over the offseason for their contributions internationally.
While a few of the so-called ""Big Five"" domestic leagues (Italy most notably) have multiple fixtures to go, we've reached the tail-end of when these annual releases trend towards the respectable. May as well have our fun while we can before we get full MLS and Russian League sides.
Leading the group isn't a technical member of the 23 but rather a special item for an even more special campaign: Liverpool's breakout superstar Mohamed Salah bested the Premier League goals scored in a single campaign mark, and for it he gets a sexy blue and red item to close out the 17/18 season. His Ones to Watch item gets its last boost of the game as well (RIP).
Amongst the side proper, 92 TIF Gareth Bale is the biggest head turner in what is expected to be his last special item (pending a possible UCL Final MOTM, one would suppose) until August. With Wales missing out on WC qualification, the electric winger will have to settle for this 92-overall item, at least for the next couple months.
As we're wont to do, our sleeper of the week is relatively brief Middlesbrough player Martin Braithwaite. His latest in-form, a very solid looking 84-overall striker, now for FC Girondins de Bordeaux, may have its complications chemistry-wise, but maybe you can be creative and add him to your Ligue 1 TOTS, uh, TOTS Eriksen hybrids?
Here's the full FUT 18 Ultimate Team Team of the Week 35:"

Last Week's score: 9/18
Squad Link: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7605059/
Formation: 3-4-1-2

Goalkeeper
Yaroslav Godzyur - GK - 70 OVR
I am not overly confident on either of the keepers this week but both selected make a case for being included. The first is Ural's stopper, Godzyur who made a total of nine saves before conceding in the final moments of the game. Ural did come away with a point  although it does limit Godzyur's chances of being selected.
Defenders
Domenico Criscito - LB - 79 OVR
Criscito has been on the fringe of several sides recently and could be due to finally make the cut after another top performance this weekend. Zenit won by the convincing score line of 5-1 with Criscito scoring once alongside causing the OG.
Jemerson - CB - 77 OVR
Monaco opened Ligue 1 proceedings with a closely fought 3-2 home win. Both central defenders found themselves on the scoresheet however it was Jemerson with the higher L'equipe rating and for that reason he becomes a clear favourite. There are other options from different games but Jemerson makes a strong case.
Andreas Ulmer - LB - 73 OVR
I have selected Ulmer largely because he is gold with a SIF, although he did record two assists which is good for a defender conceding against a newly promoted side does not bide well. Despite that he could easily make the cut for what it looks like on paper and thus I have ended up selecting him.
Midfielders
Gelson Martins - RM - 80 OVR
The Portuguese league was another which started this week and Martins started where he left the last with another brilliant performance. The winger scored both Sporting goals as they recorded a 2-0 away win over Aves.
Clint Dempsey - CAM - 79 OVR
Dempsey was not selected for the MLS All star game and because of that he is able to appear in this side. The American played in a role behind the striker and scored two alongside picking up an assist in Seattle's 4-0 away win over Minnesota
Nabil Fekir - CAM - 81 OVR
I am sure that Lyon will be picking up an IF after their 4-0 home win on Saturday. As to who that will be comes down to one of two players, both who received 7/10 from L'equipe and both scored twice. I have gone for Fekir over Diaz for the fact that he is gold over silver and that he played in a deeper position.
Carlos Sanchez - RM - 79 OVR
Monterrey is another game of which two potential options appeared from. Once again the margins are small when deciding between them. Sanchez scored once and assisted another two while Hurtardo scored twice. Either one could make the cut but I feel that Sanchez edges it.
Forwards
Jonathas - ST - 78 OVR
Kazan continue to impress over the past few years and with a 2-1 away win over CSKA this weekend they could well compete once again. It was their Brazilian striker, Jonathas who scored both the goals and thus claims his spot in the side.
Bobby Reid - ST - 66 OVR
Reid played in a more offensive ST role to start Bristol's Npower campaign and he well and truly delivered, scoring two of his own alongside picking up an assist in their 3-1 home win over Barnsley. Fan favourite Bendtner is the other option but with an average match rating he really is 50/50.
Leigh Griffiths - ST - 75 OVR
I don’t quite understand these IF's as they are almost identical to previous SBC items but considering that we have seen it several times in the past I am sure we can see it again. Griffith was out of favour a lot of last season but with transfers going his way he looks to be getting more chances. He took his chance well scoring twice in Celtic's 4-1 win.
Substitutes
Paul Bernardoni - GK - 68 OVR
There were no stand out keepers this week bar arguably Wallsall's stopper but considering that his side lost I can't see him making it. Bernardoni made a total of five saves, one of which was a penalty. His side went on to win 1-0 and thus he becomes a viable option.
Patrick Doody - LB - 56 OVR
When a defender is involved in two goals he often has a high chance of being selected. Doody went one better though and recorded three assists for Chicago Fire in their 4-1 home win. Despite conceding once the fact he has three assists is not going to be overlooked.
Jodi Jones - LM - 65 OVR
Coventry started their season with three points via a comfortable 3-0 home win. Jones was the unquestionably the star man, scoring all three of said goals from a wide midfield position. There’s no doubt surrounding his position in this side.
Clinton N'Jie - LM - 70 OVR
With the score at 0-0 when the sides went in at HT Marseille decided to change things around by bringing N'Jie on. That turned out to be the changing point in the game scoring two of their three goals in order to claim a comfortable 3-0 win. The winger picked up player of the week for doing so with a 8/10.
Steven Skrzybski - ST - 67 OVR
Skrzybski picked up player of the week in Germanys second division after scoring twice and assisting another. Due to this it does look as though Kreilach who picked up a goal and two assists in the same game will miss out. Union Berlin went on to win the match 4-3
Johan Oremo - ST - 65 OVR
By far the hardest call of the week comes with which Swedish striker to select. Oremo, Abasi and Jebali all performed to a top standard and I fully expect one if not two to feature in this side. I ended up selected Oremo as his brace and assist didn't involve a penalty alongside the fact that his score line was the biggest at 6-1.
James Collins - ST - 66 OVR
The opening day of the season is often a nervous affair although that was anything but the case for Luton who managed to knock a colossal eight past Yeovil in a demoralising 8-2 win. Collins was involved in four of those goals notching three of his own alongside teeing up another."

A.C. Milan have been one of the biggest spenders in this summer transfer window and have completely revamped their roster for the 2017-18 season.
The Red and Blacks have already signed striker André Silva, center back Mateo Musacchio, left back Ricardo Rodriguez, forward Fabio Borini, central midfielder Franck Kessié (two-year loan with a mandate to buy) and most recently midfielder Hakan Çalhanoğlu and right back Andrea Conti. We don't know how the Gianluigi Donnarumma saga will end, but Milan appear to have surrounded their phenom goalkeeper with a plethora of talent.
Their spending spree should make them one of the top teams in Serie A again, but it also completely re-shapes the FUT landscape in the Calcio.
While the lot of players should likely result in a potential Ones To Watch item or two for Milan, Rodriguez's transfer is certainly noteworthy for FUT players looking ahead at what their Calcio A squad could look like next season. Rodriguez has been one of the better LB options in the Bundesliga this season for Wolfsburg and the LB pool in ""Calcio A"" was thin this season beyond Juventus’ Alex Sandro.
With transfer rumors swirling about Sandro and linking him with a £60m move to Chelsea, Rodriguez could potentially become even the top option for players in FIFA 18. 
Conti, a young Italian RB, could fill a similar role on your FIFA 18 FUT squad as Rodriguez. With Dani Alves' departure from Juventus, the RB pool is thin in the Calcio with Roma's Bruno Peres and not much beneath him. Conti was a bit of a fan favorite in FIFA 17, getting a Silver TOTS item in the Silver Community Most Consistent Without an Inform TOTS, so he may see a Gold item at FIFA 18's launch.
Calcio A doesn’t have many solid, lower-tier central backs in this year’s game but Matteo Musacchio could change that next season. The former Villarreal defender’s 83 rated gold item makes for an affordable alternative to the premium CBs like Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci, and Kalidou Koulibaly.
We saw Andre Silva’s Milan debut in FUT this week with his IMOTM item, so FIFA 17 players can already enjoy Silva and his Milan chemistry in this year’s game. Pairing Silva with Borini up top could be a great early season FUT duo in FIFA 18.
It will be interesting to see what position Çalhanoğlu plays for Milan next season and what item he will be given at launch. He was one of the more forgotten players entering the transfer window after not appearing in a match for Bayer Leverkusen since January while serving a FIFA imposed ban for receiving €100,000 from Turkish club Trabzonspor in 2011. 
In FIFA 17, his Gold and Scream items were at CAM but his IF and SIF have him playing on the left. A Çalhanoğlu CAM item in Calcio A would give the position some needed depth, and his free kicks make him a desirable option in any squad.
A LM item makes him less likely to crack your Calcio A squad with players like Lorenzo Insigne, Dries Mertens, and maybe even Stephan El Shaarawy serving as sexier LM/LW possibilities. 
Milan’s spending spree will certainly give players much more squad optionality in FIFA 18."

It all gets underway with everyone in the game getting a free 85 Marcel De Jong of Vancouver Whitecaps FC. All 10 other players, including 95-overall rated CDM Atiba Hutchinson, are tradeable and every Canada Day promo pack guarantees a player. The items sport one boost that only goes to other Canadians and a second which boost all.

To the surprise of absolutely no one, the FIFA 18 coverboy is the game's highest rated player. That's right. Cristiano Ronaldo has done it again. The reigning FIFA World Player of the Year maintains his 94 overall rating and his title as best player in the game. While the real life debate may rage on, in FIFA's eyes, Ronaldo is the best in the world. 
Staying the course seems to be the theme for the elite players this year as Lionel Messi also keeps the same 93 rating he possessed in the previous game. 
Rounding out the Top 5 it's much of the same. Luis Suarez, Neymar and Manuel Neuer all keep their 92 ratings from FIFA 17. The only thing that changes with these three is that Neymar is now the highest rated player in Ligue 1 instead of in the shadow of the two best players in the game. Will we see a sesmic shift to Ligue 1 squads and hybrids this year or will we see less of the tricky Brazilian? 
Finally we see a change in the Top 10 at the No. 6 spot as Bayern Munich's talisman, Robert Lewandowski, gets an overall rating up of one point to become the second highest rated striker in the game. 
Two of the biggest movers into this distinguished list are Eden Hazard and Toni Kroos. Both were rated 88 in FIFA 17 but have seen their overalls get a nice little bump of two thanks to great individual seasons. Kroos helped Real Madrid to the league and european double, while Hazard starred in Chelsea's title-winning season. 
Sergio Ramos and Gonzalo Higuain complete the final 10. Ramos receives a small bump from 89 to 90, while Higuain capitalizes on a monster season for Juventus to get a jump from 88 to 90."

With Aarong222 away on vacation, I am taking over the responsibility of the TOTW prediction for this week.
With the majority of big leagues having ended, expect a side dominated by the MLS and Turkish Super Lig, before the final good TOTW next week with the International matchups. 
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad Link: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/6731144/

Goalkeeper
Bill Hamid - GK - 76 OVR
After missing out last week, I believe that the D.C. United keeper will pick up an In Form this week, after he made 6 saves to help his side to a respectable 0-0 draw against the L.A. Galaxy.
Defenders
Kendall Waston - CB - 74 OVR
You can tell it’s a poor week when there is a silver player in the Starting XI, but that is the time of year we have now come to. The Costa Rican defender scored twice as the Vancouver Whitecaps won 3-1 against Atlanta United.
Ike Opara - CB - 72 OVR
FUT favourite Opara looks set to keep up his record of an IF in each of the last 3 years, after he scored a great long range goal against league newcomers Minnesota United, helping Seattle Sounders get back to winning ways, after 2 consecutive losses, with a 3-0 win.
Renato Civelli - CB - 78 OVR
Banfield kept hold of their slim title hopes with a 2-1 win over Gimnasia La Playa. Civelli makes my prediction as he scored the first goal of the match, and is the only real gold option this week.
Midfielders
Justin Meram - LM - 70 OVR
The Iraqi international was involved in two of Columbus Crew’s goals in their midweek win over Seattle Sounders. He scored the second and assisted the third as the game finished 3-1.
Diego Valeri - CAM - 79 OVR
The first of what I expect will be a few In Forms for the Portland Timbers playmaker. He scored both goals as the Timbers overcame the San Jose Earthquakes 2-0.
Yoric Ravet - CAM - 75 OVR
The first TOTS Most Consistent player to get an In Form this year is Ravet of Young Boys. Playing in a more central role than normal, he scored both goals in their 2-0 win over Lausanne.
Aatif Chahechouhe - LW - 77 OVR
A rather disappointing season for Fenerbahce had a bit of a silver lining, as they finished above bitter rivals Galatasaray. Their Moroccan winger was the main reason behind that, as he set up one and scored another in their 3-1 win over the already relegated Adanaspor.
Forwards
Dario Benedetto - ST - 76 OVR
Boca Juniors extended their lead at the top of the table thanks to a brace from Benedetto. His goals helped Boca to a comfortable 3-0 win over Independiente.
Dayro Moreno - ST - 77 OVR
A FIFA 14 favourite, Moreno was in good form for Atlético Nacional, scoring a total of three and assisting one in both rounds of their playoff quarter final win over Jaguares.
Cenk Tosun - ST - 78 OVR
After he received his TOTS last week, it may be too soon for him to receive an In Form, but with 2 goals and an assist, I can’t ignore him. His performance capped off an excellent season for Beşiktaş, winning 4-0 on the day and making their title win from the previous week even better.
Substitutes
César Rigamonti - GK - 67 OVR
The only thing that may prevent Rigamonti from getting in is that his game was midweek, but with 10 saves including a couple of incredible ones, he receive widespread acclaim for his performance as he single-handedly gave Quilmes a 0-0 draw against Velez Sarsfield.
Mickail Facchinetti - LB - 64 OVR
Thun ended the season on a high with a 3-1 win against Vaduz. Facchinetti set up two of their goals, making him a solid candidate for the TOTW.
Sinan Gümüş - RM - 72 OVR
He may only be a bit-part player for Galatasaray, but he has been in excellent for in the past few weeks, scoring 5 goals in his last 3 games, including 2 this week to help Gala to a 2-1 win over Konyaspor.
Fabian Sambueza - RM - 72 OVR
Deportivo Cali may have pushed their luck a bit in their playoff quarter final, but they made it through, mainly due to Sambueza’s goals. He scored twice to help them to a 4-1 win.
Pablo Batalla - CAM - 79 OVR
I have taken a punt with the Bursaspor midfielder, but I believe he has a valid claim for a spot. He scored the winning goal in their 2-1 win over Trabzonspor - a result which ended a 6 game run without a win and, more importantly, helped avoid relegation.
Saman Ghoddos - ST - 67 OVR
Östersunds kept their good start to the season going thanks to a 3-1 win over Sundsvall. Ghoddos was their star performer, scoring the first two goals in the match.
Alfredo Morelos - ST - 65 OVR
Another TOTS Most Consistent player to receive an In Form this week is Finnish side HJK’s striker Morelos. The Colombian scored two and set up three other goals in an incredible performance which helped his side to a 6-0 win, then scoring again in their 4-1 win on Sunday night.
Reserves
Rafał Murawski - CDM - 71 OVR
Pogoń Szczecin ended their season with a solid 3-0 victory over Korona Kielce. Veteran midfielder Murawski played a part in all three goals, scoring twice and assisting the other.
Michael Barrios - RM - 71 OVR
Barrios may not have been the star of the show for Dallas, but as their hattrick hero Lamah is not in the game, I have opted to include Barrios, who made a hattrick of assists as Dallas won 6-2 over Real Salt Lake.
Jean Armel Drolé  - RM - 63 OVR
Antalyaspor ended the season on a high with a 4-1 win over Gaziantepspor, with Ivory Coast winger Drolé scoring twice, in what was his first start for the club.
Kengo Kawamata - ST - 62 OVR
Júbilo Iwata’s Kawamata was their key man, as they surprised Gamba Osaso. Kawamata scored assisted once before scoring twice in a 3-0 win.
Sean Maguire - ST - 62 OVR
Another TOTS Most Consistent player to get an In Form is Sean Maguire. In what proved to be his last game for Cork City, he scored all three goals to lead them to a 3-0 win."

                        A rough night for EA and for FIFA 18...
                    

This is the second year now that EA have broken away from the E3 conference pack, again opting to do their own thing, at their own venue, in their own way. And if you cast your mind back to last year’s EA Play, that was the core rationale behind the whole move; control. 
And last year it definitely paid off. EA weren’t hamstrung by the strict E3 conference timings, and were instead able to give their entire suite of games, from shooting to sports relevant and deserved air time. Which after such a successful first year, is why I was incredibly disappointed to see the show slide back towards the chaotic hit and miss formula of past E3’s. 
First and foremost we’re here to talk about FIFA which apart from an extended look at the teaser trailer, failed to gain any additional momentum after the big 'Ronaldo's' reveal earlier in the week. EA trotted out their favourite duo the Men in Blazers who did an okay, if at times awkward job of relaying the changes made to FIFA 18. I’m a firm believer that the spotlight on day’s like this should belong to the devs and producers, who have a much better chance of delivering a passionate and compelling overview of the product. The Men in Blazers sadly conveyed neither. 
Then there was the first look at The Journey which see’s the return of Alex Hunter for a second season, and a big decision looming about his next destination. Whilst impressive, last night’s Journey trailer was strikingly similar to last year’s cutscened fuelled overview and again it failed to convey concrete feature changes. Perhaps that’s all to come, but anyone who played The Journey to completion last year will be very keen to know about the nuts and bolts of how the gameplay elements are going to improve. Because if anything let The Journey's story driven experience down in FIFA 17, it was the gameplay.
And this style over substance approach continued through EA’s portfolio of games, with the sports scene suffering the most. There was a jazzy trailer for Madden’s Journey-esg ‘Long Shot’ and the same for NBA’s ‘The One’. But the time devs actually stood on stage and talked about their work was miniscule. The 30 second NBA demo of a Lebron dunk they’d “literally just captured” (yeah, sure…) was painfully put together but that said, at least we saw some actually NBA gameplay on screen. A luxury not afforded to FIFA. 
Away from sports there was the all new A Way Out, for which the couch co-op elements really captured the imagination of how two interlinking stories could operate on the same screen. However, even that was tinged with some cheesey “slap this guy on the head, it wasn’t me it was him!” scenarios presented as puzzle solving opportunities. Perhaps slapstick is what they're going for, but for me it ever so slightly took the shine off an admittedly interesting concept. 
Then there was Need For Speed Payback which for some unknown reason EA are continuing to push a narrative driven, Fast and Furious style experience. Rather than just letting us bloody race! I’m a huge NFS fan throughout the modern console era, but Hot Pursuit in 2010 was the last time they really nailed it. Fast, frenetic, blood pumping racing with some incredibly fun challenges, a big roster of exotic cars and not a story thread to be found. Glorious. 
Even EA’s newest and most mysterious IP Anthem only got the tiniest of teasers, with EA then pointing everyone towards the Microsoft conference for the full reveal the day after. It was a confusing move to say the least, and it felt like another missed opportunity to land a killer punch in a conference which was at the time very much on the ropes. I guess we'll see if Anthem can deliver anything beyond a Destiny/Titanfall hybrid later today. 
The stars of the show were undoubtedly EA’s shooters with a new Battlefield 1 expansion and the all-new Battlefront 2 both looking absolutely fantastic. But at this point EA Play became even more lopsided with over half an hour of the 90-or-so minute conference dedicated solely to Battlefront 2. Which don’t get me wrong looked incredible, but it felt odd to spend time running a live multiplayer match mid-conference, when so many other games like FIFA were squeezed. Surely that would have been much better off as a “stick around after the show for a live Battlefront 2 stream” type thing? 
As I’m sure you will have read in Tom’s previews of FIFA 18’s gameplay and Journey mode, there is actually some meat to the bones of these announcements, but none of it came across at EA Play, which was disappointing to say the least. As I wrote earlier this week, FIFA 18 got off to an absolutely storming start with the reveal of R9 and Icon’s coming to all platforms. But it kind of feels like EA have perhaps blown their load a bit soon? As they were left scrambling to fill even the smallest of FIFA 18 time slots last night. 
As i’ve discussed above, the critique of EA Play this year isn't solely about FIFA, as I felt EA sold their entire line-up (excluding Battlefront 2) pretty poorly, and the lack of devs on stage was a big concern for me, because as fans of the games they’re the people we want to hear from, not the guys from the big offices upstairs. And given that the whole point of EA Play is to free EA up to do whatever they want, I was sad to see a disjointed, and disconnected set of reveals.

There’s a long way to go yet until September 29th, but after the bombastic start to life FIFA 18 experienced, I think we were probably all expecting a whole lot more from EA Play than we actually got."

After competing at the top of the leaderboard since the beginning of the new Versus Attack Mode (VsA), a twitter community favourite has finally earned their on Team of the Week.
FM Indonesia's 'MooPiCait' didn't quite managed to top the leaderboard, with previous cTOTW winner Hunterkiller having jumped into first place shortly before the end of the season, but finishing in second place is enough to see MooPiCait take home the honour of a cTOTW based around their team.
With this month seemingly following the format of the original Team of the Week and Player of the Month releases, you will need all four of the 'Player of the Month' tokens to complete the eventual Player of the Month plan rather than the 200 elite trophies required to complete the June version of the cTOTW plan.
As usual, the players will be in packs for a week commencing Thursday 13th at 8 p.m. ET (1 a.m BST), with live events expected on the release day and once again later in the week for you to try and complete before the plan.
The plan is available for you to check out, along with each players in game item with stats for you to look over:

83 LWB Emil Forsberg
91 CB David Luiz
82 CB Atiba Hutchinson

We've been waiting for a big, overpowered trio of FIFA Mobile 'Retro Stars' for a couple weeks now. And while last week's was nice and tasty in its own right, tonight's really takes the cake. 
Those clamoring for an upgrade to Flash Freeze Aubameyang or Out of Position Dries Mertens have been granted their wish: Aubameyang is now a 92 rated CF while Mertens is a whopping 96-overall LF. GG, EA FIFA Mobile live team!
This week's Master is a doozy too. After an emphatic debut this past weekend at Old Trafford, Manchester United striker Romelu Lukaku gets a 99-overall item (upgraded from his 97 Lunar New Year Master item), with some appropriate boosts to match. If you've been saving up Lunar New Year tokens, you're going to have a real good time this week.
These Retro Star plans are available until next Tuesday with live events tonight and over the weekend as well.
All new player items and plans should be on Futhead later this evening."

Another week of international tuneups for next Summer's World Cup means more orange collectible high-rated International Man of the Match items.
Including Armindo Tué Na Bangna, better known as Bruma's first RB Leipzig card, these new iMOTMs will be in packs from now until Friday, July 7 at 7 p.m. ET (midnight July 8 BST).
Claudio Bravo may not have had a season to remember, but his best card of FUT 17 may just be the difference maker you need to make the next level up in the Weekend League. If you can get past his 6'0 height, it's a very decent looking 87-overall rated item.
Rising Atlético Madrid star Saúl Ñíguez Esclápez's Spain couldn't quite capture the U21 European championship, but his hat-trick in the semifinals gets him his respective best release this year to point. Probably safe to bet Saúl will do a little bit better than 80-overall in FIFA 18.
Be sure to check out all the latest International Man of the Match items in the Latest item section."

One of the feel good stories of EURO 2016 is at long last making their way to FIFA.
Per The Football Association of Iceland, EA and the association have agreed on an arrangement that will bring Gylfi Sigurðsson and the Icelandic men's national team to FIFA 18. As some may recall, the two parties couldn't come to terms a year ago, culminating in Iceland being left out of FIFA 17.
""I am very happy with this result and consider it good news for everyone that plays the game in Iceland, and really around the world,"" KSÍ chairman Guðni Bergsson said in a statement. ""I think this is very good marketing for Icelandic football, fun for our supporters, and of course, the players themselves.""
The KSÍ added that a special edition of the game only available in Iceland would be for sale beginning September 29. It will showcase a custom cover featuring the national team's badge."

The former Netherlands international received this item to commemorate the end of a 19-year career, which saw him play for the likes of Utrecht, Feyenoord, Fenerbahce, and most famously, Liverpool. He signed off his career with a hat-trick in his last game, which secured the title for Feyenoord, and cemented his legendary status."

In need of a cheap La Liga Santander center back? Look no further than Las Palmas defender Mauricio Lemos. The 77-rated gold center back took a  rating decrease from FIFA 17 to FIFA 18, but it could actually work in our favor. Lemos dropped from a rare 80-overall centerback to his now non-rare form. This drop has made his perceived value decrease, and thus his price, giving you all of the more reason to consider trying him out. 

IN-GAME STATS
At first glance, Lemos' main stats do not scream anything special. His pace is average at best at 70; his dribbling is high for a defender at 7;, and his shooting and passing remain in the mid to high 50s. His defending, however (78) and physical (74), are intriguing for his price point. 
In the interest of keeping things with cost in mind, I opted not to use a chemistry style: 
SQUADS
I used Lemos in a variety of teams and formations, eventually landing on the simple and popular 4-4-2. Due to this strong right foot, I played him at right center back. 
My squad with Lemos:

STATS
I used Lemos for 23 matches. Here were his stats for those games:
Price:  350
Games: 23
Goals: 5
Assists: 1
Now the review itself:
REVIEW
Pace: 6/10
Compared to other non-rare center backs, Lemos' pace is merely adequate. He is not the fastest player in the world, but he mostly gets the job done. When playing against the likes of Sadio Mane and Antoine Griezmann, he can get burned easily. But can he win in a foot race against an Oliver Giroud type? You bet he can.
Dribbling: 3/10
His card does say he has 70 dribbling but I have yet to progress meaningfully out of the center back position. Dribbling in your own defensive third extensively can be a death sentence in FIFA and should probably be avoided. Lemos can control a pass and is able to take a few touches before passing. That is honestly usually all you need out of your center backs. 
Shooting: 6/10
Despite his shooting only being 54, Lemos has surprisingly impressive power. I'm prone to take the occasional long shot from him if he's up on a set piece, which more times than note results in a corner kick. On corner kicks though is where he shines. If you play a ball to Lemos near post, he's got a good chance to head it in. Every goal he has scored for me has been off of a corner kick.
Passing: 6/10
His passing is what it is. He has never botched a simple pass but his vision is only a 44 and his crossing is 50. He makes up his passing by having 61 long passing, which feels even higher than that. His ability to send wingers into the corner might even be a bit under appreciated if we're being honest.
Defending: 9/10
Lemos' defensive ability for his price point however is near second to none. He clobbers any opponent dribbling his way, he wins every aerial duel, and stops attackers in their tracks. His big frame covers a ton of ground and he is able to stop counter attacks before fruition. Despite average ratings, he really shines when the pressure is on.
Physical: 8/10
For what Lemos lacks in pace, he makes up for in brute size and strength. There has been many times when he has oddly flipped a player after a tackle. Every other game it seems as if he has injured a player on the opposing team. It was rare to see a player out dribble him because he'll throw his body on the attacker and shake them off. 
SUMMARY
It may seem a bit of a surprise, but I honestly recommend you buy this item if you're hard for coins. He is cheap and very effective in game. On the outside, he may look like another cheap non-rare Gold center back. But once you start to use him, you might even be thrown for quite a ride. Even after upgrading my La Liga side with higher rated rare golds, he remains in the mix for a starting spot."

It all comes down to this.
In a little more than three hours, we'll unveil first on Twitter the results of our 100% community-powered TOTY vote. Over 77,000 strong FUT partisans have made their voices heard. But it's not too late.
With only a few more hours to spare, one of our positional contests is still extremely in play. It's our closest race by far.
If you have any friends, any coworkers, any people who've said awful, unspeakable things to you on Xbox Live who haven't voted yet, make sure they get this link: http://www.futhead.com/toty/vote
Though you can only vote once, we want as many members of the FIFA and football communities to have a say and ensure democracy has its day as we move away from the FIFPro World XI to this exciting new model.
We've had a blast doing this and hope you've enjoyed the fun too. Let's close out strong and get ready for the best to come in-game next week.
Here's the XI (shown by positional group alphabetically) with voting to close at 7 p.m. UK time Thursday, January 11:

Last week's easy fixtures seemed almost too good to be true, but a late Celta Vigo equaliser spoiled an almost perfect week last time round. Let's hope we can match 3/4 in what is a far tougher week to predict.
The Bundesliga is back in action after its winter break, and it's got some excellent matches which feature in our four games to prediction this week. 

Bayer Leverkusen v Bayern Munich
Fourth host first in the game that kicks off the Rückrunde on Friday. 
Hosts Leverkusen will be hoping to pick up a win to let them keep near the top of the teams chasing the second two automatic Champions League qualification spots, with 10 teams separated by just seven points. They come into the game having not lost since round 5 of the Hinrunde in September - a 16 run streak in all competitions. 
Bayern are in even better form than their opponents, winning 16 of their previous 17 matches in all competitions - a 2-1 loss to Monchengladbach. They are still without key players such as Neuer, Thiago and possibly Hummels as well, but that hasn't proven to be any form of obstacle before the winter break so I doubt it will be now.
Leverkusen away has proven a very tough match for Bayern in recent years, with their last win in normal time coming back in March 2013. Since then, Bayern have won on penalties in the Pokal after a 0-0 draw in extra time, drawn 4 and lost 1, with 3 of the last 4 games being 0-0 draws. I can see this game being very close, with very little between the sides but Bayern edging the win by a single goal.
Game time: Friday 12th, 7:30 p.m. (GMT) / 2:30 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Bayern Munich win

Sheffield United v Sheffield Wednesday
The Sheffield derby means that we will know half of the results on Friday night, and have the chance to see the team lineups before we even predict the result. United are pretty clear favourites, currently sitting one point off the playoff spots compared to their rivals who are sitting in the lower-mid table. 
In recent games, they are very even, with two wins each and three draws in the past seven matches, so there is very little to separate the sides. Neither side is in great form, with United having won twice, compared to Wednesday’s once, with both sides losing five games in their previous 10. I feel like United are most likely to win this game with home advantage along with Wednesday suffering a lot of injuries to key players. 
Game time: Friday 12th, 7:45 p.m. (GMT) / 2:45 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Sheffield United win

RB Leipzig v Schalke
Another close match in the Bundesliga is second place Schalke against fifth place Leipzig. Schalke had an excellent run of form which saw them go unbeaten from September, drawing six and winning seven in that time. 
Leipzig were keeping Bayern on their toes for a large part of the season, but a poor run just before the winter break where they only gained 2 points from 12 has seen them drop down to fifth in the table. They are just two points behind Schalke, and five ahead of 11th in the table so a win is essential for both teams to get off on the right foot for the start of the Rückrunde. 
Schalke are hoping to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in four seasons, and have got themselves into a good position to be able to do that. With playmaker Goretzka out injured, they may have lost a lot of their midfield creativity, so they may struggle a bit more than usual.
Schalke have a slight head to head advantage with two wins compared to Leipzig’s one, but Leipzig with home advantage and Schalke without Goretzka makes me think that a draw is the most likely result 
Game time: Saturday 13th, 5:30 p.m. (GMT) / 12:30 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw

Liverpool v Manchester City
This game will be a very interesting one for a few reasons. Firstly, Liverpool are adapting to life without Coutinho, and life with a proper centre back in Virgil Van Dijk. It also provides what could possibly be Manchester City’s biggest challenge of the season so far, as they face a team in excellent form who are just as dangerous going forward as City are.
Liverpool seem to have sorted out their defensive problems with the addition of Van Dijk, who became an instant hero for scoring a late winner over Everton in the Cup last weekend. Having hoefully sorted out their defensive problems, the hosts will be hoping that Salah, Mane and Firmino can continue their recent form to minimise the impact of losing Coutinho. 
Manchester City rested several of their regular starting XI for their midweek cup semifinal against Bristol City, but with De Bruyne, Sterling, Sane and Stones all playing the full 90 minutes, and Aguero having to be brought on and then score a late winner, they may not be fully rested and ready for what will surely be a very high tempo match.
City won the first game between these sides this season 5-0, but Liverpool have got a definite advantage in recent years against City - winning five of the last 10 matches compared to City’s two. Salah has only just returned from injury, so his fitness will no doubt play a big part in the match along with how well City’s key players have recuperated, but it will be a close game.
Game time: Sunday 14th, 4:00 p.m. (GMT) / 11:00 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw

Four very close and tough games to predict this week, but that’s what I think will happen. Let us know how you are predicting in the comments below or on Twitter. Good luck!"

Last week's score: 15/18
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad Link: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7132352/

Goalkeeper
Esteban Andrada - GK - 69 OVR
I was wrong with my Argentine keeper selection last week, but I would be shocked if the same mistake was made again. Although Lanus drew the match 1-1, meaning Andrada did concede in a match he didn't win, he was outstanding overall. Making a total of ten saves (which includes a penalty), it is clear to see just how pivotal his role in the draw was. Without him the score would have been significantly worse.
Defenders
Alexander Callens - CB - 73 OVR
When it comes to possible incorrect picks, I expect those to fall on the defensive side this week with the options being limited, to say the least. Alexander Callens makes an appearance thanks to his goal in NYFC's 3-1 home win and although he was not Man of the Match, I can't see another David Villa inform, especially for just one goal.
Jonatan Tollas Nation - CB - 68 OVR
As far as punts go, this is a big one. Jonatan Tollas Nation picked up MOTM in Valerenga's 0-0 away draw, and although it was not a special match rating, the fact that he picked up MOTM alongside no real Tippeligaen options means he could sneak in.
Matt Polster - RB - 67 OVR
In terms of FIFA, this one won't exactly be the best of items. But after Matt Polster assisted two of Chicago Fire's four goals and helped to keep a clean sheet in an unusual RB role, it's hard not to select him for the side.
Midfielders
Hector Villalba - RM - 74 OVR
The MLS-heavy TOTW trend is likely to continue after there were plenty of options once again this week. And with performances like Villalba's, it honestly has every right to be that way. The young Argentine scored both Atlanta United's goals in their 2-0 win away at Columbus Crew, which sees them climb to fifth in the table.
Blerim Dzemaili - CAM - 74 OVR
Blerim Dzemaili was snubbed a couple of weeks ago, despite being gold, but with him being the best option from his match, his chances of making the cut are significantly higher this time around. The Swiss midfielder scored one and assisted another in Montreal Impact's 2-0 win over DC United.
Yoshimar Yotun - LM - 68 OVR
Malmo returned where they left off with another three points to their name, courtesy of a 3-2 win. Yoshimar Yotun was the standout player, picking up both a goal and an assist. He received a lot of plaudits for his work to boot.
Yu Kobayashi - RM - 70 OVR
The first of two Kawasaki players to make the cut this week comes in Yu Kobayashi, who was involved in three of their five goals. He picked up two of his own to go alongside an assist.
Forwards
Lee Dong Gook - ST - 75 OVR
Lee Dong Gook has been the face of the so-called ""Team of the Weak"" for many years now, and after just two of the said teams, he looks to be making an appearance this week. The Korean scored twice for Jeonbuk on Wednesday (which although is early they counted last week) in a convincing 3-1 away win over Pohang.
Yeom Ki Hun - ST - 75 OVR
Another Korean league player from another Wednesday fixture; risky, but with the lack of games being played once again, it really should happen. Yeom Ki Hun played a more advanced role for Bluewings and rewarded them by being involved in all three of their goals: one goal and two assists in the 3-0 win.
Nemanja Nikolic - ST - 75 OVR
Nemanja Nikolic makes it three gold strikers in the side for his contribution of two goals and an assist during Chicago Fire's convincing 4-0 home win over Vancouver. Although he didnt pick up MOTM, I still see him as the strongest option from the game.
Substitutes
Anders Kristiansen - GK - 59 OVR
We haven't seen many bronze keepers at all this year, thanks to the change of format mainly, but these weeks are when they should finally appear. Anders Kristiansen makes a good shout to become one after making a total of 5 saves and picked up MOTM in a 0-0 away draw away at odd.
Ryosuke Yamananaka - LB - 64 OVR
Unlike last week, defenders were significantly harder to select, which in turn makes it that much harder to achieve a higher number of correct picks. Yamananaka is a punt, but after he scored what turned out to be the winning goal in his side's 2-1 win and also appeared in the J-League TOTW, he is a viable option.
Gabriel Somi - LM - 62 OVR
Although Osterunds failed to win their match, thanks to a brace from Gabriel Somi, they didn't come away empty handed. The match ended 2-2 and Somi came away with MOTM as a result (and deservedly so). 
Marlon Hairston - RM - 65 OVR
Another MLS wide player with a brace now in Marlon Hairston. This one came in Colorado Rapids' 3-1 home win over Houston Dynamo, from which teammate Tim Howard is also an option after making six saves. There are better goalkeeping options this week in my eyes though.
Robert Benson - CM - 57 OVR
Half of the Irish games were postponed on Friday, but three did get underway and from them, Benson looks to be the best option. The Irish midfielder found himself on the score-sheet twice during Dundalk's 3-0 win over Bray.
Nahir Besara - CF - 65 OVR
It was goals galore as Orebro hosted Norrkoping with the former coming out on top as 4-2 winners. Besara played in a deeper role just off the striker which coud be classified as either CF or CAM. Either way, his two goals and MOTM award should be enough for him.
Hiroyuki Abe - ST - 64 OVR
A second player from Kawasaki -- and it could easily have been three. Hiroyuki Abe is the one player who is certain to get in from their 5-0 win after scoring twice and assisting another two claiming a perfect 10/10 match rating."

The third FIFA Mobile Community Team of the week comes amidst some in-game drama. With a few contentious front runners now summarily dismissed from the game, a new No. 1 has risen from the aftermath:  Enter 'baozhu'.
Interestingly, our new champion seemed to catch wind of how the cTOTW is selected by the FIFA Mobile brass. Just hours before this most recent Season ended this past Wednesday, baozhu changed his team an in effort to get some of his favorites in and mix up what'd been a pretty static group of selections in the first two editions of the new program.
While it didn't work in whole, the spirit of his move was honored with some fresh blood and interesting players we haven't seen in any previous TOTWs, much less the Community editions. The master player this week, Liverpool target 96-overall Naby Keïta may not have the best boosts at his position -- particularly for those that seldom if ever leverage central defensive midfielders -- but these in-game stats are bonkers. If you see a CDM flying around the pitch, it's safe to assume it's this OP monster.
The cTOTW is in packs until next Wednesday around 8 p.m. ET (1 a.m. BST). You can expect packs and a live event all day Thursday and based on recent history, another early next week as well.
The plan is available for your perusal here as well as all the players comprising this week's FM cTOTW:
81 ST Zhang Yuning
84 CAM Takumi Minamino
82 LM Nathan Redmond
84 GK Christian Mathenia
84 CAM Vincent Koziello
87 RM Wilfried Zaha
86 RB Kyle Walker
88 CB Nicolas Otamendi
91 CB Vincent Kompany
81 RWB Xavier Chen

The 2016-17 campaign was a bit of a topsy-turvy affair for players and supporters of Manchester United alike. However, with the Europa League trophy to their names, the Red Devils can still boast that it was a successful one.
With a brand new season of FIFA Ultimate Team just under three months away, former FIFA community manager and YouTuber Chu ""ChuBoi"" Morah is back with yet another edition of his ratings predictions -- this time detailing and breaking down his own favorite club. Although he's a devoted United fan, I'll confess that Chu was quite fair and reasonable with his upgrades and downgrades. He may have even been a bit harsh on some of the downgrades.
Amongst the upgrades, the obvious candidate for the biggest increase is Spanish midfielder Ander Herrera, whose spectacular run of form and was instrumental in United's 25-match unbeaten run from October through April.
As always, If you haven't already seen them, be sure to check out Futhead's FIFA 18 player ratings prediction pages, including the new Icons (formerly known as Legends). You can make your voice heard by voting, plus take your thoughts to the comments and fight tooth and nail in an effort to make sure your favorite players get theirs.
Be sure to check out Chu's latest and let us know which United players he was on the mark about and which he should revist:

The FIFA 18 hype train has officially left the station as EA today revealed the very first details on what we can expect to see when the game releases on September 29th. Catch-up with everything we known about FIFA 18 so far HERE. 
So with a new front man, a new iconic legend and a community reunited, lets take a deeper look at FIFA18’s opening gambit. 
Legends become Icons
Whilst it was inevitable I guess that Xbox’s cast of footballing legends would eventually make their way onto PS4 and PC, I don’t think anyone really expected it to be this soon. The decision to partner with Microsoft exclusively has no doubt caused more harm than good over the long term as it not only divided the community, it also restricted EA’s own revenue stream on the largest console install base. The deal made little sense, but then exclusivity rarely does. 
It was also rumoured last year that EA were still locked into a multi-year deal with Microsoft over Legend exclusivity, so perhaps this year’s rebrand to ‘Icons’ was a way to finally “get out” of that agreement and offer these most rarest of FUT cards to all? Either that or EA’s deal with Microsoft simply lapsed, and they felt the time was right to refresh Legends, removing the baggage of the previous relationship entirely.
Either way, the move to unite FIFA 18’s Ultimate Team content across all platforms is undoubtedly a good one, but there maybe unforeseen knock-on effects too, as gamers and content creators no longer ‘need’ to play on Xbox to get the definitive FIFA experience for themselves and their viewers. Market prices in FIFA 18 could therefore be very interesting if a mass migration to Playstation takes place. 
R9
EA field hundreds of different requests to add ‘legends’ in to Ultimate Team each and every year but none more so than for the mercurial Brazilian Ronaldo R9. Pele has been the absolute pinnacle of Legend cards in previous versions, but that title is now surely under threat with the addition of the most requested, and likely most dangerous forward Ultimate Team will have ever seen. 
Away from the virtual game the acquisition of Ronaldo (R9) marks an incredible coup for EA who from a marketing perspective now hold so many killer cards they can play anytime in the run-up to release to send the FIFA 18 hype into the stratosphere. Just imagine those sweet, sweet Futhead Likes as well…
Cristiano
If the capture of R9 was a marketing masterstroke, then pairing him with the current Ballon d’Or holder is nothing short of genius. Ever since EA removed Messi from the cover of FIFA that genuine star quality he provided has been sorely missed. And whilst EA’s multi-coverstar approach and community voting strategy was admirable, it’s hasn’t really provided that ‘wow’ moment a coverstar really should. I mean when you open up voting to the internet, you get Jordan Henderson, and you should never go full Jordan Henderson.

The shift back to a singular megastar is clearly the way to go for FIFA and with Cristiano Ronaldo fresh from yet another Champions League triumph, the wind is certainly behind CR7’s very first appointment as leader of FIFA video games. Expect lots of social media, lots of behind the scenes videos, and likely one of the standout cover designs we will have seen in a number of years.

More individuality
The FIFA 18 teaser video is as expected a fairly frantic affair where the game's visuals are thrown at you in machine gun fire fashion. In the very small snippets our eyes are afforded, FIFA 18 looks predictably quite stunning with seemingly yet another graphics leap on the cards to build on FIFA 17’s already exemplary visuals. 
But the thing which stood out most for me in the teaser was just how well Ronaldo’s unique mannerisms were recreated. The shrugging of the shoulders, the free kick run-up and that all important celebration. Each of these iconic Ronaldo-isms were frighteningly real, down to the minutest of details, and hopefully that bodes well for individuality across the board in FIFA 18. EA have always struggled with player differentiation in the past so here’s hoping we’ll see some more of the individuality which makes football so engrossing to watch at EA Play. 
Early Access for all
Another thing the Xbox community have had over their PS4 brethren is EA Access, which as well as providing a catalogue of other EA games, also provides early access to FIFA a few days before the game launches. The lack of EA Access is down to Sony not EA, but it seems this year a solution has been found with FIFA 18 pre-orders (Ronaldo Edition and up) now offering the same early access perk. 
So whilst PS4 players may not get access to the free games, or the discount on purchases, they will at least be able to share in this smallest of pre-release rituals. Just like the unity Ultimate Team Icons will bring, this is yet another nice touch from EA to continue providing parity no matter which platform you choose to own. 
Summary
Considering how tame early FIFA teasers can be, what we actually got today was a solid set meaningful information, which is a fairly refreshing change for a company who once released a video to tease a screenshot not too long ago. What a time to be alive that was. 
The pairing of the Ronaldo’s is absolutely huge in terms of marketing the game, and as such FIFA 18 has got off to a really strong start by bringing in two players that appeal to both the heart, and the mind. EA never go early with legend reveals, but I think that shows just how big R9 is in the grand scheme of things, and his addition represents a huge statement of intent from EA on everything they plan to do with FIFA 18 this year. 
The only thing we currently lack are concrete details on changes to gameplay and modes which we of course hope will follow at EA Play in the coming days. And if EA can maintain the momentum FIFA 18’s early reveal has created, it could be a whirlwind summer for us all."

The newest batch of FUT 18 player ratings have been released by EA SPORTS FIFA's production team. So far, EA has revealed the Top 100-81 players along with a few high rated stars. Now we've been given the Top 80-61, which includes two five-star skillers. 
Notable rating boosts include Tottenham Hotspur's Jan Vertoghen and Real Madrid's Casemiro, who both jumped from an 83 to an 85. In addition, Chelsea's Cesar Azpilicueta earned a +1 overall boost and a real-life necessitated position change from LB to CB.
Not every player was so lucky. FIFA 17 cover star Marco Reus received a harsh -2 drop while aging stars Petr Cech and Pepe saw their ratings decrease as well.
The first officially confirmed five-star skillers to be named in FUT 18 include Bayern Munich's Franck Ribery and Paris Saint-Germain's Angel Di Maria.
Make sure to keep a close eye on Futhead over the next few weeks as we post the latest FIFA 18 ratings as they are released."

This is the second of the MLS All-Star items that I will be reviewing over the next few days. In order to review as many of the items as possible, the reviews will be slightly shorter than usual.
In this review, we'll be looking at the TOTS David Villa. 

In-game stats and rating
In my opinion, David Villa has some of the best stats in the game. At first glance, they may not seem ridiculous, but upon further inspection, I was blown away. 

He has 99 finishing, 99 positioning, 92 shot power, 88 long shots, 97 free kicks, 99 curve, 95 ball-control, 92 dribbling, 95 heading, 88 stamina, 79 strength, and 80 aggression. Oh, and he has four-star skills with a five-star weak foot, as well as 83 composure.
I used a Hawk chemistry style on him, to boost his pace, shooting and physical.

With that boost, he becomes a 95-rated ST. You know he's going to be good.

Squad
I used Villa in this squad: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7559972/

I used him at ST in the 4231 formation. I make two small changes in-game - I swap Dos Santos with Giovinco, and then swap Giovinco with Villa (so that Villa ends up at the ST position).
I used the squad above for 10 games, so I'll be basing my reviews on those 10 games. All games were played in Div. 1.
Stats
Here are my stats with TOTS Villa:
Games: 10
Goals: 16
Assists: 4
Chemistry Style: Hawk
Let's get into the review.
Review
Pace: 10/10
He felt a lot faster than the stats show. With the Hawk chemistry style, he's supposed to have 91 pace, but he feels closer to 95. I love that we can use a fast David Villa item once again -- his items in recent years have always been lacking on the pace side, but this item is perfect in that respect.
Shooting: 11/10
Perfection. From range, he is lethal. From the edge of the box, he is lethal. Inside the box, he is lethal. He's the complete forward in this game -- from anywhere, with any kind of shot, against any keeper, he's going to be able to score. Throw in the five-star weakfoot, and you have one of the best shooters in the game. His shot power, finishing, volleys, long shots, positioning - everything is sublime.
Passing: 9/10
He wasn't perfect in this respect, but the vast majority of passes were on target. His short passes are always on target, and his long-passing is suprisingly accurate. He did misplace some of the harder passes, and his crossing was largely untested in the 10 games. His free-kicks are also solid -- I scored two 40-yard bangers with him.
Dribbling: 10/10
Touch-tight ball-control, a perfect first touch, all combined with great agility, balance and reactions. He feels very nimble in game, and he can easily dribble past opponents. I had absolutely no issues with his dribbling
Defending: N/A
He's quite strong, with good stamina, so he can win the ball back, but it's nothing spectacular.
Physical: 8/10
Perhaps the only weakness this item has is his strength (see what I did there?) -- he's not too strong in game. He's powerful enough to hold his own against the weaker defenders and midfielders, but he will get bull-dozed by the stronger ones. I found him to be particularly effective against the Kyle Walkers and Hector Bellerins of the world -- Villa's aggression is decent enough to make him feel a lot stronger in game, and it boosts his strength to a position where he can compete with full-backs. The Hawk chemistry style definitely helps in this department. 
Oh, and his stamina is great. So he can terrorize your opponents all game long.
Weakfoot: 10/10
I cannot stress how important a five-star weakfoot is. It means that he's equally deadly on either foot, and completely uncontainable. You give him a yard of space on either side, and he'll make you pay.
Skill moves: 9/10
I guess he could have the five-star skill moves, but given how good his item is already, they aren't needed.
Summary
I loved this item. He's one of the best forwards you can get his year, and has some ridiculously good stats. He's a world-class goal scorer, and very good on the ball, and his strength issues have largely been fixed. I really recommend getting this item -- you won't get too many better strikers for 120-200K.
Rating: 9.5/10
Value for coins: 9/10"

If you're not super familiar with the German third division, you're not alone. I'm a Bayern Munich supporter and even I could probably only rattle off two or three clubs if pressed. But perhaps surprisingly, it's one of the more popular ancillary pro leagues out there. And with England's Top 4 flights already represented in FIFA, it was only a matter of time before Germany got in the act too.
According to a report in Kicker, Germany's '3. Liga' will be in FIFA 18. An official announcement from the DfB and EA are all that remains. If you're looking for a deeper German career mode, say with the likes of SpVgg Unterhaching or Karlsruher SC this coming Autumn, you're in luck. It remains to be seen if FUT items will be incorporated as part of the arrangement, but based on 2. Bundesliga and perhaps more appropriately, England's EFL League One, you shouldn't expect much impact outside of Silver and Bronze packs.
This may also come as welcome news for fans of American football. A number of rising stars and lesser known Yanks hone their craft in the 3. Liga including the former USMNT senior capped Joe Gyau.
The Chinese Super League it's not, but new leagues and clubs are seemingly always welcome in FIFA. Which other unrepresented leagues would you like to see in the next game (or beyond)?"

The transfer of the summer may be here.
While there's bound to be smoke around any number of La Liga stars Manchester United may flirt with (and potentially ultimately sign, after Atleti's transfer ban curbed any Antoine Griezmann relocation plans), Arsenal of all clubs have jumped to the forefront of the football world by landing recent FUTs legend Alexandre Lacazette. Interestingly, a Spanish high governing body's ruling on Atletico Madrid's transfer status may have been the domino necessary to put Arsenal's record signing in motion.
When City and Spurs sniffed around Lacazette a season or two prior, his eye-popping finishing numbers probably overblew where he was at as a striker. More polished and ready for the main stage now, Lacazette may not cure all that ails the Gunners, but he will surely give them a big name with potential big results on the pitch to match.
It's easy to wonder just how 1:1 Lacazette's game will translate from France to arguably the most competitive football league in the world. But let's be honest -- you're more interested in what this means for FIFA 18 (and beyond):
Strong links ahoy
Surely we all love watching great players play for great teams in a great league. But given the FUT chemistry system, having stars of the same country of origin/international representation are a big coup, too.
Just a few of the names Laca will instantly have strong chemistry with include (but aren't limited to):


Paul Pogba


N'Golo Kanté


Anthony Martial


Loïc Rémy


It's anyone's guess whether new teammate (for the time being) Olivier Giroud will stick around in North London -- he may well elect to move to alternative pastures in an effort to secure his spot in Russia next summer -- but if he does, that'd make for quite the perfect link, especially for those of a red-and-white persuasion.
Finally, more pace in the middle up top
The Premier League is loaded with a number of the best and brightest strikers football have to offer. Harry Kane's monstrous goal-scoring output probably in some small way influenced Arsene Wenger's big splash in its own right. Romelu Lukaku may well don a different shade of blue this coming season, but unless you could afford his Team of the Season item, there was a chance he didn't quite have the giddyup that suits your play style.
WIth Sergio Agüero and wantaway Alexis Sánchez the only real alternatives, PL and PL hybrid enthusiasts will now be able to leverage the man colloquially known as Laca-sweat.
Lacazette's base item in FUT 17 showcased 84 acceleration and 87 sprint speed. A PL bump in those would hardly be unexpected.
With his overall rating likely to hover around 86 or 87, he'll be pricy -- Arsenal and all -- but perhaps not impossibly unaffordable.
A little early-season FUT pack luck and who knows, you might just have the pacey center attacker your Premier League squad's been lacking.
Ones To Watch hype
We don't know for sure what the future of the Ones to Watch items will hold. 2017's inaugural go seemed positive enough, but that the cards didn't receive TOTS/TOTY upgrades left some wanting more and with FIFA Mobile sporting more specific-match-upgrade driver Impact player items, it's possible we could see some evolution in FIFA 18.
But say OTWs return essentially in the same form they were in this past season: Lacazette's instantly jumps to the top of your want list.
Rest assured it'll be quite pricy; with Lacazette likely Arsenal's main goal-scoring threat and potentially on the receiving end of many a perfectly threaded Mesut Özil through balls, given his recent Team of the Week track record, it's safe to assume some black-and-gold Premier League upgraded items will be in his not-too-distant future.
But if you're a Gunner or a Frenchman or you could just scoring sweaty goals left and right, many this evening got a new addition to the top of their FUT 18 want list.

So what about you? What are you most interested about regarding Lacazette's move to the Prem? What kind of impact will he have on the next iteration of the Weekend League?"

Manchester FUT Champions Cup winner Aldossary 'Rogue Msdossary' Mosaad finished his first day in the Xbox One Playoffs with a commanding 5-0 record, only furthering his status as one of the current-best FIFA players in the world. He was only one of two competitors in the Xbox division, out of 64, to finish undefeated after the first day's proceedings.
The event, held in Amsterdam, is the third in the EA SPORTS FIFA 18 Global Series and the first of two playoff legs to come this week. Starting Friday, a total of 64 new competitors -- from the PlayStation division -- will go against each other in a three-day competition for the chance to qualify for FIFA eWorld Cup Grand Final in early August. Only 16 will go through, eight from each console.
Amsterdam's format is similar to Barcelona and Manchester; every match between two players, including the Knockout Stage matches and the Grand Final, is played over two legs. The player with the higher aggregate score is declared the winner, but, if the scoreline remains tied after two games, extra-time and penalties decide the winner. The Group Stage follows the same Swiss format they have had in every competition thus far this year. Seven rounds are played, four wins ensures qualification to the Knockouts, and four losses means elimination from the competition.
On Monday, five of the seven Group Stage rounds were played. Of the Xbox players, 24 have learned their fate -- 12 have gone through, and 12 have been eliminated. But, 40 still remain in the hunt for a place in the Knockout Rounds with 3-2 or 2-3 records. As mentioned earlier, two remain undefeated, and they'll play each other next in Round 6. Msdossary is the first, and he'll have some hearty competition: 2017 FIFA Interactive World Cup Champion Spencer ‘FaZe Gorilla’ Ealing.
Apart from the two 5-0 recordholders, Niklas 'Nraseck 7' Raseck, a German player who Msdossary considered his toughest opponent in Manchester, finished 4-1. His only loss came against Hashtag United's Ryan Pessoa, 7-3. Kurt 'Kurt0411' Fenech, another staple in these competitions who most recently was at the center of some controversy for his behavior at the FIFA eClub World Cup, finished 4-1 as well. 
All three of Hashtag United's Xbox One players are still alive in the competition; Hashtag dreamR qualified with a 4-1 record Monday, while Ryan sports a 3-2 record and Hashtag Harry is at 2-3. Both will need a strong showing in Rounds 6 and 7 to clinch a spot in the Knockout Rounds. Donovan 'F2TeKkz' Hunt, the Barcelona FUT Champions Cup winner, ended Monday with a 3-2 record. Hunt had the chance to qualify in the fifth round against AFC Ajax's Joey, but the marathon affair finished 5-4 to the latter after penalties. 
Of those eliminated from the competition today, Paris Saint-Germain's Lucas 'PSG DaXe' Cuillerier, a player who has been in the competitive FIFA circuit since early last year, was the biggest name to drop. He finished with a disappointing 0-4 record. 
The broadcast crew will be back Tuesday morning at 6 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UK time) for the final two rounds of the group stages. The knockout rounds will follow.

Let's get it right out of the way: building a FIFA Mobile Vs Attack Master Player is a bit about the journey, not the destination. Of course, the destination's not so bad in and of itself.
Whether you're looking to build 100-overall Jan Oblak, Kaka, or today's focus, David Luiz, you're getting one of the five best boost possessing players (+1 OVR to all stats plus +2 TAC to all players as if the former wasn't enough) in the game. There's a reason you put all the time grinding and/or investing FIFA Points to make this a reality.
But what about how the players actually stack up in game? It's a simple question to posit, but harder to actually execute on a meaningful conclusion: Is 100-overall David Luiz worth it?
Reviewing a centerback is a challenge. JoeBilineHD -- who participated in this review -- has an outstanding look at 100-overall Kaka you can peruse.
I set about trying to objectively evaluate Luiz as simply as could be done: have a couple league mates (Joe included) take four turns against a defense including 100-overall Luiz, two in a four-back setup, two in a three-back, with Luiz in the primary (left) centerback capacity to maximize his involvement. I went about to put in a similar number of turns myself, two of each type with and without Luiz in my lineup (replaced by the 97-overall Team of the Year Gerard Pique when he was out) to see how I fared.
The results were a bit all over the place.

This is the first of the MLS All-Star items that I will be reviewing over the next few days. In order to review as many of the items as possible, the reviews will be slightly shorter than usual.
We begin with a somewhat unusual choice: TOTS Michael Bradley."

On the heels of FC Barcelona officially releasing Neymar after accepting a world-record €222 million fee that activated the Brazilian winger’s buyout clause from the club, Neymar’s record breaking move to Paris is official. 
Whether or not you’re a Barcelona or PSG fan, Neymar’s move to Ligue 1 shakes up the FUT landscape a little bit. 
Where does Neymar fit in your FUT squad?
Going to Ligue 1, Neymar leaps ahead off all other LW/LF options for your Ligue 1 squad. Players like AS Monaco’s Thomas Lemar and OL Lyon’s Memphis Depay are the only other elite options at the position in the league, leaving Neymar to be the most desired option. PSG now has a plethora of Brazilian players on their roster for this season, which will give players a lot of perfect chemistry links to utilize when building hybrid squads.
With Neymar no longer in a primary league, linking him into your squad may have just gotten a bit tougher in FIFA 18, so utilizing the PSG Brazilian links in the back will be one key way of fitting him into your squad. Without too many elite ST options in Ligue 1 outside of Edenson Cavani and Kylian Mbappe, we’ll likely see many more Neymar to Gabriel Jesus and Roberto Firmino links from LW-ST in the next installment of the FIFA franchise, opening the door to some interesting Ligue 1-Premier League hybrids. Outside of linking Neymar to his fellow countrymen, creativity will certainly be key to incorporating him into your FIFA 18 FUT squads.
Price drop?
The good news for Neymar fans is that his price should drop in FIFA 18. Not being in LaLiga or on Barcelona should have a significant impact on Neymar in the marketplace, especially for his gold card and possibly even for his in-forms. His gold card stayed north of 200k coins for most of FIFA 17, but we could see his card value drop once the market stabilizes in FIFA 18. 
One version of Neymar that could be astronomically expensive is his Ones To Watch card. We saw plenty of elite players move in last summer's transfer window and get OTW cards in FIFA 17, but nobody the calibur of player that Neymar is. His OTW card could see an insane boost in stats throughout the season and be one of the most valuable cards in all of FIFA.
What does this mean for Neymar's TOTY chances?
As we get closer to the release of FIFA 18 in September, we’re also inching our way toward nominations and voting for TOTY. Could Neymar’s chances at a TOTY card be hurt now that he’s not in a primary league? It’s possible.
But it’s also possible that he could flourish and stand out at PSG, away from Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez and in his own limelight. His move to Ligue 1 is certainly worth keeping an eye on when TOTY voting takes place later this year."

In the first full month of the 'Community Team of the Week' being out in FIFA Mobile, we have seen a wide variety of players get cards - from a Striker Theo Walcott, to the throwback of Eric Bailly and Aurélien Chedjou, to an insane LWB Emil Forsberg - but it is Manchester City's new French wing-back Benjamin Mendy who gets the award of POTM.
An interesting position change from LB to LWB sees him become the highest rated LWB by two ratings - compared to the one he would be top by at LB - and with his boosts of +3 Tackling and +2 Sprint Speed to all, he is by no means a slouch. With just the four cPOTW tokens needed to complete the plan, it looks far more achieveable than the previous POTM of Modric, which needed 100 Elite Trophies alongside two cPOTW tokens. 
Does Mendy offer any improvements to your team? If you have him, how are you finding him? Let us know in the comments below."

Fans of EA SPORTS's FIFA Mobile are well versed with the /r/futmobile subreddit. While the sub's a bit known for its constructive criticism, the positives it adds to the community makes it an underrated and essential part of the game's extended network.
Back when EA solicited Twitter to put together a short list of players to include in its ultimately fantastic recent ""Summer Celebration"" Program, Nicklas ""Lord B"" Bendtner predictably became a rallying point for social media and Reddit alike. One community staple, 'famian09' even made a pledge regarding the cult favorite:
Comment from discussion Help EA pick the players They feature in Their next Seasonal Program.

Another user went a step further, asking him to put his money where his mouth was and design what the make-or-break item would look like. So he went as far as to do so:

While Lord B unfortunately came up just short, falling instead to Besiktas' Ricardo Quaresma in the fan vote, the FIFA Mobile team, no strangers to Reddit, went a step further to shoutout 'famian09'-- by actualy putting his designed Nicklas Bendtner  item exclusively in game just for him.
The incredible looking 100-overall Bendtner joins FIFA Mobile team leader Todd Batty's 99-overall Daniel Batty in the pantheon of rarefied personalized FIFA Mobile items.
Pretty cool if we do say so ourselves."

Last week's score: 19/23
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad Link: http://www.futhead.com/18/squads/563071/


Goalkeeper
Alexandr Belenov - GK - OVR 76
The keeper selection was not as straight forward as it has been recently, but for me, I believe there are two real options here. Belenov, who made a total of four saves, one of which was a last-minute penalty in a 0-0 draw with CSKA, is our front runner. Alternatively, we have Rui Patricio who made seven saves in a 0-0 with Porto. I have gone with the Russian, due to the penalty, but it really could go either way.
Defenders
Ben Davies - LWB - OVR 78
It doesn't seem to matter who Spurs put in the wingback position as they always perform. Both Tripper, who claimed two assists, and Davies, with a goal and assist, stand a chance of making the side. But for me, the Welshman is the best option from the 4-0 win.
Maicon - CB - OVR 80
Although Galatasaray conceded twice, which will not help Maicon's cause, the fact that it means his brace was crucial in the final result will. A last-minute goal from the Brazilian saw the home side come away with a 3-2 win, keeping them five points clear at the top.
Nacho Monreal - CB - OVR 80
Monreal is naturally a LB but has been deployed in a back three as of late which has gone down with mixed reviews. He played a big part in their 2-0 win this week though, scoring one of the two alongside helping to keep a clean sheet for them.
Midfielders
Neymar - LM - OVR 92
PSG are almost certain to pick up at least one IF, if not two, but who that will be is up for debate. Neymar is the obvious choice, scoring twice, assisting another and receiving an 8/10 from L'Equipe. But with both Draxler and Meunier also picking up 8/10s, both are also in high contention.
Marouane Fellaini - CM - OVR 79
Who needs Paul Pogba? United continue their dominance with a 4-0 win over Palace, of whom still are yet to pick up a point, or even score this season. The big Belgian scored two of the four goals making him a prime candidate for the side.
Marcelo Brozovic - CAM - OVR 81
Calcio A already has a few decent cheap in-forms and is set for another with Brozovic. The Croatian scored both of Inter's goals in a narrow 2-1 win which saw him pick up an impressive 8/10 from Gazzetta.
Isco - CAM - OVR 86
The Spanish leagues offered very little in terms of options, hence having just the one selected from them. This significantly helps Isco's cause with multiple other midfield braces occurring. A big name alongside one of only a couple of Liga BBVA options almost makes him a certainty.
Lucas Ocampos - LW - OVR 76
OM pulled off an impressive 4-2 win over Nice from which multiple players performed well in. Ocampos was the pick of the bunch though, scoring twice and claiming an 8/10 from L'Equipe for doing so.
Forwards
Luis Alberto - ST - OVR 77
There are several players which could pick up an IF from Lazio, but as is often the case, I have opted for the official MOTM. The Spaniard Luis ALberto scored two of his own alongside assisting another to claim an 8/10. Parolo is the next best option, but with a 7.5 is over-shadowed.
Cedric Bakambu - ST - OVR 81
Now a SIF in just the third week of FIFA is a push, but with no other big-name strikers managing that, it does put him in good stance. The Villarreal man scored all three of their goals, leading them to a 3-0 home win over Eibar.
Substitutes
Robin Himmelmann - GK - OVR 70
The first player in what is a bench which pretty much picks itself is Himmelmann. The German is the first of two from the second division which can help compensate for the lack of first division selections. He picks up his spot after making a total of 9 saves, one of which was a penalty in a 2-0 win, claiming the top mark from Kicker in the process.
Justin Morrow - LWB - OVR 71
The hat tricks start off nice and early this week, with Morrow scoring three from defense, which is the first defender hat trick in 20 years in MLS. Toronto went on to win 4-2, and although he conceded twice, let's be honest: Morrow will be getting an IF. TFC clinching the Supporters' Shield (best regular season record) doesn't hurt his case either.
Christoph Knasmullner - CM - OVR 66
The Austrian league looks set to pick up their first IF of the year after once again we saw a hat trick from midfield, which seems to be becoming a regular occurrence. Knasmullner was the player who managed it, coming in a 4-2 home win for Admira.
Tarique Fosu - CM - OVR 63
Yet another hat trick from midfield now and Fosu has potential to be a very good silver IF with the current upgrades. He scored all three of Charlton's goals in a 3-1 away win, putting them in a playoff spot.
Adam Rooney - ST - OVR 69
There were a few SPL options this week but none were better than that of Rooney, after the Irish striker scored three for Aberdeen in a 3-0 home win.
Sebastian Andersson - ST - OVR 68
If for some reason you wanted a strong link between two Swedish Bundes 2 discard IFs, now is your chance to do so after Andersson scored all three Kaiserslautern   in a 3-0 win. Andersson and Ishak up top?!
Youssouf Hadji - ST - OVR 70
When you consider that Ligue 2 had barely any IFs over the whole of FIFA 17, you would be surprised to see that they are in line for another in just the third week of 18. Hadji scored three of four Nancy goals as they cruised to a 4-1 home win. The best part is that if  Mothib was in the game it is likely they would have picked up two.
Reserves
Hakan  Arslan - CM - OVR 78
Two IFs from the Turkish league is somewhat of rarity in EA's TOTW process, but with two top end performances, it surely has to occur on Wednesday. We have already mentioned Maicon, but Arslan put in the more impressive shift. The Turk scored three times from central midfield, helping Sivasspor to a 3-1 home win.
Lucas Castro - CM - OVR 78
We now find ourselves back over in Italy after several top performances occurred this week. Chievo pulled off a shock 2-1 home win over Fiorentina of which their Argentine midfielder, Castro, scored both. Although he only picked up a 7.5 match rating, which is lower than several others in the league, the result should help him.
Steven Berghuis - RW - OVR 76
Berghuis really has stood out for Feyenoord in recent months and with another two goals, plus an assist to his name this week it could finally be time to see him pick up an IF. The Dutchman also picked up player of the week for good measure.
Jose Sand - ST - OVR 78
Although Sand does have two penalties to his name, with the sheer lack of gold ST options, he makes my side. After all, there have been several players get in for this exact reasoning recently.
Nicolas Stefanelli - ST - OVR 66
With the new system in place, I believe we will see more silver to gold in both the sub and reserve spots, which in a sense is fairer as with multiple hat tricks in the past some have missed out. Stefanelli falls into that category after scoring three of AIK's five goals on Sunday."

An accidental early deploy or an attempt to influence voting?
After a FUTTIES Winner Musa was briefly available in FIFA 17 the day before voting ended, with the vote now a wrap, your winner is -- Ahmed Musa.
The Sweat God's upgraded item looks pretty sweet, but at this point in FUT, with 18 so close we can just about taste it, it's hard to muster a ton of excitement. If you're calling it a FIFA with nothing but FUTTIES Winners in your squad, hey, maybe though.
The latest unveiled vote also looks interesting on paper -- but will it skew towards the Premier League as just about every FUTTIES ballot to this point has? Manchester City's Gabriel Jesus is joined by Real Madrid/Spain rising star Marco Asensio and OTW-injury-curse-debutant Breel Donald Embolo. The one time career-mode star has to be a sentimental favorite, but Jesus' PL clout just might be too much.
The polls are open until early next week. Godspeed to those chasing a particular player."

Struggling to win the free Daily Knockout Tournament Team of the Season items? Your boy's got you.
FIFA esports host, streamer, YouTuber extraordinaire and former EA FIFA community manager Chu ""Chu Boi"" Morah joins FUT Weekly Podcast's Ben as well as Futhead's very own Luke ""lukezim"" Zimmermann to get you squared away. Chu, Ben, and Luke all share their strategies, plus some cheeky cup final intimidation tactics bordering on shameful from Luke -- you won't want to miss those.
Our podcasting trio also talk about Team of the Season so far: what's good (""the best Premier League Team of the Season ever""?), what leaves something to be desired, as well as whether or not some of the early ""controversies"" have really been as bad as they seemed at the time. Chu also gives insights as to what his FUT 14 World Cup launch experience was like, some of the lessons learned, and he and Luke speculate on what we might see in this year's much anticipated game update/mode. The May 29 release could very well be one of if not the events of the year.

Today, we'll be taking a look at a couple of the MLS TOTS items that I wanted to review, but didn't have time to fully.
I didn't have a particular squad where I used these players; instead, I used them in various squads, in various positions, and sometimes even as subs. These reviews are far less thorough than the reviews I usually do, but I wanted to get some of this information out to the FIFA community.
Nemanja Nikolic
We start with TOTS Nikolic.

I had originally picked up Nikolic's 84-rated in-form item as an investment, but ended up using him for a couple of games as a stop-gap striker, and he was very decent. So when the TOTS item dropped, I had to give him a go.
If you are looking for a clinical finisher, who is very good on the ball, this is your man. He's deadly inside the box, and absolutely clinical. His long range shooting isn't half bad either. On the ball, he's very agile, has good balance, and perfect ball control and dribbling. To top it off, he's quite fast, and very strong, so he's the definition of a beast. The four-star weak foot feels like a five-star, making him deadly on both feet. In the air, he's surprisingly competent, and feels taller than he actually is in game.
He does have a couple of issues. The two-star skills is a big one for me, as is his height - he still gets dominated by taller CBs. He's also not the quickest, and at times, he does drift out of position. I also didn't find his passing to be too consistent. However, as a target man, or the main goal scorer of your team, he'll do the job. He's a goal machine, and can do it against pretty much any opponent. For his price, you should try him out.
Rating: 9/10
Value for coins: 9/10
Miguel Almiron
Next, we are taking a look at TOTS Almiron.

I used him primarily as a super-sub, and wow; this guy is incredible. He's very, very fast, a great dribbler, and a surprisingly decent shooter and passer. At the end of games, he can come on and cause all sorts of issues for your opponents. However, I did find him to be very weak, and he was bullied all the time. He's also only got the three-star/three-star combination, which might be good for a lot of you, but doesn't cut it for me.
However, I must stress how effective he was as a late game sub. He simply came on, and tore the defenses apart -- he scored, he assisted, but he also poked holes in the defense for others to exploit.
Rating: 8.5/10
Value for coins: 8.5/10
Bastian Schweinsteiger
Now, let's take a quick look at TOTS Schweini.

If you can overlook his pace, he's a very good item. However, he's very, very slow. I used a Shadow chemistry item on him, and he was still too slow for me. His stamina just wasn't good enough for me, and he felt very clunky in game. But his technical stats were nothing short of brilliant. He had a great shot on him, both from range and inside the box. His passing was superb, so he can easily be the pass-master of your team. His ball control and dribbling were ok, but nothing special. I did like his defending and physical stats -- he was very good in the tackle, and at reading the play, and he constantly dominated and bullied his opponents. A very good destroyer in the middle of the park. I'd  recommend subbing him off after the 60th minute, but for the first 60 minutes, he can do the job.
Rating: 7/10
Value for coins: 8/10
Kaka
Finally, a quick word on TOTS Kaka.

I used him for a handful of games, and, well, I'm not going to sugar coat it: I absolutely hated the item. He felt slow, clunky, and his stamina was awful. His shooting didn't live up to his stats, his passing was inconsistent, and his dribbling was plain awful. That's why I didn't fully review this one -- I just couldn't bring myself to play any more games with him. I absolutely do not recommend this player item. He didn't play anywhere close to his rating, and is absolutely not a competitive item.
Rating: 5/10
Value for coins: 5/10

I hope this was reasonably useful in helping you decide what FIFA 17 MLS TOTS players to pick up, and which ones to avoid."

As we move into our third set of Community Team of the Week's which lead on to the Player of the Month, we come across another big month, which will need 5 Player of the Week tokens in order to claim the POTM at the end. This may make the plan more expensive for some, but the reward will be just as good on the other side, so make sure you plan ahead if you are thinking of going for the August Player of the Month!
This weeks winner is a currently league-less 'lesliekan', who held off close competition from two members of the 'Royals' league to win the honour of having a TOTW made in their name. Unlike many of the previous winners, lesliekan didn't make too many major changes to their team, meaning we have a lot of big name players who have higher rated cards already released. This will hopefully mean that the price of the plan is lower than what others have been in recent weeks.
We start off with a solid week, with some very nice cards which can be traded in for an even better master. With Calcio A teams being a popular choice for many - no doubt in part due to a certian Mr Mertens - the master 96 rated Giorgio Chiellini comes as a welcome upgrade to his 93 rated Champions League and 94 rated Team of the Season iterations, and with boosts of +1 Tackling and +1 Strength, he is by no means a poor replacement for either of them.
The full team this week is:
85 GK Asmir Begović
85 CB Laurent Ciman
86 CB Casemiro
90 CDM David Luiz
86 LM Marcelo
88 RM Dani Alves
90 CAM Philippe Coutinho
91 LW Eden Hazard
92 CF Robert Lewandowski
84 RW Kamil Grosicki
96 Giorgio Chiellini (Master Player)"

Mr. Summer Team of the Week himself is finally here.
Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors striker Lee Dong Gook, a staple of the K-League and Korean national teams alike, has a distinguished EA SPORTS FIFA summer/big-domestic-leagues-offseason Team of the Week history:
FIFA 12: TOTW 41

If you're a hardcore collector, maybe a weaker on paper TOTW is just your bag. If you've been chomping at the bit to do a Lee Dong Gook to Glory, this is perhaps the most exciting week of your year.
The rest of us will have to make do. The first TOTW of FIFA 18 is another week closer.

It’s getting closer to that time of the year where EA starts to tease player ratings. 
As we wait for the debates to begin, former EA Sports FIFA community manager and current Twitch/Youtube star Chu ‘ChuBoi’ Morah has passed the time by releasing player prediction videos. 
In recent weeks, he has projected the ratings for Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona. But now, he will tackle the Premier League’s biggest upgrades. 
The 2016/17 Premier League season saw a return to sanity after the previous spell concluded with Leicester City oddly dawning the crown. Everything went back to normal as Chelsea FC lifted the cup and Manchester United returned to the Champions League football. The 2016/17 campaign saw its fair share of rising stars. From Chelsea’s Macos Alonso to Tottenham’s Heung Min Son, there was a plethora of breakout stars. 
In his latest video, Chu makes the case that both Alonso and Son will boast a +4 upgrade – which is hard to argue against. Both London area stars were terrific for their sides and helped guide their sides to Champions League football this season.
But who else deserves an upgrade? Check out ChuBoi’s video to find out.

Bayern Munich is a classy organization. Accordingly, one recent star and a fellow legend (and club lifer to boot) get the class blue-and-pink untradeable Squad Buildling Challenge items they deserve as they call it a career.
With over 1300 matches, 12 league crowns, 10 domestic cups, three Champions League titles, a pair of World Cups and two European championship to their names, Xabi Alonso and Philipp Lahm get their last non-Icon FIFA Ultimate Team items in the form of these two beauties.
The Bayern and Liverpool/Real Madrid greats get to ride off into the sunset with two of the better Bundesliga items you'll be able to obtain this FIFA. Lahm's card is finally befitting of a BuLi RB while Alonso's pace spikes from virtually unplayable to even vastly superior to TOTS Toni Kroos levels.
Whether you're a die hard Bavarians backer or merely a FUT collector, you've got until FIFA 18 launch to complete these SBCs."

The FIFA 18 Team of the Week hype train keeps rolling.
With Ones to Watch items now squarely in the mix, the question remained: which standout performers would we see get performance boost to their dynamic player items?
Paris Saint Germain's Neymar was clearly the leader in the clubhouse, with many expecting his contributions to another dominant PSG victory being enough to get his first in-form of this FIFA. But another school of thought says that if Neymar were to get IFs every time he got 2 goals and 1 assist in Ligue 1 play, he'd be at 99 overall in no time.
The latter wins the day this time, with instead Borussia Dortmund's Andriy Yarmolenko getting the honors as the first post-Alvaro Morata OTW to be christened with a bit of a bump. If you invested in the Ukranian, you're undoubtedly happy with your returns at the moment.
Joining the BVB standout is English super striker Harry Kane and for his role in helping take down defending champions Chelsea, Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne gets his first in-form of FUT 18. 
To be honest, this week's bench may lack a litlte bit of the star quality of the previous two TOTWs, but there are a few hidden gems including long time Danish La Liga bargain beast Daniel Wass getting a special item.

Today, we'll be taking a look at the recently released POTM Sadio Mané.

As a Liverpool fan, I love watching this man play in real life. He's mesmerizing, he's magical and most importantly, he's absolutely lethal. Mané has three major aspects to his game - his pace, his power, and his dribbling. This card captures those three aspects perfectly.
In-Game Stats

Mané's in-game stats are ludicrous. Without any boosts, he has 96 acceleration and 93 sprint speed, making him one of the fastest cards in the game. He has 89 positioning, 88 finishing, 81 shot power, making him deadly up front. His dribbling stats are top-notch, with 93 agility, 89 balance, 87 ball control and 90 dribbling, and his powerful play-style is perfectly captured in his 88 stamina, 77 strength and 78 aggression.
I used him with the Marksman chemistry style, on 7 chemistry as a striker. Even on 7 chemistry, the boosts are remarkable - his positioning and shot power go up by 6, his finishing by 3, all of his dribbling stats (except for balance) by 3, and he receives 80 strength with 81 aggression.

He also comes with the ""Speed Dribbler"" and ""Tries to Beat Defensive Line"" traits, making this card even better.
Squad
I'm currently using Mané in this squad:

I love the 4321 this year, and I love all the players in this side. I'm currently saving up to buy that Sergio Ramos card, which would really complete this team.
Stats
I've now used Mané for 18 games, and here are my stats with him:
Price: His SBC cost me ~240K total
Games: 18
Goals: 30
Assists: 4
Let's get into the review.
Review
Pace: 10/10
He's fast. He's really, really fast. He's so fast it will blow your mind. He's fast enough to get past most players on this game, and fast enough to give even the really fast ones a run for their money. He's that fast. He's so fast you want to use sprint sparingly. He's very, very fast.
Also, did I mention that he's ridiculously fast?
Dribbling: 10/10
Perfect. When I first started using him, I thought he gave the ball away a lot when I was trying to turn or do skill moves. The simple remedy for that is to, the second before you turn or skill, release the sprint button, make your move, and then accelerate. You master that, you master Mane, and you master FUT 18. I love this card on the ball -- dribbling is silky smooth, agility and balance are incredible, and the reactions are high enough.
Shooting: 9/10
The only downside here is that he can be a little inconsistent in front of goal, but once again, that's only if he's at top, top speed. Slow down for a nanosecond before pulling the trigger, and the ball will be tearing through the back of the net (actually, thanks to the awful net animations, it will probably just hit the net and fall straight to the ground). His finishing inside the box is great, and he can do it on either foot. Low-driven shots, finesse shots, straight up power shots -- all of them are deadly. I especially like his finesse shots from the edge of the box. Didn't get to score a long shot with him, but given the state of long shots in this game, I'm sure he's fine in that regard.
Passing: 9/10
Gets the job done. Run down the wing, cut inside, drill a pass into the penalty area, and watch as chaos ensues. Or, skirt past the opponent, whip a cross in, and watch Martial score or hit the crossbar. He's very, ver effective as a winger this year, and I have no complaints. He's no Xavi, but hey, no one is asking him to be.
Defending: N/A
He's a LW on 7 chemistry playing at ST. Give him a break.
That being said, pace + strength + aggression + stamina = handful for any defender trying to keep the ball away from him.
Physical: 9/10
Very, very strong in game, especially if you shield properly. He can hold off opponents long enough to use his pace to get past them, or push a defender for just long enough to get a shot or pass away. I especially like his stamina, because it means that he can run all game long. Even in the 90th minute, he'll be an absolute workhorse, and one of the fastest players on the pitch.
Is he worth it?
This is a new section that I will start including for the SBC cards I review. I want to try to give you an idea of whether the card is worth it, before you sink hundreds of thousands of coins into an untradeable player.
In Mané's case, he really is. For 240K, you are getting an elite player, who is built to exploit the game mechanics in FUT 18. He's an absolute game-changer, and a joy to use.
If you are reluctant to lock 250K into an untradeable player this early in FUT 18, and understandably so, look at it this way. This POTM card is a significant, significant boost over the base card. If (read: when) he gets an IF, it probably won't be this good, and if it is, it's going to go for far, far more than 250k. Considering that his base card was 80k before this SBC came out, I think a comparable IF card will be ~400k.
Furthermore, you are going to shell out pretty much the same amount for a comparable player. A common alternative would be Alexis Sanchez, but I feel like Mané is streets ahead of of Alexis in this game (it's the pace and power of Mané that gives him the W here).
Verdict: Worth it.
Summary
This is one of my favorite cards this year (after my all-time favorite, my lord and savior, the G.O.A.T., Anthony Martial). I think it plays perfectly to the game mechanics, and exploits them ruthlessly. You need your attacking players to be fast (did I mention he was fast?), good on the ball, have a good shot, and be able to hold their own in challenges, and Mané checks all of these boxes.
I know he's untradeable, and I know he's expensive (I guess you could say he costs a lot of Mané), but he's absolutely, absolutely worth it. This card will change your attack, and take your gameplay to the next level. An unreal player.
10/10 would recommend.
In the first month of FIFA 18, I'll be trying to review as many players as possible. If you have any suggestions on what players you want reviewed, or if you have any questions about the ones I have already reviewed, feel free to comment below, or send me a tweet (@Wookiechew23)!"

Welcome to another FIFA 17 MLS Team of the Season Futhead player review. Like with some of our other MLS ones, this review is a bit terser than usual in an effort to cover more ground.
In this review, we'll be looking at the TOTS Sebastian Giovinco. 

In-game stats and rating
The Atomic Ant has some incredible in-game stats:

Even without a chemistry style he has 96 acceleration, 93 sprint speed, 99 agility, 99 balance, 95 ball control, 93 dribbling, 94 positioning, 92 finishing, 91 long shots, 98 free kicks, 96 vision, 87 stamina and 85 aggression. Wow.
I used Finisher chemistry on him to give him a nice boost to his shooting and physicality. 

With this chemistry, he goes up to 97 shooting (with 97 finishing 99 shot power, 99 long shots) and 78 physical (with a measly 66 strength coupled with 95 aggression). I wanted to boost his strength as much as possible, which is why I went with this chemistry style. Originally, I had planned on using Architect, but I felt the shooting boost was necessary.
With Finisher, his in-game ratings are as follows:

He's a 89-rated ST and a 93-rated CAM and CF. Due to his low heading, hew as never going to be a very high-rated striker.
Squad
I used Giovinco in this squad: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7559972/

I used him at CAM in the 4231 formation. I make two small changes in-game -- I swap Dos Santos with Giovinco, and then swap Giovinco with Villa (so that Giovinco ends up at the RCAM position).
I used the squad above for 10 games, so I'll be basing my reviews on those 10 games. All games were played in Div. 1.
Stats
Here are my stats with TOTS Villa:
Games: 10
Goals: 11
Assists: 10
Chemistry Style: Finisher
As you can see, he hit the elusive double-double in the 10 games I used him.
Let's get into the review.
Review
Pace: 10/10
He could just about be The Flash; he's so unbelievably quick. Instant acceleration, both on and off the ball. Incredible sprint speed, both on and off the ball. His pace is deadly, and he can use to terrifying effect as he tears open defenses with ease. I didn't encounter a player who could keep up with him. He's genuinely the third fastest player I've used this year, after my beloved TOTS Dembele and my TOTS Hazard.
Shooting: 10/10
His finesse shots are nuts. Once again, they are the third best in the game, after TOTS Dembele and TOTS Hazard. He can whip it in, from any angle, and the curve he gets is ridiculous. I must have scored six of his 11 goals from the corner of the box, just by hitting those finesse shots into the top corner. It's like FIFA 12 all over again.
I loved his long shots too -- he cuts in, and then the world is his oyster. He can unleash a perfect finesse, or absolutely blast one towards the keeper. His shot power is unreal, and it causes all sorts of problems for the keeper. He hit the woodwork at least five times from outside the box, so his goal tally could have been much higher. Inside the box, this power, coupled with great positioning, finishing and volleys, make him an absolute nightmare. He's fantastic from close range, and can finish pretty much any chance that drops to him.
Passing: 10/10
You might be tired of hearing this, but once again, he's fantastic. His passing range is very, very good, and he can create chances both right in front of him, and at a distance. I loved getting into a little bit of space, thanks to his dribbling and pace, and then playing a perfect pass to an open team mate. His through balls were very good, and he set up Villa eight times. The other two assists were long range passes -- wonderfully floated and timed efforts that split open defenses. I have nothing but good things to say about his passing.
Dribbling: 11/10
""The dictionary defines superlative as: of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme.""
--- Michael Scott (as played by Steve Carrell), The Office Season 7.
Michael may not have known it, but that hilarious hyperbole nails TOTS Giovinco; he's that good. Effortless on the ball, never putting a foot wrong. Absolutely mesmerizing to use and watch. He can cause so many problems for the opponents, it's ridiculous. This man cannot be stopped -- he can easily wiggle his way through an entire team if he wanted to. Absolutely unreal.
Defending: N/A
He's a 5'4 (164 cm) attacker playing at right CAM. Let's give him a break.
Physical: 7/10
Surprisingly, he wasn't too weak. Still weak, still dominated at times, but he does win a lot of 50-50 challenges. This is probably down to his fantastic aggression, and if you think about it, 66 strength isn't all too bad. He still gets thrown off the ball a lot, and shielding is only partially effective, but it's surprisingly decent. I'd suggest playing him out wide, behind the forwards, or as part of a two-man strike force, just so that his lack of strength doesn't become a liability. His stamina is good, jumping is decent, and as mentioned, I really liked his aggression.
Weak foot: 9/10
Had absolutely no issues. Passing didn't feel limited by the weak foot, and he was decent when it came to shooting. As always, would have preferred the five-star weakfoot, so that he doesn't miss the occasional chance.
Skills: 9/10
He really doesn't need the five-star skills, but they would be nice. Four-star, with his pace and dribbling and shooting and passing, is more than enough.
Summary
I loved using this item, and of all the MLS TOTS, this is the one I will definitely keep. He's a little on the weaker side, but the rest of his stats are ridiculous, and he's so deadly in-game. There is a reason why he was at one point extinct on the Xbox One market; at around 200K, for that kind of ability, he's incredible value.
Rating: 9.5/10
Value for coins: 10/10"

Chomping at the bit for a pink-and-gold Ligue 1 right back? Prepare to get hyped.
Though many of us are busy with either the FIFA 18 beta (or complaining about not having it), the final FUTTIES Winner was unveiled in-game on Friday. In a bit of a twist, the winner was not Liverpool's Nathaniel Clyne. PSG's Serge Aurier could've become the ninth of ten Premier League FUTTIES champions, had rumored moves to Manchester United or Chelsea ever panned out. Instead, we'll have to settle for a final tally of eight, with Aurier and AS Roma's Alessandro Florenzi the lone exceptions to the rule.
That leads us to some closing thoughts on the FUTTIES promo as a whole -- Did it work for you? I'll admit personally going into the promotion, the idea of voting via Squad Building Challenges was awesome. It's tough to say whether the ability to vote for multiple players had any neglible impact on the resulting winners -- or the idea that the higher rated items would automatically be more desirable as they'd hypothetically reduce the cost to complete the SBCs as a whole.
EA have the data, and we may not know until next summer what their biggest takeaways were. I certainly commend them on breaking the tediousness of the previous promotions. The only question is whether the lack of diversity of winners proves they didn't quite go far enough.
You can see all that's necessary to complete the FUTTIES Winner Serge Aurier here."

Until the inception of FUT Champions, FIFA esports had been on the fringe of the industry. Marquee FIFA Ultimate Team competitions, like the 'Gfininty Play Like A Legend' tournaments, weren't able to gain traction - even though some of the best FIFA players in the world took part. Just 11 months later, it's a completely different story.
The in-built competitive game mode has sparked an interest in the esport amongst FIFA players, and also brought real-life football clubs into the mix. The Bundesliga's Vfl Wolfsburg were one of the first teams to sign esports players Benedikt Saltzer and Daniel Fink to the club in May 2015. A year later, the Premier League's West Ham United also entered the fray, signing Sean 'Dragon' Allen.
However, since then, a host of other professional teams have joined. Other Bundesliga and Premier League teams, like Schalke 04 and Manchester City, followed the example set by Wolfsburg and West Ham. French giants Paris Saint-Germain and 2017 Ligue 1 Champions AS Monaco joined last October. This February, Serie A club AS Roma partnered with Fnatic, a London-based organization and one of the biggest names in esports, to sign three players. The English YouTube-based football club Hashtag United, founded by Spencer 'Spencer FC' Owen, also field four players.
This is why this year's FIFA Interactive World Cup in London could be the game's most important event yet. With more than 10 players backed by teams from at least seven different professional football leagues, the competitive field is unlike any other. Moreover, it has the feel of the real sport itself.
FIFA Interactive Club World Cup Manager Adrian Roelli spoke on this subject in a recent interview with Goal.com's Chris Wheatley.
""We've seen a trend in FIFA esports in general that more and more clubs have taken this up, and have created their own teams,"" Roelli said. ""[We] obviously wanted to support them and tried to build the tournament that specifically targets these signed players and have them compete against each other.""
AS Roma's Aman Seddiqi, who qualified for the FIWC and both legs of the FUT Champions Americas regional finals and was one of the three players signed by the club in February, has taken notice of the rich pool of compeitors in London, but doesn't think the year's-worth of anticipation will affect the skill level.
""The amount of talent at the FIWC will make the tournament tight,"" Seddiqi said. ""The players have been playing at a high level since the beginning of [FIFA 17] so I think the timing won't affect the difference in skill. Most players know each other's playstyles so that is the one thing that changes with time.""
According to esportsearnings.com, a community-driven competitive gaming resource that compiles public information, the prize pool for FIFA 17 has already crossed the million dollar mark. This still pales in comparison to the bigger esports like League of Legends, but FIFA is on the rise among professional gamers.
""The FIWC is very significant this year, and it's really because of the prize pot,"" said YouTuber and FIFA community influencer Chu Morah, better known as ChuBoi, who is also one of the hosts of this year's event. ""It's the biggest grand prize in FIFA history."" 
The Berlin FIFA Ultimate Team Championships, hosted by EA Sports in May, boasted a $400,000 prize pool. This week's FIWC 2017 Champion, who will be crowned on Friday, will take home $200,000 alone, ten times the amount won by 2016 FIWC Champion Mohamad Al-Bacha.
""That shows that there's going to be more money going toward this as an esport,"" Morah said. ""Hopefully, more prize money gets given out in the future, because we do want to see these events be worth it for these pro players.""
Along with prize money, viewership is on an uptick too. Most of the FUT Champions regional grand finals were broadcast live on ESPN2. February's Paris Regional, which pitted Europe's best players against each other, was re-broadcast on ESPN's flagship network. 
With its release just over a month away, FIFA 18 could ostensibly reach even bigger audiences thanks to the stage set by its previous iteration."

Are you ready to help choose a program legend in FIFA Mobile?

-- For 24 hours, you'll be able to vote for which of the seven Tour Masters you want to be the Program Legend.
-- You'll then be able to vote (through a Twitter poll) for which one of three possible positions you want that player at. Choose your player first carefully! Defensive players will be limited to defensive kind of positions, and offensive players to the sort of places they might actually play in real life (e.g. no Manolas at ST, Lacazette at CDM, etc).
-- Finally, you'll have one last chance to shape the player by voting on Twitter for their secondary boost. Which boosts are available to choose between will be announced then.
To really add to the fun, Futhead and EA will be giving away the Program Legend to three lucky winners. You'll have up to three chances to enter on social media, so stay tuned tomorrow to be sure to give yourself the best shot to win the 99-overall player item.

FIFA Mobile's second Community Team of the Week is here. For the second time in as many weeks, the No. 1 ranked player in the game's Attack Mode Vs's been honored by having the cTOTW fashioned around their club. Following a monopolistic run by SirLe, his Royals teammate 'hunterkiller' gets the nod this go around.
After Luka Modric got a nice 96-overall player item sporting boosts a week ago, this week Chelsea (though perhaps not for long) CDM Nemanja Matic gets top billing. Matic had been tapped as as one of the previous iteration of Attack Mode's month of May Master Players. While that item has a lower overall rating (and is untradeable), it showcases  more advantageous boosts. Some FM enthusiasts will surely either gamble Matic gets June's Player of the Month or consider replacing his lower overall-rated version with the new one with slightly more modest boosts.
Last week's Team of the Week had the highest drop rate of any in the game's second-wave of TOTW releases requiring virtually no sniping (other than to ensure lower costs). With the market appearing to have been altered earlier today to curb auto-buyers, it remains to be seen how building the month's final TOTW plan will be impacted.
We'll also have to wait until next week to learn what beyond the two tokens and the recipient of Player of the Month are necessary to build a possible 99-overall super item of either Matic or Modric.
Which do you hope to see?
Here's the players that make up this week's FIFA Mobile Community Team of the Week:
82 RB Pablo Zabaletta
83 CM Vicente Iborra de la Fuente
85 LB Marcelo Vieira da Silva

First Canada's birthday. Now America's.
Another early morning FIFA Mobile Program release sees a 97-overall rated John Anthony Brooks enter the fray of top-rated centerbacks in the game. And while nowhere near as high-octane, a 94-overall CAM Christian Pulisic (aka the American Messi) will certainly pique some's interests.
Once again, this program is packs only. But unlike the Canada Day one that just ended, you're not guaranteed a player in these packs. You can redeem Stripe Tokens (also available in the packs) to get one of the Fourth of July players or to get Star Tokens. You will need all five players and five Star Tokens to unlock the 97 OVR Brooks.
There's also supposed to be a Martial token available for those still chasing the Mobile Master Anthony Martial.
The plan and players should both be available on Futhead later today.
Happy Fourth of July, Americans."

The hype is real.
The first round of FUTTIES nominations are here.
Expected every Friday and Tuesday for the rest of the Summer, you'll have 72 hours to vote by completing the corresponding Squad Building Challenge followed by 72 hours to do the Winner's SBC.
A pair of Manchester United (and FUT favorites) Eric Bailly and Chris Smalling are joined by FC Barcelona's Samuel Umtiti, who's just wrapping up his first year with the club, as the nominees for this year's ""Favourite Centerback"".
Remember, the only way to vote is by completing the corresponding SBC in-game. You'll get a pink untradeable item of the player whose SBC you do for your troubles. It's very conceivable that item could be needed to complete the winner's upgraded SBC.
You can see what it'll take to complete the first three FUTTIES SBCs here."

Whether you’re looking for a new player to plug into your squad to improve your Squad Battles finish or you’re staring at the the first FUT Champions Weekend League as it looms closer, cheaper is always better, right?
Finding those cheap beasts to plug into your squad to get an instant upgrade without spending all of your coins can be half of the fun of FUT. This year, there are cheap beasts across all of the primary leagues to squeeze into even the most complicated of hybrid squads. 
Here are five of my favorite cheap beasts this year:
Marco Parolo (CM, Lazio)
The box to box center midfielder from Lazio has been my favorite inexpensive Calcio A midfielder since launch day. His shot power (87) and long shots (86) are unbelievable for an 81 rated player and his 88 stamina will keep him going from box to box all game long without any issues. 
He’s got the ability to make long passes through to attacking players and his item is extremely well rounded defensive with standing tackle, interceptions and slide tackling all 80-rated or above. Parolo has a four-star weak foot and three-star skills, to boot.
I snagged him for around 1,500 coins after a minute or so of sniping a week ago, but he goes for around 3,000 coins on Xbox One and around 4,000 coins on PS4 at the moment.
Roque Mesa (CDM, Swansea)
I was fairly shocked to see Mesa’s face stats on his card when I first saw him this year. They’re extremely sound for an 82-rated CDM, especially one in the premier league with a strong nation. When I saw that he was practically going for discard at launch, I picked him up and slid him into my starter squad to see what he was all about. 
He’s got above average pace (77) for a CDM and 92 aggression paired with 92 stamina to make him a pest in the center of the pitch for opposing attackers. His passing is sound and he’s fine at advancing the pay after winning the ball back, but Mesa does have a few flaws to be aware of if you’re considering him for the Weekend League or Squad Battles.
He’s only 5’7 and his heading accuracy is just 32, so winning balls in the air is almost out of the question. Still, he’s an extremely affordable option for anyone who needs an aggressive tackler in their side for less than 2,000 coins.
Mesa currently goes for around 1,000 coins on both consoles.
Joe Hart (GK, West Ham)
While we’re on the topic of Premier League players, let’s talk about goalkeepers. Perhaps the most taboo position for players since launch, finding the right goalkeeper has been a frustrating task for many players. 
If you’re like most players and unable to afford a game-changing keeper like David De Gea or Manuel Neuer, height may be your best attribute to bet on this year. Taller goalkeepers with sound reaction and diving stats have been successful options for me in FIFA 18.
Joe Hart fits the bill in the Premier League. While he may not be the Jack Butland of FIFA 17 in FIFA 18, Hart’s 6’5 frame with 83 diving and 83 reactions will serve as an upgrade in net over other cheaper goalkeepers. Hart goes for around 3,000 coins on both consoles at the moment, but he’ll surely rise as we creep closer to the first Weekend League.
Ruben Semedo (CB, Villarreal)
Another non-rare card, Semedo is the cheapest player on this list. Pace is the most sought after stat on center backs for players this year with manual defending serving as a challenge for many early on.
Semedo’s 72 pace, which is boosted to 79 with an anchor card, make him a sound defender for your La Liga back line. He’s 6’2 and has 85 jumping so winning balls in the air is a cinch for the Portuguese CB. His defense, with the anchor card, has 85-plus stats including 88 standing tackle and he has a three-star weak foot that you can rely on.

Semedo goes for under 1,000 coins on both consoles and can even be sniped for discard if you’re patient enough.
Jean Michael Seri (CM, OGC Nice)
Ligue 1 is a fantastic place to look for cheap beasts early in the game. In my opinion, it’s the best bang for your buck for starter squads, but it’s not as deep of a player pool as you’ll find in the other primary leagues.
Still, there are plenty of over-powered players to build around. For me, Jean Michael Seri is where to start. With 80 pace and proficient passing statistics, Seri is able to play up and down the pitch. He can defend, dribble, and pass with the best center midfielders in Ligue 1, but you may want to hold off on shooting with Seri unless you put a finisher or deadeye chem style on him. 
His high-high workrates and four-star weak foot make him a joy to play with in the middle of the park. He goes for around 3,000 coins on Xbox One and around 4,000 coins on PS4."

The annual FUTTIES, now for FIFA 17, kicked off Friday with two new ""End of an Era"" Squad Building Challenges featuring AS Roma and Italian legend Francesco Totti and Feyenoord's Dutch maestro Dirk Kuyt. 
These are the first two of its kind, with four more on the way; the others will be released two-at-a-time over the next two Fridays, per EA's Yahsir Qureshi.
This move, at least for Totti, was pretty much expected. We didn't know what the version of the card would be called, but respect was due. Totti spent the entirety of his professional career, an incredible 28 years, at Roma. He first joined at the age of 13, and is the highest goalscorer and most capped player in the club's history. His 96-rated CF card looks pretty tasty and it very well may be the last item he ever receives in FUT, unless he comes back as an Icon, of course.
Kuyt, on the other hand, was a bit of a journeyman but always a stalwart in the Dutch national team. He played for five clubs over the course of his career but ended up finishing with a two-year stint at Feyenoord, a club he'd played for between the years of 2003 and 2006. He secured Feyenoord's 2017 league title with a hat-trick in the final game of the season.
The cards and SBCs will be available until July 14."

The initial FIFA 18 reveal has happened and whilst we still haven't seen everything that FIFA 18 has to offer, here's what we know so far:
Legends for PS4 and PC
Xbox's 4 year exclusive deal has expired, meaning that with a slight re brand, Legends will now be available on Xbox One, PlayStation4 and PC, known as FUT Icons, including probably the saught after addition to the line up, R9.

3 Editions
As ever there will be multiple editions available including loan Christiano Ronaldo and Ronaldo Nazário items, 8 special edition kits, early access and TOTW loan packs, depending on which edition you spring for:

Legacy Edition
There will still be a legacy edition available for PS3 and Xbox 360:

So not tonnes of news out of the gate but the expiration of the Xbox deal opening Legends/Icons up to PS4 and PC players is worthy of a tonne of fanfare in itself, and with EA Play just around the corner, it won't be long before we've got plenty more detail regarding the changes for FIFA 18."

The stage is set for the 2017 FIFA Interactive World Cup in London, and this year's 32-player field could not get tougher. In addition to the tight competition, the event is set to be the biggest in the esport's history.
The build-up to this event has been more outstanding than in years past. The FIFA 17 Ultimate Team Championship Series, which was hosted by EA Sports from February through May, narrowed the field greatly and brought the best players to the forefront. After coming out on top in the Berlin Grand Final, Frenchman Corentin 'Vitality RocKy' Chevrey currently holds the title for the best FIFA player in the world. However, his reign at the top might be the most short-lived one yet, unless he can repeat his stellar performance from May.
At this year's FIWC, Germany is the most heavily represented country, with six players, while England comes in at second, fielding five. France and Brazil each have three.
Of England's five players, four were heavily showcased in the FUT Champions regional finals. Hashtag United's Tassal 'Hashtag Tass' Rushan, won the first regional final in Paris from the Xbox division, which pitted Europe's best players against each other.
""Tass knows how big this event is for him, and the FIFA esports space in general, so he has been putting in lots of extra hours to ensure he is ready to play at his best for the finals,"" said Sebastian Carmichael-Brown, the commercial director and owner of Hashtag United. ""He also has the benefit of his experience from winning the Paris Regional earlier in the year, against a phenomenal field, to draw up on to. This experience should serve him well on the big stage.""
On the Playstation side, Englishman Shaun 'xShellzz' Springette, who surprised everyone with his performance in Berlin, finished as the runner-up at the FUT Champions Grand Final. This time, however, he won't catch his opponents off-guard.
""A lot of people were not able to keep up with 'xShellzz' and his 4-4-2 formation,"" said YouTuber and FIFA Community Influencer Chu 'ChuBoi' Morah, who is also one of the host's at this year's event. ""Maybe they can expect more from him this time, but if he can take that form and bring it here to London, I think that'll be amazing.""
Madrid Regional Finalist Spencer 'Unilad Gorilla' Ealing, is still considered by many to be the best FIFA player in the world, despite having yet to lift a trophy in 2017. Chris 'THEE BULLOCK' Bullock rose to prominence as a dark horse during the Paris FUT Champions regional, and has not lost that reputation since.
Paris Saint-Germain's Brazilian superstar -- no, not Neymar - Rafael 'Rafifa13' Fortes -- on the Xbox side, is also a name to watch out for. He has received many plaudits, from commentators and analysts alike, since his dominating display at the FUT Champions Miami Regional. He features in Group Two of the division, alongside Tass, 'Vitality RocKy,' and Bullock. According to Morah, the group could decide the winner of the entire tournament.
Apart from the high-profile players, Morah is confident there will be one surprise candidate to emerge from that group - and he's tipping AFC Ajax's Dani Hagebeuk to be one to do just that.
""I think the winner of this competition is coming out of that group,"" Morah said. ""If I have a guess as to who makes it out, I would say it's between [Vitality RocKy], Tass, and Dani. Dani's form has been really consistently good, and he's got a lot of confidence right now.""
The tournament is set to kick off at 7 a.m. ET Wednesday, and the 'Final Showdown' is scheduled to start at 11 a.m. ET Friday."

What are Marquee Matchups?
In FIFA 17, EA introduced us to ""Marquee Matchups"". This was a semi-regular, mostly weekly or biweekly Squad Buildling Challenge that highlighted the key real life matches for the coming week. Typically there were four Marquee Matchups, each with a separate SBC to complete in an SBC series. The SBC for each matchup usually required a handful of players from either of the two teams, from the league, and/or from the nation that the teams play in. In the beginning of the year, the rewards included halfway decent packs, but towards the end of the year, the group reward often included a guaranteed guaranteed Team of the Week pack. 
At first the release date varied, but as FIFA 17 progressed, Thursdays at 6 p.m. UK time marked the drop of the new SBC (special Champs League/Europa versions dropped Mondays). This year, the first Marquee Matchup was posted on a Tuesday at 6 p.m. UK. While we know for sure that Tuesdays will be the regular release time for FIFA 18, it would make sense for EA to move the old date from Thursday to make room for Throwback Thursday SBCs. 
Why Does it Matter?
So what? Why bother guessing which matches are “Marquee” every week? Last year, a popular investing method was to predict the Marquee Matchups for the coming week and to invest in players from those teams. It appears that this will be a viable method again this year. While margins have certainly shrunk as the method grew in popularity, there is still profit to be made. We’ll go more in-depth on investing for the SBC later, but let’s first talk about this week’s predictions. 
Top Picks
At the end of the day, only four matchups are included in the SBC. Here is are the four that we think are most likely.
England vs Slovenia 
Match Info: EA loves the Premier League. They never seem to baulk whenever they can include Premier League players in their SBC requirements, especially during the international break. England gives them this option.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each nation


Team Chemistry: Min. 75 chemistry


Argentina vs Peru
Match Info: A huge match in the South American World Cup qualifiers! These two teams are looking to secure their places in Moscow and are only separated by goal difference with one match left to play after their Friday clash.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 rated 


Player Requirement: 3 players from either nation(s)



Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry 


USA vs Panama
Match Info: To the north we go. This weekend it’s huge matchup for the US and Panama. Winner will be one step closer to Russia, while the loser will lose control of their fate. With EA looking to involve their North American fan base, this is a solid shout. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each nation


Team Chemistry: Min. 80 chemistry


Melbourne Victory vs Sydney FC 
Match Info: Marquee Matchup fans will remember this cash cow from last year. However, get in quick with your investments because the Big Blue derby could generate serious hype.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 80 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
There’s never four clear locks for Marquee Matchups, and we would not be doing our due diligence as investors if we didn’t consider additional fixtures:

Scotland vs Slovakia
Match Info: Honestly, this was a tough drop to sleeper as it could easily compete with the aforementioned ENG vs SLO match.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each nation


Team Chemistry: Min. 80 chemistry


Northern Ireland vs Germany
Match Info: Germany can officially book their ticket to Russia with this match against Northern Ireland. Plus, considering the Bundesliga was snubbed last week, don’t sleep on this fixture.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 player from each nation 


Team Chemistry: Min. 70 chemistry 


Iceland vs Turkey
Match Info: UEFA Group I is anyone's game at the moment, and a significant matchup between the two and three spots in the group could see this matchup sneak into the SBC. Very little hype and strong upside make this worth an investor’s consideration.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each nation


Team Chemistry: Min. 70 chemistry


Investing Strategies
Now that laid out some possible matches, it's talk about some investing strategies to help you amass your FUT fortunes. Before delving into the comprehensive methods, here are three basic tips:
-- Prioritize investing in players who are members of the two teams featuring in a specific Marquee Matchup (higher rated the better)
-- Non-Rare cards usually have a higher return on investment
-- Certain positions such as LB/RB, CMs and STs are generally more profitable 
It is important to have the three preceding principles in mind. However, depending on the caliber of the matchup, other techniques can be employed with less risk and greater rewards. Here are some examples:
High Popularity & High Required Rating
These matchup feature teams from leagues with massive global appeal and team overall requirements in and around the 80 mark. EA usually stick to leagues like the Premier Leageu and La Liga for these caliber of matchups. Our recommendation for this tier, is to invest in niche players from the featured teams, or in the highest rated non-rares from around the league. Stay away from the rare cards when possible.  

High Popularity & Low Required Rating
A fixture where the game is between two teams in a major league; however, the overall requirement is no higher than 78. For this category, investing in players rated 82 of higher is not recommended, since the best bang for your buck will be picking up non-rares that follow Tip 3.

Low Popularity & High Required Rating
A lot of matchups end up in this category. Teams/nations that feature a lot of gold options but lack global appeal. Typically, a matchup in this category tends to have the highest reward possibility when it comes to investing. 

Low Popularity & Low Required Rating
Embodied by some of the deep sleepers, these matchups feature teams from less desirable leagues, such as the lower divisions of England or the Hyundai-A league. Here, most players are silver or bronze. That being said, there is a high profit ceiling in these markets with relatively low risk. Our main tip is to pick up the highest rated card from either team, or the highest rated non-rares from the league."

Even with Tuesdays and Fridays being the big release days for FUTTIES this year, Wednesday showcases a couple additions to FIFA 17 Ultimate Team worth a note.
New Marquee Transfer SBCs, showcasing loan versions of high profile transfers, are now live. If you're chomping at the bit to see how a non-inform version of Lukaku stacks up at Manchester United without dropping 100,000 coins, you're now free to. Wayne Rooney's return to Everton, Pepe's Turkish league move to Besitkas as well as Antonio Rudiger's relocation to Chelsea -- a bit unexpectedly at centerback after being announced by CFC as a rightback -- are all represented as well. You can find those in-game now.
There are some additional less prominent transfers in the game as well. We'll get those added to Futhead as we're able. You'll be able to find them in the latest players section.
Last but not least, speaking of loans, a few SBCs from the past are back -- but only in loanable versions. If you're interested in trying out Player of the Month Ibrahimovic or Futmas De Rossi, you can now do so."

A very difficult set of games last week saw us struggle mightily and only manage one of the five games correct, just a week after a perfect 4/4, no less. With this being the last week of the season for the Premier League and Bundesliga, we see two very important games feature from them, along with some other tough games which aren’t much easier to pick. So, let’s get into this weeks games.

Swansea v Stoke
We start off with a must-win game for Swansea, whose narrow defeat against Southampton on Tuesday night leaves them in the relegation zone and three points behind the Saints and safety with one game to play.
Swansea need to win, and win big. They sit three points behind Southampton and know that a big win is their only chance of Premier League survival. Swansea had an excellent couple of months back in January and February, but a big dip in form has seen them pick up just three points from their last nine games. Things may have been easier for the Swans had Huddersfield not managed to squeeze out a surprise draw against Chelsea on Wednesday night, which managed to guarantee their Premier League future for another year. Two months and just three points from nine games since their last win shows just how desperate their plea is.
Stoke accomplished a surprising feat in being relegated before West Brom after their loss to Crystal Palace last weekend. A run of almost three and a half months without a win shows just how dismal they have been, and they will no doubt be hoping to end the season with some sort of dignity. They have the worst away form in the league, with just 10 points and one win in their 18 previous home games this season.
Games between these two are normally pretty close, with the home side often coming out on top. This is a very tough game to call, with Swansea obviously needing to go all out for the win, which may then leave them open at the back. I feel like Swansea’s desire to win, along with their fans being behind them, will give them the edge.
Game played: Sunday 13th, 3:00 p.m. (BST) / 10:00 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Swansea win

Real Betis v Sevilla
The two teams from Seville face off in a game that will play a big part in La Liga’s Europa League representatives for next season. Betis sit five points and three places above their rivals, with Sevilla just inside the Europa League places in seventh.
Betis have had an incredible second half of the season, with the fourth best record since the winter break and have already guarantees themselves a place in next season’s Europa League. Since signing Bartra in January, only Barca and the two Madrid sided have won more points than Betis, which has put them in a well deserved fifth place in the league. A disappointing defeat to Bilbao last weekend was their first loss in nine, a run that saw them keep six clean sheets in eight games. On top of that an injury to Adán, their first choice keeper, leaves him very unlikely to play this weekend and is a big blow for the hosts.
Sevilla’s season almost mirrors their rivals, having had an excellent start to that season and a dismal run since January. Since beating Manchester United in the Champions League in March, Sevilla went on a run of nine games without a win, finally putting an end to that run last weekend and followed it up with a surprise win over Real Madrid during the week, just to make things that bit tougher to predict. Away from home, they have conceded twice as many goals as they have scored, picking up just 19 points from 18 games, which they will be hoping to improve on.
Betis came out on top in an eight goal thriller when the two first faced off back in January, winning 5-3 in their first victory over their rivals in four years. Sevilla know that their fate is now in their own hands, and with eighth place Getafe hosting Atletico Madrid on Saturday, this game could guarantee them at least a qualifier in the Europa League. Moreover, with Villarreal hosting Real Madrid in the last week of the season, they could manage a big comeback and automatically qualify for the competition that they have won three times in the past four seasons. 
I'm going for a Sevilla win, but this could easily go either way, and I feel like Adán’s fitness may play a big part in the outcome, so it may be best to wait and see what news comes out about him.
Game played: Saturday 12th, 5:30 p.m. (BST) / 12:30 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Sevilla win

Hoffenheim v Dortmund
Next we have a Champions League decider, with Dortmund, Hoffenheim and Leverkusen all battling it out for the last automatic Champions League spot and the playoff spot.
Fourth place Hoffenheim are in a very good run of form, with just one loss in their last ten games. They know that a win this weekend by two or more goals will be enough to see them finish ahead of their opponents and get an automatic Champions League spot next year. With manager Nagelsmann having been linked with Dortmund in recent months, the young German will be hoping to add another big scalp to his already impressive record. Even without Gnabry, they still have the in form duo of Kramaric and Uth to try and get the goals they need.
Dortmund will no doubt just be wanting this season to end, with countless ups and downs and a disappointing campaign both domestically and internationally. Their last three games alone sum up their season, with the same starting XI cruising to victory over Leverkusen and then drawing with Bremen and losing to Mainz. Their recent run of away games has been poor, with just two goals scored and three draws from their last five Bundesliga games on the road. Anything better than a loss by one goal will be enough for Dortmund to get into the Champions League again, but a positive result will no doubt be all they are aiming for to try and end this season on some sort of high.
You have to go back to 2013 to find the last time Hoffenheim beat Dortmund, with five draws and five wins for Dortmund since. This is very tough to call, with Hoffenheim seeming to be the obvious pick, but Dortmund's ability to show up for random games being so unpredictable they could easily come out fighting and take all three points. I feel like the most logical result is a Hoffenheim win, so that's what I'm saying, even though I hope for the opposite result.
Game played: Saturday 12th, 2:30 p.m. (BST) / 9:30 a/p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Hoffenheim win

Spartak Moscow v Dinamo Moscow
Two of Moscow’s teams face off in the last matchday of the Russian league season. 
Spartak will be hoping to win to seal their place in next season's Champions League with a win over their city rivals. They suffered three defeats on the bounce which put an end to their title ambitions, but two wins since have seen them keep their European hopes for next season in their own hands. They have the best home record in the league this season, picking up 32 points in their 14 home games so far this season. 
Dinamo Moscow sit in 10th, but still face a slight threat of relegation as they are three points and eight goals ahead of Amkar, who occupy the last relegation playoff spot. They have been in good away form in recent months, winning three of their last four games, but face a very tough opponent this week. 
Just looking at the table and form, this game looks like it will only go one way. Combine that with the fact that Dinamo have only come out on top in one of the last 12 meetings between these two teams and it looks like a pretty one sided game, so I’m following that trend and going for a home win
Game played: Sunday 13th, 12:00 p.m. (BST) / 7:00 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Spartak win

Roma v Juventus
Now onto the biggest game of the weekend, with Roma trying to stop Juventus winning the title.
Roma have had a great season, and a win this weekend would top off their season and guarantee them a spot in the Champions League qualifiers at least. They have been a great team to watch, and more than capable of causing an upset - just ask Barcelona. With 34 points from 18 home games this season, they haven’t been at their best all year, but a run of four straight wins in the league has seen them keep third place in the table, just ahead of Lazio and Inter Milan.
After Napoli beat them and looked like they had blown the title race wide open again, the Naples team has struggled and Juventus now need just one point from their last two games to seal their seventh straight title. They boast the best away record in the league, picking up 45 points from a possible 54 so far, along with the best defence and attack in the league. They suffered a slight dip in form a few games ago, but since losing to Napoli, they have scored 10 in three games, including big wins over both AC and Inter Milan.
The two teams are tough to split, with the away side winning only once in the last seven years of games between them. The hosts tend to have a big advantage, and the bookies are also showing Roma as slight favourites for this match. This is probably the toughest game to call, but I feel like a draw will favour both teams and that’s what I’m going with.
Game played: Sunday 13th, 7:45 p.m. (BST) / 2:45 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw

We are back to a specific player reward this week, and that player is Clement Lenglet of Sevilla, who boasts some very solid stats if you plan on using him, or a good French/La Liga mix if you wnat to use him for an SBC. If you don’t manage to get four results correct, or you simply don’t want to pick him up, you can get some Skill Boosts instead to move you closer to the next level.
As always, good luck and happy predicting!"

Accompanying the various other FUTTIES releases on Friday, the four biggest transfers of the 2017 summer window have landed in FIFA Ultimate Team.
Arsenal's brand new French forward Alexandre Lacazette, Bayern Munich's French midfielder Corentin Tolisso, Manchester City's Portuguese right-midfielder Bernardo Silva, and Liverpool's rapid Egyptian right-winger Mohamed Salah have all been moved to their new teams.
The full tradeable version of the four players are also available in packs and will surely hit the transfer market soon. However, EA have also accompanied this release with four respective Squad Building Challenges. The caveat there is that the SBCs only gift a loan-version of the player, for FUT players to test drive before dipping into their coin balance.
Be sure to stay tuned to Futhead's Latest Players page as we'll be adding other new transfer items as they come in."

Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad Link:http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7676702/


Goalkeeper
Tim Howard - GK - 81 OVR
There were only a handful of options in terms of gold keepers, one of which was Howard who made a total of six saves for Colorado during their 0-0 away draw against FC Dallas
Defenders
Ben Davies - LB - 78 OVR
With Tottenham failing to make any signings it could be an interesting season for them. They do still have one of the best sides in the division though and with a comfortable 2-0 away win over Newcastle to start their campaign there were no signs of them struggling. Davies scored the second of the two goals alongside helping to keep the clean sheet.
Pepe - CB - 88 OVR
Pepe started his life at Besiktas in style, scoring one of their two goals in a 2-0 home win over Antalyaspor. It could have been that much better with the Portuguese defender also hitting the woodwork, regardless of that though i still expect him to be involved in the side. #ComeToBesiktas
Marcano - CB - 79 OVR
A bit of a punt now for the final defender seeing as Porto played mid-week for this specific selection. Marcano managed a goal and a clean sheet though and seeing as he was one of only a few gold defenders to manage that it will only work in his favour.
Midfielders
Neymar - LW - 92 OVR
PSG managed a 3-0 away win over Guingamp with both Neymar and Cavani grabbing a goal and an assist to go alongside an 8 from L'equipe. I am going with Neymar as a goal and assist from ST is pushing it. Neymar doesn’t have any space left but with a transfer it could easily be a re-release of one of his Barca items.
Blerim Dzemaili - CM - 74 OVR
Dzemaili is now set to pick up his third IF of the year after scoring another brace from midfield. This time it came in Montreal's 3-0 away win over Philadelphia in arguably his best performance for the club to date.
Granit Xhaka - CM - 84 OVR
Despite Arsenals superb late comeback which saw them beat Leicester 4-3 there’s not actually an easy selection for TOTW. Xhaka grabbed two assists from central midfield though and I fully expect an Arsenal IF to appear from the match so I will take the punt on that player being Xhaka.
Dorlan Pabon - RM - 00 OVR
There are contrasting positions for Pabon this weekend but with the official Liga MX website stating that he started RM thats a safe bet. As to why I have selected the Colombian comes down to his attacking presence, scoring once and assisting another two in Monterrey's 4-1 win.
Forwards
Abel Hernandez - ST - 76 OVR
On paper Hull look like one of the strongest sides in the Championship and so far they have not done anything to prove that wrong. They recorded a 4-1 home win on Saturday over Burton Albion of which Hernandez scored three of the goals.
Romelu Lukaku - ST - 84 OVR
Lukaku was never going to flop seeing as he was already proven in the Premier league, the question instead was just how well will he do. He set off his campaign with a brace against the heavily reinforced West Ham during a 4-0 United win, a result which sees them take an early lead.
Falcao - ST - 82 OVR
Monaco made it two wins from two courtest of a Falcao hat trick in a 4-1 away win over Dijon. As a result of that they look set to pick up back to back IF's with Jemerson being the previously player to make the cut
Substitutes
Bram Castro - GK - 70 OVR
Ajax were shocked away at Heracles as they left with no points with the home side winning 2-1. Castro played a huge part in the result making a total of 10 saves which saw him pick up an 8/10 which for a keeper in Holland really should see him in.
Justin Morrow - LWB - 00 OVR
This ones a little debatable in terms of positioning but I believe that it was a LWB role and in which case Morrow is almost a certainty for the side, scoring twice in Toronto's 4-1 home win. It does largely depend on how EA view the position though.
Andreas Bouchalakis - CM - 72 OVR
I have predicted several English league players this week and a couple could easily miss out due to league spread. One of those could be Bouchalakis but with a brace in a 4-3 in for Nottingham the Greek midfielder has a good shout.
Davit Skhirtladze - CAM - 59 OVR
Not one of the stand out players of the week in terms of FUT but with two goals and an assist to his name he deserves a spot in the side. Silkeborg went on to win the match by the convincing score line of four goals to one.
Jack Marriot - ST - 62 OVR
Peterborough look like a dangerous side this season from their early results, recording a 4-1 away win over Bristol Rovers on Saturday. Marriot was the stand out player from the match scoring three of Posh's four goals.
Steve Mounie- ST - 72 OVR
Surprisingly Huddersfield led the Premier league after the Saturday games were finished, thanks to a 3-0 away win over Palace. Quite the star to their PL life. New signing Mounie stood out scoring two of the three goals making him an easy selection for the side.
Sam Vokes - ST - 73 OVR
Burnley caused the upset of the weekend with a 3-2 away win over Chelsea of which they lead 3-0 in. Chelsea did end the match with nine men but credit should be given to Burnley for capitalising on the situation! Vokes was the stand out player scoring two of the three goals.
Reserves
Henrikh Mkhitaryan - CAM - 85 OVR
Two United players could be pushing it but with several top performances from them its not impossible. Lukaku, as already predicted is the obvious choice but with the Armenian midfielder also picking up two assists he could also make the final cut.
Thomas Mangani - CM - 75 OVR
With a few of the top leagues still not in action I expect all the French leagues high ratings to be included in the side, Mangani was included in those after claiming an 8/10 for his goal and assist in Angers 2-0 win
Timofey Kalachev - RW - 74 OVR
Kalachev usually occupies a defensive role and despite that regularly finds himself contributing attackingly. This time he started on the bench before being subbed on at RW. Once again, he played a part, scoring twice and assisting another and in turn making a case for a RW spot in the side.
Aiden McGeady - LM - 75 OVR
One of the bigger games in the Championship saw Norwich host Sunderland and it was the recently relegated black cats who came out on top. McGeady was involved in two of three Sunderland goals with both a goal and assist in a 3-1 away win.
Ricky Van Wolfswinkel - ST - 73 OVR
Several strikers scored twice this week which makes this spot that much more difficult. Any one of the said strikers could make the cut but realistically only one will. The one I have opted for is RVW who seems to be at a different club each time I see him. This time he is over in Switzerland, scoring twice for Basel in their 3-2 win over Grasshoppers"

If you're looking for the latest FIFA Mobile info to get you on into the weekend, it's here.
The boosts you were acucstomed to getting in-game for the first 2/3 of FIFA Mobile Season 1 have been replaced somewhat by actual in-game items you can get to level up corresponding stats. 
Much as you can train players to improve their overall, you'll be able to upgrade Skill Boosts as well, to give your squad even bigger and better statistical upgrades.
Also like training, a few ""Pre-Season"" players from S1 will give you a jump start to get going with Skill Boost progress come Season 2's launch: David Luiz, Edinson Cavani, Darijo Srna, David Silva, and Henrikh Mkhitaryan all deliver Skill Boost rewards to get going in S2 on the right foot.
So what do you think about the latest nugget of info for FIFA Mobile Season 2? Changes can seem overwhelming in a vacuum, but once they get here, you might just wonder how you ever played the game without them."

UPDATE, 20 June: The update's available now for both next gen consoles.

The ninth title update for FIFA 17 is now live on PC, bringing with it a monster of a bug, where the wall won't disband.
Whilst we'd normally expect this update to follow on PS4 and Xbox One early next week, it's possible those will be held back to address this and another update will come out for PC soon.
Here's what's been fixed:

General stability fixes

Ultimate Team: 

An issue where a player would be incorrectly awarded a loss after a disconnect in FUT Champions
Addressed a text overlap in FUT Champions leaderboard.

Gameplay:

Addressed an issue where players will freeze when using an offside trap."

After the launch of the ‘Retro Stars’ promo last week, we have quickly moved on to our second trio of players from previous plans who will now receive a tasty upgrade to their old item.
Following on from the first set of players to be upgraded, the featured players this time are the MLS Cup, Golden Boy award and EAster, as EA progress through the list of past events.
This weeks upgradeable players come in the form of:


84 rated MLS Cup Laurent Ciman - a former staple in the majority of FIFA Mobile squads may be set for a return as be is boosted to 92 rated;


Bayern's young star Renato Sanches’ 85 rated Golden Boy  moves to a very nice 94 overall;


Kyle Walker’s EAster 94 rated promo card, which looks set to become the best RWB in the game by a large margin as he moves to 97 overall. 


Looking forward, who would you want to see get an upgrade? Maybe some of other past ‘legends’ like Team Hero Aurelien Chedjou, or International Champion Eric Bailly? We can keep hoping, and wait patiently to see who is released this time next week."

This is the last of the MLS All-Star cards that I will be reviewing over the next few days. In order to review as many of the cards as possible, the reviews will be slightly shorter than usual.
In this review, we'll be looking at the TOTS Giovani Dos Santos. 

In-game stats and rating
Dos Santos has some very good attacking and creative stats.

Without a chemistry style, he has 93 acceleration, 91 sprint speed, 91 positioning, 90 finishing, 91 shot power, 90 long shots, 90 volleys, 96 agility, 97 balance, 92 ball control and dribbling, and 83 stamina.
I used the Hawk chemistry style on him, to boost his pace and shooting, as well as to give him a physical boost.

The chemistry style boosts him to 97 pace and shooting (with 99 positioning, shot power and long shots, as well as 95 finishing), and up to 70 physical (with 60 strength and 75 aggression).
With Hawk, he becomes a 91-rated ST, 92-rated CF, and a 90-rated CAM.

Squad
I used Dos Santos in this squad:

I used him at LCAM in the 4231 formation. I make two small changes in-game -- I swap Dos Santos with Giovinco, and then swap Giovinco with Villa (so that Giovinco ends up at the RCAM position).
I used the squad above for 10 games, so I'll be basing my reviews on those 10 games. All games were played in Div. 1.
Stats
Here are my stats with TOTS Dos Santos:
Games: 10
Goals: 5
Assists: 2
Chemistry Style: Hawk
As you can see, not very impressive. I even moved him to ST at times, just to see if I could get him more involved in the game, but to no avail.
Let's get into the review.
Review
Pace: 10/10
Credit where credit is due -- he's very, very fast. On that left hand side of the field, he's untouchable. I really enjoyed his acceleration -- it caused all sorts of problems for my opponents, and once he got into a pocket of space, he was away. Simply uncatchable.
Shooting: 6/10
This is where things get really weird.
He just didn't get into position, and when I did force him into position, he couldn't convert. His stats are incredible, but he didn't live up to it. He fired easy chances wide, failed to make the simplest runs, and couldn't hit the target from distance. His shooting really, really let me down. He did score 5 goals for me, but they were all simple tap-ins, with the exception of one physics-defying long shot off the weak foot. 
Passing: 7/10
Average at best, for a player with his stats. He was consistent when it came to short passes, but his long passes and through balls were not great. He gave away possession a lot, when tasked to make the harder passes. He got a couple of assists, but they were only because Villa could finish almost anything.
Dribbling: 10/10
Again, credit where credit is due. He's very good on the ball. Effortless glides across the field, bamboozling defenders, tearing up opponents. Just like Giovinco, he was a joy to dribble with, and it was great to see the frustration of my opponents as he repeatedly dribbled past their defenses.
Defending: N/A
Once again -- he's a CAM. He's not supposed to defend.
Physical: 3/10
Wow, he was weak. He was weaker than Giovinco by a mile, most probably due to his low aggression. He honestly felt like he could have been blown over by the wind, that's how weak he was. The slightest touch, the smallest shove, the most minor contact, and he's down. He didn't win any 50-50 challenges, and that was very disappointing. All this was from the CAM position, where losing the ball was annoying, but not too frustrating. At ST, his failure to hold off opponents can be very costly, so keep that in mind.
Weak foot: 7/10
Another strange one. The weak foot was very, very inconsistent. At times, it felt like a four-star, and at others, it felt like a three-star. Most of the time, it was somewhere in between. Good enough for close finishes and easy passes, lacking when it came to the more challenging opportunities.
Skills: 9/10
Just like Giovinco, his dribbling was good enough for me to not miss the five-star skills. They would just have been an added bonus; four-stars are more than enough.
Summary
I didn't get along with this card. Something was off about him. His pace and dribbling were sensational, his shooting and passing were hit-and-miss, and his physicality was atrocious. He wasn't a great CAM, and when moved in game, he wasn't an effective striker. I wouldn't recommend this card -- he just didn't cut it for me. However, for his price, you should give him a go and see how he plays for you (plus, the dribbling is just too good to miss out on).
Rating: 6/10
Value for coins: 7/10"

We recently speculated on what could be on the horizon for The Journey in FIFA 18 and beyond, and whilst we threw in some “out there” ideas, it turns out we weren’t a million miles away with some of them, as we saw at a recent FIFA 18 playtest, which you can read about here, when we got to see some of what is in store for Alex Hunter in The Journey: Hunter Returns. 
Now, EA were pretty cagey about sharing details outside of the specific titbits they’d brought with them to share, presumably a combination of avoiding spoilers and it still being pretty early in the press cycle, but here’s what we know.
Customisation
One aspect we touched on that was missing was customisation and that’s been addressed for FIFA 18, including the ability to change Hunter’s hairstyle (including some more “out there” ones like Pogba’s Leopard number or Hunters name shaved into his head in a gaudy style), change his wardrobe, including shoes/boots, and even stick tattoos on him. 
Sadly, whilst it’s good that customisation has been added, we don’t know much more than that, as in whether it’s something you set up at the start and are stuck with, or if it’s something that you can change as you go along, possibly as part of some sort of status upgrade. The final unknown on the customisation front is whether your cosmetic changes by way of tattoos and hairstyles will stay with Hunter he moves into FUT when you complete The Journey, if indeed that still happens.
Bigger Cast
EA have promised a bigger cast for The Journey: Hunter Returns and as covered in our gameplay preview, they flew to Madrid to mo-capture Cristiano Ronaldo. As such he’s set to play a part, along with a number of other footballers and EA also used the phrase “celebrity” more than once in their presentation, leaving us to speculate that there may well be famous faces not known for their skills on a football pitch.
Multiplayer
Again light on details and currently only including local co-op in the build we saw, but EA confirmed that they were working to get more local multiplayer into The Journey to allow a friend to jump in and play as a single player on the other team as you progress. I don’t know about your friends, but I imagine mine would just use that to wind me up.
More Locations
As seen in the trailer, the transfer market will clearly feature heavily for Hunter and as such EA have promised a bigger “world of football” to play in. The Journey in FIFA 17 offered only one league to start in but in FIFA 18 more locations will be available as EA have been on tour, scanning more managers (including La Liga for certain, Zidane and Simeone look great) which in turn opens up more locations across the globe for us to explore as Alex Hunter.
Goals/Targets
The Journey will have a new system for checking of your progress as Alex Hunter, including some smaller stuff to work on. The mode will now be broken down into 6 individual chapters and each one will have its own targets to tick off as you work through the story. Examples given were things like take 10 shots on target across a short time frame, or win a pre season tour. We don’t yet know how these objectives will feed into Hunter’s statistical progress but we’re hoping EA expand on that in the future.
STORY
Whilst EA naturally want to keep the core focus of the story under wraps, they did promise that we’d see more in the way of personalised decisions and key choices that will lead to bigger story branches. They also confirmed that there would be new playable characters, so whilst Alex Hunter will still be front and centre, he won’t be the only person we play as.
Here’s a quick breakdown:

More customisation, including hairstyles, tattoos, and clothing
A bigger cast including more footballers, managers and celebrities
A bigger world of football to play in
6 chapters, each with it’s own individual set of goals to aim for
Personalised decisions and more branching paths
New playable characters
Local Multiplayer

So as expected it’s a case of building on the foundation laid in FIFA 17 for The Journey: Hunter Returns with some important changes being made in the way of expanding the number of destinations we can take Alex Hunter to and increasing the number of twists and turns the story can take."

Following the initial FIFA reveal, confirmation that Legends rebranding to Icons meant that PS4 and PC could join the party, and the announcement that Ronaldo Nazário would be included, defining the term icon, we now know of four more.
Joining R9 in the icons line up will be Diego Maradona, Henry, Yashin, and Pelé.
There's been some speculation since the announcement of Icons around what would happen to the current FIFA 17 Legends roster, as in, would they all move across to Icons wholesale, but the announcement of Pelé suggests that perhaps that's not the case.
Regardless, we now know of five Icons in total and EA have promised that there are plenty more to be announced in the run up to FIFA 18."

One of the biggest names floating around transfer rumors this summer finally has a new home.
Striker Romelu Lukaku is indeed headed to Manchester United, in a massive move from Everton. United will reportedly pay £75m up-front with an additional add-on fees for Lukaku. Manchester United’s all-time leading scorer Wayne Rooney will return to Everton to likely finish his career where it all began.
It’s quite a move amidst all the moving parts and Chelsea’s reported interest, but Jose Mourinho has a new world class striker to replace Zlatan Ibrahimovic after United and the legendary striker parted ways last month. The Belgian striker should solve United’s goal scoring problem after the Red Devils scored the fewest goals among top-7 teams in the Premier League table last season.
So what does this mean for FIFA 18 and FUT?
Pogba and Lukaku’s Green Link Bromance
While Lukaku isn’t changing leagues in FIFA 18, his move to Manchester United gives him a green link with central midfielder Paul Pogba. The two are close friends and have been vacationing in Los Angeles, reportedly having a really good time.

Pogba and Lukaku’s strength up the middle of the pitch is downright terrifying for opposing squads, and their green link down the middle should provide plenty of great hybrid possibilities (I’m already picturing Ousmane Dembele out on the right side).
Perfect Fellaini Chemistry
There may not be a player in all of football more contentious than Marouane Fellaini. That being said, the Belgian midfielder's going to have perfect chemistry with Lukaku and adds even more physicality up the middle. 
While pairing Lukaku and Fellaini leaves a lot of pace to be desired, it’s something that we could see a lot of in FIFA 18. Lukaku’s base card in FUT 17 had 82 pace, and even after his unbelievable 2016/17 campaign, it’s hard to imagine that we’ll see a big bump in his pace in FUT 18.
One To Watch?
After debuting OTW items in FUT 17, it remains unknown whether or not the cards will return to the game in their current form in FUT 18. But, if EA Sports does intend to reintroduce OTW items again as we know and love them, Lukaku certainly fits the bill for one.
Along with Arsenal’s new striker Alexandre Lacazette, Lukaku would figure to be one of the most valuable OTW players in the game. His goal scoring prowess combined with a deeper and more talented roster around him should land him on plenty of EA TOTWs, just like he did last season for Everton."

It could be worse. A lot worse.
After a week ago saw zero dynamic player items receive boosts, FIFA 18 Ultimate Team's Team of the Week 34 sees a whopping five starters' Ones To Watch or Paths To Glory go up in rating as a result of their inclusion in the side. Amongst the notables, in the better late than never department, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's explosive end to the season sees his OTW up to 91 overall, while Douglas Costa also goes up another late peg, now at 86. Bertrand Traore gets a second bump as a FUT 18 OTW and now sits at 84 overall. 
Remember: Ones to Watch items will cease to be updated once their domestic seasons end. PTGs will continue getting bumps -- assuming those players are named to their national teams (sorry, Mauro Icardi).
And hey, while his PTG is still a left-mid, Futhead legend I Am French's favorite, ex-West Ham man, Dimitri Payet, gets a pretty interesting 87 CAM. Those that remember his monstrous center attacking items from games past might be curious to give this some run -- assuming you can make the French chemistry work.
Hard to call him a ""sleeper"", but after a nearly entire regular season with little in the left back department, Patrick van Aanholt, the man who relegated Stoke City, now joins a suddenly rich(er) huddle of viable LBs for Premier League squads and/or hybrids.
Enjoy it while it lasts; 'Team of the Weak' gets closer every day.

It is quite common to face an opponent who uses a team from the Premier League, but it is much less so to face someone who uses a team from the Championship. The obvious, simple answer to that thought is that players in the Championship are not as good as the ones in the Premier League. This conundrum results in many lower-tier players never being leveraged due to Chemistry issues, if not their ratings. 
However, due to end-of-the-season promotion, these unused once lower-league players may finally come to light as they climb the ladder to the more relevant leagues. And thus because of it, FIFA’s most popular game mode will be introduced to a few unnoticed stars that were rarely used before.
To help you become better acquainted with some of these clubs, here are 5 newly-promoted FUT cards -- one from each of Europe's top leagues -- that you should try out in FIFA 18.
DeAndre Yedlin (Newcastle United) – Premier League

Pace, pace, and more pace. With Newcastle United coming back to the Premier League, still under the management of Rafa Benitez, United States defender DeAndre Yedlin will grace England's top division again. This time, maybe even as a gold card. Yedlin had a terrific season with the Tyneside club and could be getting a ratings boost. A swap to gold may be wishful thinking, but a higher rated rare silver card will only increase his value. 
Adama Niane (ESTAC Troyes) – Ligue 1

In 33 Ligue 2 matches this season, Adama Niane scored an impressive 23 goals, earning himself a TOTS Community Most Consistent WIthout an Inform Bronze item. With the Mali striker being promoted to France's top division, it is a sure thing that Niane will receive a solid upgrade. The item won't be a gold, but he will defintely be someone to look out for in silver squads or career mode. 
Daniel Ginczek (VfB Stuttgart)  – Bundesliga

In the final match of the Bundesliga 2. season, German striker Daniel Ginczek scored one goal and assisted three more to help ensure Stuttgart automatic promotion to the Bundesliga, earning himself a TOTW36 Hero item. The striker possesses brute strength and a killer shot, characteristics that will make him a deseriable option upfront for most Bundesliga or German heavy teams.
Roger (Levante UD) – LaLiga Santander

Going from a 73-rated silver to a 76-rated gold, Levante UD striker Roger had himself impressive season in Spain's Segunda Division. The Spanish striker accumulated 23 goals in all competitions, which was enough to earn himself an 87 overall rated TOTS MC Gold item. Expect to see Roger in a few La Liga Starter squads next season. 
Giampaolo Pazzini (Hellas Verona) – Serie A

Italy may be the only country in the world where the older you get, the better you are. This phrase speaks wonders for Hellas Verona's Giampaolo Pazzini. The 32-year-old Italian slotted 23 goals for his Serie B side during the 2016/17 season, making him the top scorer in the league and earning himself a TOTS MC Gold item.

                        Colombian flair's heading to the Bundesliga.
                    

After spending the last few seasons primarily on Real Madrid’s bench, 2014 World Cup Golden Boot recipient James Rodríguez is on his way to Allianz Arena. 
Midfielder James Rodríguez has joined Bayern Munich in a shocking loan deal that will see the Colombian stay with the Bundesliga club for two years. Reports suggest that Bayern will pay €10 million for James’ services and have the option to make the move permanent for €35.2 million. Rodríguez was heavily linked with a move to Manchester United but due to the Red Devils’ recent signing of Romelu Lukaku, much talk of the Colombian midfielder moving to Manchester ceased. 
This signing sees former Real Madrid and current Bayern Munich boss Carlo Ancelotti reunite with his 2014 post-World Cup signing. In an official press release by the club, FC Bayern Munich AG chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge stated Ancelotti’s intention to bring in Rodríguez. “We’re delighted we’ve been able to complete this transfer. Signing James Rodríguez was our coach Carlo Ancelotti’s biggest wish, following their successful spell working together in Madrid,” expressed Rummenigge. 
Following the finalization of Rodríguez’s move to Munich, Brazilian winger Douglas Costa is reported to be on his way to Juventus in a similar deal. Reports suggest that Costa will join the Italian side on loan for a fee of €6 million with an option to make the move permanent for €40 million. Costa’s move provides Rodríguez with more opportunities for playing time.
The Brazilian’s move to Serie A (aka 'Calcio A') will surely make a splash in FUT, but how will Rodríguez’s move to Bayern impact FUT 18?
Helping the lack of high rated BuLi CAMs
With Julian Draxler having previously moved to Paris Saint-Germain last winter and Hakan Calhanoglu transferring to AC Milan this summer, the Bundesliga is now lacking a high rated CAM. Apart from Shinji Kagawa and perhaps Mario Götze (though a downgrade seems likely given his time missed), there are few quality options for the number 10 role. 
Other notable Bundesliga CAMs include Yunus Malli, Max Meyer, and potentially Emil Forsberg, but they likely won’t replace the brilliance of Draxler and Calhanoglu. Yunus Malli had a decent season after transferring to VfL Wolfsburg midseason but not good enough to warrant a high rating boost. Meyer, 21, improved but Schalke's subpar season doesn’t suggest a rating boost. The only saving grace in the CAM position is RB Leipzig’s,  Forsberg. However, the Swedish midfielder played a bulk of 16/17 season more on the left side (Forsberg could be struck by the LM/LW curse next game). 
All in all, Rodríguez should be the best CAM option in the Bundesliga next season, but who can he link with?
Few strong links but new hybrids
The biggest issue regarding FUT 18 with James Rodríguez is that he will create only one strong link outside of Bayern Munich (with 1. FC Köln striker Jhon Córdoba). Colombians rarely grace the Bundesliga which means Rodríguez will no support from his fellow countrymen. Nevertheless, we can now link Rodríguez with the likes of Thomas Müller, Arturo Vidal, Robert Lewandowski and many more Bayern greats. 
Something worth noting is that with Rodríguez’s arrival, a whole new world of hybrids can come to light. Hybrids including Juan Cuadrado, Carlos Bacca, and Radamel Falcao can all come to fruition. These links allow for new Bundesliga/Serie A and Bundesliga/Ligue 1 hybrids to exist. 
More Ones to Watch hype
It is unclear what the future has in store for Ones to Watch. There has been no news to suggest that the FUT 17 addition will return to FUT 18. But, if EA musters up a return for OTW, James Rodríguez will certainly get a card. Along side Arsenal’s Lacazette and Manchester United’s Romelu Lukaku, Rodríguez would be one of the top OTW players in FUT 18."

Just a little bit less ""Team of the Weak"" this week, FIFA 17 Ultimate Team's TOTW 43 showcases a couple bigger names more familiar to North American audiences.
One time MLS MVP Sebastian Giovinco returns to the land of IFs as does former US Men's National Team staple Clint Dempsey. Deuce had himself a match last week, and accordingly, he gets another black-and-gold inform. New MLS side Atlanta United FC's Josef Martínez also features after a great showing; his third inform of FUT 17.
The rest of TOTW? Well ... It is still the off-seasons of the largest domestic leagues in the world.
If you're looking for a specific K-League inform or you're a big Colombian football fan, you do you. TOTW will likely largely continue being your bag for another three or four more weeks. Until of course the bigger names return to claim their seats at the table.

In the middle of a frustrating period for some users during which a subset of the FIFA Mobile player base were waiting to regain access to their team, some startling news took the community by storm: Prime Pele was coming to FM.
At 99-overall rated, Prime Pele was set to become the highest rated base item to date. While taking him that last hurdle to his max-training rating of 100 overall isn't an easy hurdle -- it costs 1,472,629 XP and 1,540,842 coins to boot on top of that -- it probably wouldn't particularly phase those lucky enough to pack the iconic football standard-bearer.
So what's the catch? Prime Pele is only available in the covetous ""Program Player Packs"". It's no surprise to have a limited time only FIFA Points exclusive promotion like the packs offer, but as these are only available once every fortnight or so, it would mean a short window on top of the already high degree of difficulty in actually pulling one.
I was lucky enough to get my hands on the 99 God of the game. And while there's plenty of good, ""O Rei"", Portuguese for ""The King"", doesn't come without a few areas worth thinking critically about as well.
In-Game Stats
Pele is a complete monster. If you're unfamiliar with Futhead's ""Attacking Rating"" -- a proprietary algorithm unique to FIFA Mobile based on input from FM producers, power users, and some of the experts from Season 1 & Season 2 of the game as to the most important statistics for attacking players -- whether you're looking at base items, Max Training (100 OVR), or Max Training + Max Boosts (120) overall, Pele is truly in a class almost by himself.
For our purposes, since I primarily used him a decent amount out of position -- which I'll explain momentarily -- we'll look at his pure base stats. And they're still rather daunting:"

FIFA Mobile's Player of the Month program was an addictive way to turn Wednesday mornings/Tuesday nights into mad dashes to build the latest Master Player of the Week and try and make a bit of profit in the process. While this has stopped for the summer, there is a somewhat similar event taking its place. But before the original plans end completely, EA have released some limited time only packs enabling those that missed out to chase them, what better time to discuss the wonder that is POTM Arjen Robben In my Futhead debut, let's explore whether or not this right midfielder is worth spending the FIFA points to try and get.
Here is the team used while making the review.
Pace: 9.5/10
Obviously, the main pacey player that the majority of people have is Attack Mode Griezmann. It is safe to say he massively exceeds the Frenchman in every way. His acceleration makes him great for playing VsA as it allows him to get started very quickly in attacks, while his sprint speed allows him to easily get past almost all defenders with relative ease. I would even rank him in the same pace category as TOTS Aubameyang, just due to how explosive he is, and his ease at getting past defenders.
Shooting: 10/10
His nickname applies just as well in game as it does in real life. I scored countless goals with him just by running down the wing, doing a roulette inside and then curling a shot to the back post. I don't consider myself an amazing player, but I was able to score 6+ in almost all games in which I used him - against opponents as high as 107 Overall, with a large majority of those goals coming from Robben's cuts inside and shots either going in, or being scored on a rebound.
Passing: 8/10
I'm not sure about you, but passing isn't something I do a lot in my attacks. When I was testing him out at first, I found that he is more than capable of putting in a cross - normally with pinpoint accuracy and his normal passing more consistent than the likes of Juan Mata, who I found fairly inconsistent in his pass weighting. 
His free kicks are incredible, with both his accuracy and power being second to none. While most other players I have used struggled to get the perfect combination of the two factors from further out, but Robben was able to score with great success from distances of 30 yards or more 
Dribbling: 9/10
With his 105 Dribbling, you would expect him to be excellent at the roulette. He certainly doesn't disappoint, with one of the fastest roulette I've used. On top of this, his ball control means that he is very difficult to get the ball off of, especially when doing a roulette,  as he keeps the ball so close to him. With his pace being so high, it means that he doesn't put the ball to far ahead of him. Finally, his reactions means that he is always a threat on rebounds from saves, making him even better. 
Physical: 7/10
Perhaps his only downside is that his strength is not the best. He sometimes struggles to push defenders away from him if they are able to prevent him sprinting. However, this can actually be beneficial as he wins a lot of free kicks, which he is more than capable of scoring. He is still able to hold his own against a large majority of excellent defenders. 
Value for Money: Obviously, his price depends on how successful you were in making each POTW plan, or your luck in opening packs 
For me, I consider the 3-4 million coins spent building him to be well worth it, especially in my team which is mainly Bundesliga. If you are close to completing him, I fully recommend going all in to get him, as another such 99-rated right midfielder may not come for a while."

In what can't come as that much of a surprise, late Sunday North America time/early Monday UK time, EA's FIFA social media account announced that Team of the Year will not be in October:
FUT 18 Team of the Year won't be in October, more news to come later.— EA SPORTS FIFA (@EASPORTSFIFA) October 23, 2017

Perhaps the biggest upset was the time/nature of the vague announcement.
A few posts (later revealed to be an employee's ""personal predictions"") on the German FIFA Ultimate Team Facebook page had some speculating early this week that with the World XI's ""The Best"" ceremony set for Monday, October 23, Team of the Year in FIFA Ultimate Team could follow.
Savvy/knowledgeable folks in the space, such as streamer/YouTuber Chu Boi, had gone on the record earlier in the week stating that from their inside experiences (and particularly from a business standpoint), a TOTY move to October just wouldn't make sense for EA.
Now the speculation can begin as to whether or not The Best's ""World XI"" will even make up EA's TOTY. Team of the Year is one of the most highly anticipated (and high grossing) FIFA events of the calendar. Historically it's been identical to the FIFPro World XI. With the ceremony now seemingly ""disconnected"" from the promotion, EA certainly have the liberty to go in their own direction. 
With three months in between the usual release time of January and Monday's ceremony, EA may finally have the carte blanche to build their own 11 (or 18 or 23 or sky's the limit, really.)"

Last week we went 2/4 with our predictions as EA continues to try to sneak a couple curveballs in their selections. Overall, the pack rewards for the Marquee Matchup SBCs have improved slightly; however, with the prospect of next week’s Team of the Season squad featuring the likes of a striker Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, you should be trying to horde as many packs as possible. The best way to do that is to stay ahead of the curve, so let’s dive into this week’s predictions.
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to be selected:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
 Manchester United vs Chelsea
Match Info: We start off our predictions with a heavy hitting English domestic cup final. These two sides have had some cracking ties over the past decade, and hopefully this match will not disappoint. At the moment, players for these sides are selling at a premium, so maybe wait until the next Lightning Round to stock up. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 79 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Marseille vs Atletico Madrid
Match Info: The Europa League final is already upon us. A tie of this caliber should not go unnoticed by EA, making this matchup a favorite this week. Plenty of non-rares to get in on from both sides, and hopefully the pack reward will be quite hefty.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Lazio vs Inter Milan
Match Info: The Serie A has a fixture in the current Marquee Matchup SBC, but the, other big European leagues lack high profile derbies this cycle. This gives us confidence another Italian fixture could be selected though a derby between Genoa vs Torino has an outside shot as well. That being said, there are plenty of non-rares to go around in the league. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Hammarby vs AIK 
Match Info:  For the past few weeks, we have been trying to show the Swedish top flight some love, and this week we are feeling even more confident. These teams are part of a rivalry and they are the top two sides in the league. Add in the bonus that they provide a bit of diversity for EA and it should be a perfect fit, right?

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 68 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
There’s never four clear locks for Marquee Matchups, and we would not be doing our due diligence as investors if we didn’t consider additional fixtures. With already plenty of writing above, we’re going to keep this section short this week, and just hit you with the essentials: 
Villareal vs Real Madrid
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Aves vs Sporting (Cup Final) 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Gamba Osaka vs Urawa Red Diamonds
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Club Brugge vs Gent
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
Missed out on last week’s deep sleepers, yet that is the nature of this section. This week we have a couple curveball candidates EA might try to squeeze in. Make sure to be picking up items for as close to discard price as possible for these picks. 
Lech Poznan vs Legia Warsaw and Limerick vs Cork
Recap
If you're new to Marquee Matchup investing take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team. 
With plenty of big games to choose from we would love to hear your picks below! Also, feel free to share your thoughts on any games we missed."

Market Overview
This week the Team of the Season is in full swing, especially after the release of the star studded PL squad. With Lightning Rounds and saved packs flooding the market with supply, as well as people blowing coins on packs, players’ prices are being pushed down. This effect has created the market “crash” we are seeing now. With some more heavy hitting TOTS squads on the way expect that trend to continue. 
Now, we swing over to the Ones to Watch sector, who predictably have taken a huge hit this week. There were a couple special item upgrades that have carried a few players, but going forward the utility of these items is waning. OTW items will not be upgraded after their respective domestic leagues end, so make sure to keep that in mind going forward. With no chance for upgrades they just become sleeker looking special items. 
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graphs above are concise overviews of all the keypoints from the data that I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:   Usually, in this section we’re looking for large differences between high/low figures on players who experienced weekly return declines. There are plenty items that meet that criteria this week; however, with the end near we’re going to focus on players to avoid. So, in this section the likes of Mohammed Salah, James Rodriguez and Kyle Walker are players to avoid. 
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take:  Huge volatility figures across the board, but that speaks to the severity of the TOTS market crash. As I said earlier, expect this to continue and some players with the biggest volatility to steer clear of are Romelu Lukaku,, Michy Batshuayi and  Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Looking at betas this week, it's interesting to note that there are not too many outliers, which in this instance means that their past trends should continue. With that in mind, make sure to  be weary of the prices of Morata, Alexandre Lacazette and Federico Bernardeschi.  

TOTW Shout
This past cycle saw only one inform, but also a couple pretty tidy Man of the Match items. Douglas Costa snuck into the Team of the Week with three assists, while Alexis Sanchez and Diego Costa nabbed a couple quality orange item upgrades. Keep in mind their prices should decline heavily after the initial hype wears off. 
In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner - Diego Costa (Atletico Madrid)
Last week it was Douglas Costa, and this week we’re keeping it in the family (not really) with Diego Costa. The Atletico front man is our biggest winner, not based on his weekly returns, but rather his sneaky Man of the Match appearance. 
This article has been all about how the end is near, and Diego Costa is the prime example of the type of players that hold the last bit of hype potential. Costa has a couple domestic season games left, but the real value will be in the players who still feature in European competitions. 
That only leaves a few options, but they hold their hype potential well. It is not recommend to invest super heavily in them; however, there will still be an opportunity to flip right before kick off.  

Big Loser - OTW Market
As the stats show, pretty much every item could be considered a biggest loser this past week. Since the dynamic aspect of these items is coming to an end at the close of May, make sure you are not paying a premium for any of these items. 
Honestly, the TOTS promotion will drop these items’ values tremendously, so when that happens we do like to find a silver lining. As prices drop it obviously means they’ll be cheaper, and when they hit their discard price it might be time to bounce if you have excess coins. At some point OTW items will be useful for SBCs again, so if you want to play the long game the next couple of weeks could be the best time to buy. 
Recap & outlook
The end is definitely near for OTW items, and the FUT market crash is driving their prices down. Team of the Season squads will continue to be launched for the next month, so May is a time for you to stay on top of your trade game. Make sure to be buying low during lightning rounds, and selling those investments overnight on off days. 
OTWs might not be relevant for a while after the next couple of weeks, so make sure you are not investing heavily here. Stay smart with your coins going forward, because we all know we’re blowing them on the World Cup mode.

Following on from the Canada Day and Fourth of July events, FIFA Mobile now turns to France and Bastille Day for its latest event.
With French players having a greater presence in some of Europe's top leagues, there are a greater number of players who may be useful for your teams, with the likes of Dimitri Payet, Ousmane Dembélé, Paul Pogba and Kévin Gameiro helping spread the French appreciation across a variety of leagues.
As with the previously mentioned Canada Day and Fourth of July events, there will be packs which you can buy to help you on the way to getting one of these players. Rather than only being able to get the tokens from packs, you are given one with each Versus Attack Mode match that you win. Each win guarantees you a '14 Juillet' token, with a chance of a 'Fete Nationale' token instead. Converting five '14 Juillet' tokens will also give you a 'Fete Nationale' token, with five of these needed to redeem one of the 84-97 rated Bastille Day players. If you are only interested in certain players, all of the players are tradeable, meaning you will be able to buy as many as you want from the market to help improve your team.
The boosts they provide are split, with their ball control boost being just to their fellow French players, and their awareness being to all players, making them useful for a lot of teams, along with helping with that ever so popular Attack Mode Antoine Griezmann
You can view the requirements for all of the plans here, along with all of the player featured in packs this time:
97 GK Hugo Lloris
96 RM Ousmane Dembélé
96 CM Paul Pogba
95 LW Dimitri Payet

This year's reveal of the Premier League TOTS was a little different than usual with EA using the community to hunt down the squad members via #TOTSWatch in real life. (Going out doors, i know!) But after the buzz of that event it's time we looked back at our own prediction to see how we did. 
We missed eight players overall which isn't bad all things considered. Let us know who you think didn't  deserve their TOTS place this year in the comments below.

Fernandinho – CDM – Man City
With Manchester City regularly deploying both Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva in central midfield this season, the man tasked almost solely with protecting the defence has been Fernandinho. With the amount of possession City keep it isn’t the most onerous of jobs, but Fernandinho has done it admirably. And with over 90% pass success in all competitions, he keeps City ticking as well. He’s also chipped in with 4 goals and 3 assists too, which for a defensive midfielder is more than decent. An all-action midfielder who even at 33 shows no signs of slowing down. 
Aaron's View: Half of the City side could have been selected for a TOTS and I simply had to narrow it down. With eight players already in my prediction I chose to ignore Fernandinho for other options. Ederson was the unlucky player to miss out from my eight, and he makes way for the Brazilian midfielder.
Jan Vertonghen – CB – Tottenham Hotspur
Whilst Spurs are set to go another season without a trophy, they’ve still enjoyed a good campaign and look set to secure Champions League football once again. Their defensive base as always has been built around the Belgian Jan Verthongen who’s spent most of the season without his partner in crime Toby Alderwireld. Averaging 5 clearances and two tackles per game, Vertonghen is undoubtedly one of the best in the league and has produced yet another solid (if perhaps unspectacular) campaign for Spurs.

Aaron's View: The one player I got a lot of hate for ignoring this year was Jan Vertonghen. The reason I left him out was to force in Monreal whom I didn’t think would be ignored. I was wrong.
Dele Alli – CAM – Tottenham Hotspur
Truth be told, it’s been a tough season for Dele Alli with mild controversy and questionable form found at regular intervals of the season. His starting England place is also far from secure as we head towards Russia and yet, he’s still made the TOTS. By most midfielder’s standards 9 league goals and 10 assists would mark a great return, but considering Dele picked up 18 goals and 7 assists last season, it paints a slightly dimmer picture. There’s certainly no doubting his ability and Russia could be the spotlight he needs to finish the season strongly. 
Aaron's View: The final spot for me came down to either Alli or Son. I selected Son who also made the TOTS, but alongside Eriksen (who was nailed on) I just couldn’t see all three Tottenham attacking midfielders making the cut.

Nemanja Matic – CDM – Man United
There was a fair amount of ridicule made at the start of the season when Nemanja Matic joined Manchester United from Chelsea for £40 million, but few are laughing now as he’s been one of the most consistent and reliable players all season for Jose Mourinho. Amongst a sea of inconsistent performers around him. It’s whether that consistency is enough for a TOTS that’s the real question? 
Aaron's View: Matic? The only one that seriously surprised me. I think because United came second they’ve have a few players forced in but surely if that was the case Pogba was knocking at the door as well?
Sadio Mane – LW – Liverpool 
With the blistering form of Mo Salah grabbing all the headlines, the excellent work of Sadio Mane has largely been over-looked season which is perhaps why he missed out in our prediction. 10 league goals, 7 assists and a whopping 9 Champions League goals represent an incredible return for Mane who at times has been deployed in roles across Liverpool’s front line. I like Mane a lot, and at 26 he’s got his best years ahead of him. 
Aaron's View: Another fair selection by EA but with Firmino and Salah already making my prediction I couldn’t justify the weakest of the three, which happened to be Mane.
Ashley Young – LB – Man United
The surprise package of this season has undoubtedly been Ashley Young who pre-Mourinho was resigned to leaving Old Trafford at the earliest opportunity. He has since however cemented his place at left back, and may even be off to the World Cup. I don’t think many people would’ve predicted that at the start of the season. 2 goals and 4 assists represent and “okay” return, but his inclusion is likely for his unexpected rise to prominance than anything else. 
Aaron's View: With Davies and Alonso seemingly nailed on to gain a TOTS spot I couldn’t see there being three LBs selected, and I therefore excluded Young. Even so, I feel that Valencia would have been the better United option anyway."

The first FIFA 18 Ultimate Team Team of the Season where the story might be more about the player(s) that aren't there than the ones that are.
Who are we kidding? You're going to run to the comments below and argue about why Real Madrid (and reigning Ballon d'Or holder) Cristiano Ronaldo is a 99 striker while Lionel Messi, the class of La Liga during the 2017/2018 campaign, is just a 98 ST.
For a second straight week, we get a particularly OP side -- though one may argue that this one is a little less charitable across the board than its Premier League predecessor.
Besides the two GOATs, 96 Antoine Griezmann and 97 Luis Suarez both look particualrly enticing -- though the latter's base Pace is a bit of a disappointment at just 89.
Curious that Atletico Madrid somehow managed to get two TOTS left backs, particularly given how few games Filipe Luis accumulated during the season.
That leaves the question: Other than the big guns, which of these bad boys would you like to pull from your guaranteed La Liga TOTS SBC packs on Sunday and Tuesday?
Here's the full FUT 18 La Liga Team of the Season:"

FIFA 18's first patch is here ... on PC.
As is often the case, the EA SPORTS team is soft-launching the first patch/title update for the latest title in the FIFA series on PC, where the player base is a bit more modest in scope. After they ensure there are no hitches, the update usually goes out on the next-gen consoles (PS4, Xbox One) in either a matter of days or a week or so at most. 
Given that the first FUT Champions Weekend League is upon us, this coming Friday, October 6, we can only wonder if the title update won't get pushed out a bit more expeditiously than usual.
There are a couple very welcome changes in this release (did somebody say the nets?), as well as plenty of polish for areas you probably didn't even notice weren't working as intended.
Courtesy of EA's forums, here are the complete first FIFA 18 patch release notes. The emphasis is ours:

It's been a long time, Futhead.
Today, I'm back with a review of the 85-rated James (pronounced ""Hamez""; wink) Milner.

This god amongst men received the first record-breaker item of FUT 18 for shattering the Champions League assists record. It's only fitting that this titan of the game received a significant boost on his special item -- he has seen a boost of 187 in-game stats, and 39 face item stats. All of his face item stats have been boosted by at least 5, with his passing receiving a massive +11 boost.
His stats in FUT 18 are a fair reflection of his status as the greatest utility player to have ever played the game, and one of the greatest men to ever have graced the field. Boasting stats like 91 shot power, 83 long shots, 87 vision, 96 crossing, 95 short passing, 91 long passing, 90 reactions, 92 composure, 85 slide tackling and 96 stamina, Milner is the only central midfielder your side will need.

I used Milnerinho at the heart of a full Liverpool side, for a handful of games in my first WL in months.

I used the Basic chemistry style on him, turning him into a jack of all trades who is also a master of every single one of them.

Stats
I used Milner for 10 games, and here are his stats.
Price: 115,000
Games: 10
Goals: 7
Assists: 7
Let's get into the review.
Ratings
Pace: 8/10
Man's not fast.
He may be the most interesting man alive, and have one of the most exciting Twitter accounts on the internet, but he's not fast. His pace is adequate, and he can keep up with the majority of midfielders and central defenders in the game, but he gets smoked by pacey strikers, wingers and fullbacks. Maybe using a hunter or shadow would fix this problem, but I highly doubt that it would make him a pace-demon.
Shooting: 9/10
They should call this man the British sniper, because his long shots were insane. Fantastic shot power, great accuracy, and he can do it with either foot. Couple this with the incredible runs he can make (seriously, this man could get in behind the Iron Curtain if he wanted to), and you have a player who is capable of bringing the heat when going forward. He wasn't the most clinical inside the box, but get on the edge of the area, and let James bang it home til kingdom come.
Passing: 10/10
Iniesta, Xavi, Scholes, Ozil -- those guys ain't got nothin' on this stud. He can pull off every pass in the game without blinking an eye. Short-range ping-pong passes, long-range pingers, perfectly threaded through balls, crosses with more curve than Kim Kardashian, and solid free kick stats -- he's got it all.
Jokes aside, this is amongst the finest playmakers I've used this year, and I've used TOTY Modric.
Dribbling: 7/10
I would have loved nothing better than to tell you that Messi has got nothing on Milner's dribbling, or that when this English hero dribbles it is simultaneously mesmerizing, moving, spiritual and arousing. I wish I could tell you that as he gallops across the grass, you can't tell where he ends and the ball begins, and that there is no scientific evidence that the ball isn't actually glued to his feet. I really wanted to weave you a parable of a dribbler supreme who bends the laws of physics and football through jaw-dropping acts of ball-control and flair, whose exploits make him the most desired man in the world.
In reality, his dribbling is meh.
He's solid on the ball -- the ball control and dribbling are very good, and he rarely puts a foot wrong. Where he suffers is in the agility and balance department. He's a tank on the field in so many regards -- his power, his presence, his thunderous strikes, but also, in his nimbleness and ability to turn. He's quite clunky on the ball, and it means that you're going to struggle to weave in and out of opponents. However, as a CM, it rarely affects how you use him, so I'm not going to dwell on it too much.
Defending: 9/10
Brutally effective. I was quite blown away by good he was at recovering the ball in all sorts of situations. You see, James Milner doesn't tackle like most other players -- he doesn't come charging in like a steam train, and bowl his opponents over before trudging away with the ball. Instead, he plays with a lazy elegance. He'll run alongside you, like a mate joining you for a jog, and then all of a sudden, he'll pick pocket you with all the grace and stealth of the Artful Dodger, and quitely depart with the ball. Don't get me wrong -- he can snap you like a twig if you resist, but James Milner is a gentleman's gentleman, and he'd prefer not to make a mess before he robs you blind. I found him to be incredibly effective in the middle of the park, both at breaking up the play and at stopping players from running through the center.
There's one con -- he's not the most aerially dominant, so you want to pair him with a taller man.
Physical: 10/10
Tenacious. That's the best way to describe how this man is on the field. He will hunt you down, and he will try to dispossess you. If he fails, he will try again. And again. And again. He will keep going until he has gotten the ball from you, and trust me, he will get the ball from you. I've never seen anything quite like it. He's got the aggression of a un-neutered pitbull, combined with the stamina of Haile Gebrselassie, and together, that is a frightful combination. He is relentless, and will keep coming at you like a Hurricane hitting a small American territory off the coast of Florida.
Summary
All-in-all, this is a very solid card. He's got everything you need -- good technical abilities, stunning physicality and a jawline that could cut glass. Ladies (and gentleman, if this is what you prefer), this is the definition of husband material -- he's reliable, he's hard-working, he's got some tricks up his sleeves, and he's got incredible stamina. He can do it all, and he can do it all well. Oh, and he looks real good in red and blue.
Overall Rating: 9/10

I have a love/hate relationship with Chris Smalling. I love his item, and he is the most capped player in my club, and the most capped player in the history of my FUT Clubs (I have 750+ games with his non-inform item). But I also hate him, because when I see him in my opponent's squad, I know it's going to be tough to score.
On Tuesday evening, EA released the FUTTIES Winner Smalling SBC, and much to our collective delight/dismay, it is pretty cheap. For somewhere between 50-80K, you can pick up an 87-rated ""Mike"" Smalling. 

In-game stats
Not only does the item design look incredible, his stats are now that of a truly elite CB. He now has 80 pace (78 acceleration, 80 sprint speed), 89 defending (with 87+ in every defending stat) and 89 physical (with 93 strength and 89 aggression).

With just these base stats, he's an 86-rated CB. Stick an 'Anchor 'on him, and he's 92-rated. Those item stats look incredible.

Squad
I'm using Smalling in my main squad -- that partnership of Maldini and ""Smalldini"" -- has served me well for 500+ games, and it will be the partnership I use for the rest of FIFA 17.

The squad looks like this in game.

I've used Smalling for six games, and so this review is based on that. In those games, he didn't get any goals or assists, but I kept six clean sheets.
Review
I'll keep this fairly brief -- this is the one of the best CBs in the game. His NIF item was already one of the best CBs in the game, and this one is a significant improvement on him. He feels faster, with way better defensive and physical stats. 
Is this an improvement on his 84? Yes. Is the upgrade worth it? Yes. He definitely feels faster in game, and the 1% of attackers that could outrun his 84 item will be stopped by this one. His defending is perfect. Tackling is definitely improved, interceptions are better, and marking seems to be as good as ever. His physicality was one of the main stats that made the 84 item incredible, and it's even better here. In the games I used him, he dominated TOTS Lukaku in one-on-one challenges, he outjumped Koulibaly, and he pushed TOTKS Ibrahimovic around all game long. I didn't feel any difference from his 84 item in terms of dribbling, passing and shooting. He's still a little clunky on the ball, and a little inconsistent with his passing, but his job is to stop attackers -- I suggest pairing him with a ball-playing CB.
What really impressed me is that he was on par with Maldini in-game. I firmly believe Maldini is the best CB in the game -- I've used them all (TOTY Ramos, TOTS Chiellini, TOTS Koulibaly, TOTS David Luiz, and many more) and he's been the best. This Smalling item is up there with him. His pace, defending stats, incredible physicality, height, work rates, and the fact that his base item was already ridiculous, all make this item one of a kind, and one that you must get for you club. He's going to dominate your opponents, as you'll see countless times in the coming Weekend League.
Summary
Get this item. For his price, you won't get a better CB. He's one of the best CBs in the game, he's easy to link up, and the item design is incredible. What more do you need?

Regardless of how much you're still into the most recent FIFA release, we can all rally around our blue-haired Argentinian friend, Martín Mantovani, getting his first in-form this FIFA.
Bayern's brace super sub Robert Lewandowski gets a darn near TOTS level item for his showing against Werder Bremen. And a couple notable Premier League summer transfers, Chelsea's Alvaro Morata and Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, go in-form on their new clubs for their weekends in England. Not too shabby.
Just think: If nothing else, we're one week closer to the first Team of the Week in FIFA 18.

This past week, EA went a little cup heavy in Marquee Matchups. But with domestic seasons winding down we should expect a lot more of that.  We had a solid prediciton record last week, but going forward we know perfection is the ultimate goal, yet this Marquee Matchup cycle is jam packed with fixtures to consider. EA will have to choose from a plethora of matches from European cup ties to domestic cup finals, so without further ado let's dive into the predictions.

European Options
Although EA could not include any European fixtures in the current Marquee Matchups, this next cycle presents a prime opportunity for the return of Champions and Europa League matches. Coincidentally, the two semis offer the perfect four matches for EA to select, so make sure to pick up at least a few non-rare golds from each. 
Real Madrid vs Bayern Munich
Liverpool vs Roma
Arsenal vs Atletico Madrid
Marseille vs RB Salzburg
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to be selected:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Galatasaray vs Besiktas
Match Info: Another first this late in this FIFA, but we kick off the main matchups with a tie from the Turkish Super Liga. Two historic rivals, this matchup is intensified by the fact that only one point separates the top two sides. Definitely one to watch in real life, and look to the non-rares for the best risk to reward payoff. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Southampton vs Bournemouth 
Match Info:  This week we opted for an unconventional English match to represent the Premier League. It is a derby, but these two teams have not received much hype recently. As usual, go ahead and pick up some non-rare golds which should hold their value
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Real Sociedad vs Athletic Bilbao
Match Info: Shifting to Spain, the top flight matchweek is highlighted by the Basque derby. Two teams with a long history together, this is a solid derby to bet on even though it has previously featured. Pick up non-rare golds and selling into the hype could yield a nice profit.   

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Goteborg vs Hacken
Match Info: Rounding off our main matches is an interesting derby from Sweden. This pick evens out the diversity EA try to achieve, and would be right in line with some of the curveballs they’ve thrown recently. Look to the highest rated cards you can find from either side, and do not be afraid to sell into the hype here.  

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 70 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
There’s never four clear locks for Marquee Matchups, and we would not be doing our due diligence as investors if we didn’t consider additional fixtures. With already plenty of writing above, we’re going to keep this section short this week, and just hit you with the essentials: 
Juventus vs Inter Milan
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Ajax vs AZ Alkmaar 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Djurgarden vs Hammarby
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 68 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Celtic vs Rangers
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
Deep sleepers have been going through a rut lately, so we are going to double down with this week's predictions. The European fixtures look most likely, but we’re taking this week's picks to some neglected leagues.  

Tigres vs Monterrey or Panathinaikos vs PAOKi
Recap
If you're new to Marquee Matchup investing take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team.

You may have missed it Thursday, but EA SPORTS unveiled a recently updated version of their knowledge base article on bannable offenses for FIFA, getting the documentation ready for FIFA 18.
Things haven't exactly changed a ton, but some account usage gray areas were clarified (or more specifically spoken to) a bit more directly than in the past.
Amongst the highlights of EA's requirements in-game and through the companion apps:
MAKE SURE NOT TO DISTRIBUTE COINS
There's three things to be mindful of on this front:
-- Don't give coins to a friend. To paraphrase EA, ""this means you transfer an amount of coins for a player item that’s way higher than the average coin price of the item"". If you think you're being clever, you're probably not.
-- Don't transfer coins from one account to another. This one comes up time and time on again on social media every year. You can't grind games or rely on pack luck on an ancillary account to fund a primary one. This is one of the easiest offenses for EA to detect on their end.
--Don't do or participate in coin giveaways. If someone online is advertising giving away coins, they're either naive, it's a scam, or both. Both parties could be banned as a result of it. 10,000 coins or whatever they're professing to give away aren't worth the risks involved.
MAKE SURE NOT TO BUY COINS
This one's more obvious. Coin selling has been frowned upon forever and ardulously enforced the last couple FIFAs. Just because you got away with buying a few thousand coins or whatever back in FIFA 16 without getting a strike to your account doesn't mean you will now. There's cautionary tales on every corner and the inconvenience of losing all your player items and having to use a secondary account just to play FUT isn't worth it.
Mule accounts, comfort trades, etc are all strictly forboden. If you pay money to anyone to obtain coins, you're putting your account at risk. Any coin seller asking for your username and password is also able to quick sell or sell your items for less than their worth. Whatever backwards logic you're using to convince yourself this is in your best interests, you're better off not.
MAKE SURE NOT TO USE AUTO-BUYERS
If you see another FIFA blog or site convincing you easy coins are just a few clicks away, you're on a fast track to account reset or ban. There are no short cuts. It takes time, effort, hustle and/or money to build your FUT account up. Misleading fast tracks may be temporarily rewarding, but once you lose all those coins you paid for or the ability to pay FIFA on your account forever, you'll be kicking yourself over your own naiveté.
MAKE SURE NOT TO PROMOTE COIN BUYING AND SELLING
This one is directed more at YouTubers, but now that traders are making a name for themselves as well, if they partner up with the wrong folks, they're exposing themselves to the same potential bans as anyone actually doing the coin selling or buying. Whatever marginal extra disposable income coin sellers are offering you, it's not worth both poisoning game health and risking being on EA's black list forever. Influencers and content creators have never had more opportunites to be on EA's good side than now. Jeopardizing your chances at that for a couple extra bucks is short sighted, to say the least.
MAKE SURE NOT TO FARM COINS
This one is clearly aimed at coin sellers. If you don't have any idea how they farm coins, good.
MAKE SURE NOT TO MAKE FALSE CLAIMS TO EA SUPPORT
If you contact EA support and profess falsely to have lost an item or coins, you risk being banned for falsifying a report and wasting their time. Don't be that guy or girl.
MAKE SURE NOT TO 'HACK' OTHER PLAYERS' ACCOUNTS
If you login to someone else's account without their permission, you're putting yourself in EA's crosshairs as well.
MAKE SURE NOT TO CHEAT IN-GAME
CC: PC gamers. If you use any third party software to boost your players in-game or give you any kind of unfair advantage, you're deservedly going to lose your ability to play on that account.

Finally, in an effort to move away from the old two-strikes-and-your-out approach, EA have given themselves plenty of wiggle room as to what potential and possible punishments they can dole out. All of the following are now in play:

If you break the rules, we might:
Remove your account from FUT Champions leaderboards
Remove your FUT Champions rewards
Remove your FUT Coins
Delete your FUT Club
Temporarily or permanently lock your account out of the Transfer Market
Temporarily or permanently remove access to the Transfer Market on the Companion or Web app
Ban you from your current FIFA game
Ban you from all FIFA games
Ban you from all EA games
Suspend your console from playing FIFA online modes for a period of time

Market Overview
We can practically smell the Team of the Season promo just around the corner, and after EA made their TOTS Community announcements, the market responded accordingly. Honestly, the decline has only been fairly minimal, but expect the general FUT market to drop even further when the promo begins due to lightning rounds increasing supply. There is still time to sell off high valued players, but you might want to get on that sooner than later. 
In the Ones to Watch sector, these dynamic items are coming to an end of their usefulness as domestic season end in just over a month. Make sure to note these items will not be upgraded if they receive a TOTS item, but there is still some value as the promotion approaches. OTW players will still get hyped if they score, so we’re expecting prices to drop over the next week but look out for good risk to reward options that we will cover below.

Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats



The graphs above are concise overviews of all the keypoints from the data that I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:   At this point the best investment or flip potential items come in high hype potential individuals that are on a down turn. So, players like James Rodriguez, Nicolas Tagliafico and Ahmed Musa fit the bill here.

Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take:  A much tamer week of betas for the Summer items, while the Winter items sported super high betas. Going forward our recommendation for volatility is looking at high hype potential individuals who have lower volatility which points to them being discard. In that guise, Davinson Sanchez, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Nelson Semedo are sporting lower volatility than normal. 
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: The previous sections were about looking for players to buy to mitigate risk, but in this one well focus on avoiding high risk players. Players with high betas at the moment look to be more susceptible to the large clash looming on the horizon. Alexandre Lacazette, Romelu Lukaku and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang all look like strikers who will lose value when substitute TOTS items arise. 
TOTW Shout
Some big time TOTW shouts this past week with two items making the cut. Douglas Costa bagged a hat trick of assists, while fellow Brazilian Philippe Coutinho snuck in with a cheeky RM position change on his inform. Bertrand Traore’s Lyon side are putting in quality performance as of late, and although he  grabbed a goal and an assist he missed out on an inform upgrade.

In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner - Douglas Costa (Juventus)
Quite a few Team of the Week shouts that all sported incredibly high returns; however, one special Brazilian takes the cake this week. Douglas Costa is this week’s big winner, and he allows us to talk a little more in depth about the benefits of high hype potential players going forward. 
The ex-Bayern and Shaktar wideman has all the makings of a great FUT player, but with TOTS around the corner, make sure you are selling into the hype. Costa’s price will drop over the week, but he was a player who was a stable item before this performance. So, he embodied the type of item we are preaching to buy, the low cost, yet respectable player. 
Going forward if you are investing, choose players within similar positions as Costa and always sell into the hype, because profit is crucial with these items’ lives running down.

Big Loser - Michy Batshuayi (B. Dortmund)
It was difficult to choose amongst a variety of negative returns this week, but we turned to an unfortunate situation in the Bundesliga. The player in question is Michy Batshuayi who is this week’s biggest loser after suffering a season ending injury. 
The Belgian attacker provided some big thrills during his time in Germany, and we all wish him the best in his recovery. That being said, focusing on his outlook it is interesting to poner if he might sneak in a Team of the Season? It won’t affect his OTW price, but still an interesting possibility. 
Make sure to stay away from investing in Michy, but if you’re looking to pick him up there could be a few good flips when his price plummets during TOTS crashes. 
Recap & outlook
It is time for the general FUT market to start turning downwards, so get ready to buy low. The OTW sector had a nice variety of returns this week, which points to solid value still remaining if you can find the right targets. With high rated TOTS items coming soon make sure to stay away from the higher rated OTW players though. Profit is now a priority, and here are a couple final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Prices are angling down, so buy into the crash during lightning rounds and flip overnight.   

-- OTW investors: Honestly, not the most recommended practice at the moment, but if you’re so inclined go for the close to discard players in popular leagues.

Market Overview
Only a handful of days before Team of the Season is upon us. It is nearing that time of the year where every FUT player is looking forward to those beast blue items which make May arguably the best month of FIFA. In terms of the FUT market, players should be liquid considering the sheer amount of packs about to be opened will drive prices down considerably. Happens every year, and when prices are low during lightning rounds, it's a great time to buy. 
After that look at TOTS though, it's time to move to the Path to Glory sector where the majority of players are following the market down. Some big loses, yet there were still a few positive returns that present an interesting case to cover later. Also, with World Cup on the heels of TOTS, keep reading to see some investment tips that could set you up pretty nice. 
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats



The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  If you read my OTW article this past Friday you know that currently we’re looking to find players with high hype potential who are on a negative streak. This method insures you can get in low for a player, but with TOTS looming make sure you are flipping quick. Players in mind in this section are Raheem Sterling, Saul and Thomas Lemar.

Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take: Big volatility figures among both the Autumn and Spring PTG items this week. The large fluctuations in daily price speak to the uncertainty in the market, and the fact that most were pushing price downwards means stay away from investing at the moment. Some players who could yield a profit on quick flips are Thiago and Tiemoue Bakayoko, but make sure to stay patient on open bids.
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Just like volatility this metric is quite high among the PTG items, which further reinforces the uncertainty in the market. Looking at a couple players who have high betas and high hype potentials, the likes of Divock Origi, Alejandro Gomez and Bernardo Silva could see big price swings if they pick up a goal or two. 
TOTW & Upgrade Shout 
Our short break last week saw Olivier Giroud pick up a massive upgrade, but we’ll get into him soon. Focusing on this week's Team of the Week, we saw a couple PTG players put in TOTW performances in the likes of Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Giuliano who both scored a goal and grabbed assists. 
Also, noting the asterisk by Leroy Sane, the Man City winger won the Premier League Young Player of the Year, so people began investing in his PTG item which drove his price up.
Big Winner - Olivier Giroud (Chelsea)
We’re telling you low price, high hype potential players payout and Olivier Giroud just proved it. Over the week, the Frenchman who moved across London in the winter, saw a huge price jump after an inform leading to him being this week’s biggest winner. 

A crazy and perplexing  upgrade, the ex-Montpellier striker received an upgrade to 87 which vaulted him over his Puskas award item. This was unexpected and is the main contributor to the reason his price has stayed high after a week in the TOTW. 
So, Giroud is an interesting case of what happens when players who haven't been hyped get upgraded. The real money is in quick snipes after the TOTW announcement, but otherwise always sell when an item is extinct.The main reason is their price range correction leads to mass sell off, which actually drives prices lower than the previous max price range. Keep that in mind going forward.

Big Loser - Anthony Martial (Manchester United)
This week’s biggest loser was a choice amongst many, yet I wanted to focus on a caliber of player who becomes increasingly forgotten during TOTS due to better substitutes for lower prices. And, Anthony Martial represents just that.  

Martial was a beast early in FUT, and a terror when faced in Weekend League; however, Team of the Season items bring about player with better stats overall for very attainable prices. This means the likes of Martial will be forgotten, but they still hold hype potential. Keeping the previous point in mind, PTG players who get quality international minutes could be of value in June and July. 
PTG items do get upgraded during the global tournament, so a solid investment strategy could be to pick up certain PTG player during TOTS lightning rounds. Trading may not be as focal during the latter months of FUT, but honestly the decreased competition amongst buyers allows for a time where coins can easily be made if one just pays attention to trends.
Recap
Team of the Season has dominated the attention of FUT players this week, and everyone is pumped for the event to kick off. That being said, the hype has driven the market down steadily and expect that to continue as lightning rounds lead to a big crash. Path to Glory items felt the pain of the market decline for the most part, but a couple of TOTW shouts helped a few items see huge returns. Going forward, a quick investing technique could be to snag some high profile international PTG items during TOTS lightning rounds when their prices are low.

Xbox One users (especially those in North America) woke up to a new FIFA 18 patch on Tuesday. 
While some are probably still hoping for further tweaks to continue progressing the game -- and don't worry; we have a strong feeling the FUT product team will spackle and dry-wall more in this title by year's end than you've probably ever seen them do to get the game to its best possible state -- this update, which is XB1 specific, seems to target, well, a pretty particular glitch.
Yours truly experienced it during the very first week of Daily Knockout Tournaments/Weekend League qualifying -- and it's a wild one:
Uhhhh so, the AI is playing for me in a #FIFA18 Daily Knockout Tournament match and I have no control over the game pic.twitter.com/mRWeMDimM2— Luke Zimmermann (@lukezim) October 5, 2017

The patch notes above would seem to suggest this is one and the same, and to be honest, the workflow described is more or less how I achieved it. Essentially I'd been playing DKT streaming Xbox One through my PC on my LAN.  There was a bit too much WiFi involved (which, TMYK, you should really try to eliminate if you care about things like disconnects in FIFA), so I decided to switch back directly to console. But in doing so, somehow by having had my controller pared prior with my PC, the console assumed it was some kind of secondary configuration. Credit to whatever setting that AI was on -- it equalized at 1-1 before my trying to regain control at halftime caused the game to crash back to the dashboard.
PS4 and PC users feeling they've been neglected: don't. If there isn't a title update for those, the bug likely didn't impact those.
And everyone rushing to grab their pitch forks because of the latest group think social media meme about gameplay or your own personal frustration with not being able to get to a certain preconceived performance threshold, realistic or otherwise: hold your horses. As mentioned, title update four will probably be here before you know it. And if it doesn't offer what you're looking for, update five likely won't be far behind it."

One year on from the original announcement of FIFA Mobile at Gamescom 2016, we have a special promo in celebration of the event in 2017!
With the event being based in Köln, it focuses on the Bundesliga fixture this weekend between 1. FC Köln and Hamburger SV, with 5 players from each side being given a nice upgraded card.
The event runs from Thursday 24th August until Monday 28th, and during that time there will be a variety of things involved.
Firstly, some of you may have already gathered that you get tokens from winning Versus Attack Mode matches. These tokens can be used to convert into one of 9 different players, with 25 tokens needed to exchange for 1 random player. There is also a chance of getting a player as a reward from your VsA victories, so make sure you get grinding it this weekend!
Next a special match day event out on Friday 25th, where you will receive the 10th player - a 90 rates Jonas Hector - as a reward.
These 10 players can then be traded in to unlock the Program Master, which is a 97 Overall Jonas Hector.

There are also packs and bundles available to buy to help you speed up your progress, and allow you to get more players, or unlock the Master sooner.
They are: 
A 1000 FIFA Point pack containing 10 tokens, and a chance of a player
A 10k FP bundle which gives you 10 of the above pack, along with a guaranteed player in the topper. 
Each player offers boosts of +2 Short Passing to their fellow Bundesliga players, along with +1 Awareness to All! So no matter who you get, they will help boost your team in some way. 
On top of that, the Master Player Jonas Hector offers some amazing boosts of +5 Short Passing to the Bundesliga and +3 Awareness to All, making him one of the best LB’s in the game in terms of boosts and Overall.
With the likes of LvL Reward Master Robert Lewandowski, 99 Marco Reus, Global Tour Master Corentin Tolisso, Player of the Month Arjen Robben and End of an Era Xabi Alonso and Philipp Lahm just some of the wide variety of excellent Bundesliga players which many people may have, the boosts certainly won't go to waste. 

The players involved are:
1. FC KÖLN: 
87 LW Leonardo Bittencourt
88 CB Frederik Sørensen
89 CF Jhon Córdoba
90 LB Jonas Hector
93 GK Timo Horn

90 ST André Hahn
92 CB Kyriakos Papadopoulos
And, of course, the Master Player:
97 LB Jonas Hector

What are your thoughts on this event? Allowing everyone to get some good players just through grinding VsA seems to be a bit of a trend in recent events, so you can go for the master, or make a bit of profit by selling the players on the market. 
Let us know your thoughts in the comments!"

You'll be shocked to learn that Stoke City (and England national team) goalkeeper Jack Butland will get his pink-and-gold upgraded FUTTIES winner special item, courtesy of a new Squad Building Challenge available immediately:

Butland's non-inform item has long been heralded as the gold standard of FIFA 17, with only David De Gea and Manuel Neuer's various items often considered as definitively superior. Whether it's height, stats, or a combination there of, it's safe to say the new FUTTIES Butland will more than possess the ability to drive you to break a controller or two.
As far as this weekend's vote is concerned, the newest FUTTIES category, Favourite RM/RWs, is an intriguing one to say the least. What it lacks in star power, it likely makes up in potential closeness at the ballot box. Manchester City wunderkind (and former Ones to Watch item recipient) Leroy Sané is joined by PSG's pacey Lucas Moura, along with Bayer Leverkusen (and sometimes German national) right-sided attacker, Karim Bellarabi.
The Sané, Lucas, and Bellarabi SBCs will be available for completion until the winner is revealed on Tuesday, July 18 at 1 p.m. ET (6 p.m. BST)."

EA’s recent press tour for FIFA 18 saw them stop at Stamford Bridge, the home of the Premier League Champions, for their UK leg and we were in attendance, along with many other members of the UK gaming press. (although I don’t really put myself in that camp).
The setup was standard stuff for an EA press tour, a short presentation on the new features, or at least the ones they’re talking about at this stage, followed by the opportunity for plenty of hands on time with the game. There was a little bit on The Journey: Hunters Return, covered here, and outside of that it was offline Kick Off matches, either against the AI or whoever you happen to be sitting next to and that’s it. No Ultimate Team, no Career Mode, no Pro Clubs at this stage, just a decent look at the new gameplay features.
Being the sociable type, after a few games against actual human people I buried myself in a quiet corner and settled down against the AI for a few hours to maximise my time with the game. As with any early look at FIFA, or any game, there were bugs, there were elements that still needed work and there are things that may still change.
NEW STUFF
The key talking points that EA brought to the table centred on it being year 2 of their move to frostbite, making an effort to reference the dividends that would pay off with the new engine. Creative Director for FIFA 18 Matt Prior was keen to emphasise that a shift from one engine to another was tough, but that this had been a positive one, and in fairness to FIFA 17, the shift to frostbite was nearly seamless in comparison to past engine migrations.
The standout change for FIFA 18 for me was a new animation system that is typically tricky to explain in words, without the aid of test bed videos shown to us on the day that we can only hope EA choose to share in trailers. 
The crucial thing to take away from this change is that more points of animation, and more available animations, allow for more to happen, so an example given was from FIFA 17 where 2 players of differing height running alongside each other would still touch the ground with their feet at the same time, each stride in tandem, obviously wrong. The comparison from FIFA 18 showed Messi running alongside Pique with Messi’s feet touching the turf more often which seems obvious enough and simple enough but it’s a tech advancement that will bring some really positive changes. With animation cycles being shorter you’ll be able to “change your mind” quicker, because there’s now an animation to actually play out what you’re trying to achieve, whereas previously you’d make a decision, start an animation cycle and pretty much be stuck with it until there was an opportunity to break out of it.
That running example might seem like a small one, but it’s part of a bigger system that will hopefully allow us to see players able to deal with situations they weren’t able to previously, things I could reference positively were players taking the ball out of the air defensively in a much more natural way with high blocks and certainly more occurences of players intercepting balls running past them. Think of all the times your defender has stuck a leg out only to see the pass find its intended target anyway, I saw a lot more instances of players being able to intercept passes that would run past them in FIFA’s gone by. One last example I can think of seeing the new animations shine is with chips shots whilst running, I scored an absolutely beautiful little dink over an onrushing Oblak with a first time chip that I’d have never gotten away with before.
The new animations also allow for better trapping in tight areas, a new half tackle that somewhere between standing and sliding, sharper dribbling without the need for modifiers, it felt pretty nice to run at people with nippier players and EA noted that no touch dribbling had been tuned but to be honest, I still won’t use it.
Dribbling has been apparently overhauled, EA’s words not mine, and it is better, slow dribble is on RB and you should see more personality in dribbling, coming from the addition of 6 new “Player Archetypes” which they sadly didn’t go into much detail on, but as an example in a situation with Verrati trying to take the ball off of Hummels, Hummels feels a bit chunkier whilst Verrati is obviously a lot more nippy, again, seems obvious but it was good to see a noticable difference between different physicalities.
It’s been done to try and provide a distinction between certain types of players beyond just their stats and from what we saw it was pretty good, Marcus Rashford felt very “Marcus Rashford like”, and the system extends as far as unique running styles for different types of players, think Raheem Sterling’s arms, and in the case of Cristiano Ronaldo, they went as far as packing up all of their motion capture gear and chucking on a plane to Madrid so that they could capture him fully and replicate his unique movement and running style in game completely as seen in the reveal trailer.
Crossing has been reworked too with the pre-existing triple tap ground cross being moved onto RB + cross (or double tap cross, oddly) and a high cross being available via LB + cross which feels really loopy and probably best used in desperation when pushed right to the touchline. I was particularly fond of this change, as it not only makes different variations of crosses easier to instigate, but it also shows that EA were aware that crossing in FIFA 17 was a bit shite.
There’s also a new quick sub option that sits on RT when the ball goes out of play, so it’s only useable when the pitch resets for a corner or goal kick, that may change, but we couldn’t invoke it from throw ins in the build we played. Regardless, when it’s available because the ball goes out of play, you’ll now be able to hold RT to bring up the quick sub pop up and flick through up to 3 pre-selected “quick subs”. You’ll be able to set these up pre match in the team setup menus, pre-programming 3 quick subs that you can select from in game, or if you don’t set them up you’ll be given a single, pre-set option. You can turn these off, certainly in kick off matches, seeing as they have the ability to act like a replay for a little wind up opportunity, I timed them. Its 8 seconds before they time out.
Prior talked a lot in the presentation about “dramatic moments” and “wonder goals” and to facilitate those they’ve worked on through balls, player runs and volleys. We did find as we played and, more particularly, as we watched others play that longshots were ridiculous and utterly unstoppable. It’s not unknown for EA to “turn up” new features in the early stages and press tours to better show off some of the changes, but I would probably wager that 85% of the goals I scored and saw scored on the day were from outside the box, often well outside it. 
The improvements to through balls were pretty impressive, with runs being much more direct, particularly coming from wingers moving back inside behind full backs, from an attacking point of view they were a dream, but only time will tell if they become a problem defensively.
As you’d expect AI has been worked on, with a focus on team AI and players thinking together, or at the very least, considering the players around them more when making decisions. In FIFA 17 and back players made decisions regarding their positioning individually, not really considering where their team mates were and deciding where to place themselves based on that. Now they will take a lead from what’s going on around them. This plays into attacking too with players now using this hive mind AI system to make sure there’s always a passing option and will co-ordinate around you to offer space and support.
Elsewhere on the AI front EA talked about putting the changes to use in Career Mode to offer more variable team styles from your opponents, which is something they've struggled with in the past, so hopefully this will allow different teams to have different identities. There was also talk of humanising the AI, which basically seemed to revolve around locking them into decisions for longer, to make them feel more “human”.
GAMEPLAY
It can be challenging to separate how new features feel individually vs how they fit into the overall gameplay of FIFA but the new animation changes are certainly strong, slowing the game down ever so slightly, in a good way, however I would say that oddly player momentum seemed to have suffered, with players over running often. I made a point of noting that down so I’ll mention it, but in hindsight it’s possible I was sprinting too much.
The new animation system simply enabled more to happen, with players turning to take the ball in their path as it drops, rather than waiting to control it, then turn, and the ball moved a bit better too, looping from deflections in a more natural way and it had a more realistic pace on the deck, with EA noting in their presentation that they had tuned the grip of the pitch.
There was a definite positive to be taken from the runs and positioning too, with a safe passing option being available pretty much all the time and through balls feel a lot smarter and a lot more dangerous, but only when invoked from close range. Through balls from further out will still result in a foot race between defender and attacker, but from the edge of the box player runs behind defenders were a lot more threatening.
I still struggled with player switching although no one else on the day mentioned it. It’s something I have a big hang up with in regards to FIFA, so I was hoping for a positive change on that front, but even using RS instead of player switch, I found it missing my intended target often.
The dribbling improvements were really positive too, especially for me, as I’m someone that doesn’t make full use of dribbling modifiers it was nice to feel the difference between the different player types and how they handled.
A last word on gameplay, I was able to speak incredibly briefly with Samuel Rivera, who’s the gameplay lead on FIFA 18. Knowing I’d have a chance for a chat with him I wanted to focus on eSports, and more specifically how the success of FUT Champions had shaped changes to gameplay this year. Sadly I barely got more than a few minutes into our chat before the PR rep was tapping his watch, and we were moved along for the next interviewee, so the best I could get from Samuel was that they had been paying attention to these aspects in regards to gameplay and had also been engaging with pro players to seek their advice for areas of improvement, which can only be a positive thing.
COSMETIC TOUCHES
Moving on to the dressing and cosmetic touches, in addition to the obvious new celebrations and skill moves, which EA will no doubt talk more about in the run up to release there’s other smaller stuff like single players taking kick off instead of 2, a new lighting system which is very sexy indeed,  some of the lighting in stadiums as the sun is setting are genuinely incredible.
There’s been an upgrade to player models to just put more detail on their faces really if you should ever find yourself looking at them close up as you'll have seen in the reveal trailer, and the crowd looks less generic, so you’ll see less of the same types of character in the crowd close to one another.
The crowd move about now too, jumping up and rushing into the aisles when important goals are scored which means you can now draw them out when celebrating. Similar to the way running and celebrating into the camera on the touchline was recently added, you can now run over to certain sections of fans to get mobbed. I guess to add to that broadcast aesthetic EA are chasing you’ll also occasionally see close ups of the crowd a ’la Sky Sports and some of the pre match setup, like the players to watch screen has been updated to include that familiar “player turning and stepping towards the camera” bit that’s currently very popular. 
In addition to that, EA talked about prioritising regionalisation, noting that in previous FIFA’s pretty much every stadium felt the same in terms of crowd etc. but they’ve worked on that to include regionally focussed pitch ads, different lighting for different continents and smaller touches like paper or toilet roll on the pitch in certain parts of the world too, going as far as having things around the edges of the pitch in certain stadiums like inflatables and even cars which I didn’t know was a thing. So that all comes under a header of “energetic atmospheres” and it’s all pretty impressive, particularly the lighting, it looks really natural and whilst it obviously doesn’t add anything to the gameplay, the game is still better for it.
That’s all I saw in a meaningful enough way to be able to discuss but hopefully it’s provided you with an idea of the direction the game is headed in this year, and we’ve still heard nothing as yet regarding Career Mode, Pro Clubs, Ultimate Team or even EA’s plans to take their eSports offering to the next level but all in all, it was a positive event, the new animation system does open some doors so now it’s just a case of hoping that EA fully capitalise on the tech and use it to build a bloody lovely football game."

""FIFA 17 2.0."" ""It's just a roster patch every year.""
You know the message board talking points. Virtually all of them are perhaps trust in jest at most. But imagine a world where instead of a traditional physical release, the annual September FIFA release was instead an update through the PlayStation or Microsoft stores respectively?
That's what EA CEO Andrew Wilson spoke to Bloomberg TV about yesterday.
.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }


“The greatest disruptor to the consumption of entertainment media in the last five years has been the combination of streaming plus subscription,” Wilson said. “It’s changed the way we watch television. It’s changed the way we listen to music. It’s changed the way I read books.”
When asked about the prospects of a so-called ""'Netflix' of gaming"", Wilson stated “there’s a world where it gets easier and easier to move that code around -- where we may not have to do an annual release. We can really think about those games as a 365-day live service.”
Those sounding their internal panic alarms or rushing to make snide, defensive comments in response, think more to EA's existing streaming service, ""EA Access"". Imagine if instead of a 10 hour trial at launch and instead of $30/year you paid something like $30/month for the latest releases of all EA Sports titles year round.
We could theoretically already be there -- or at least in much closer proximity -- had ""FIFA World"" gained more traction and/or be slightly more fleshed out/full-bore and if we hadn't had the pushback on the proposed elimination of physical releases during the announcement of the most recent generation of consoles the industry experienced. Even with the eleventh hour pivot back to physical discs, we're seeing more and more titles be released earlier as digital pre-orders with the physical copies either lacking pre-orders altogether or coming out as much as four to eleven days later than their cloud-based counterparts.
The advantages to such a structure are plentiful: say if a game needed a dramatic tune up/fix, with the title constantly being iterated on instead of being worked on concurrently with a future version of the same title, it could theoretically be prioritized and rolled out more like a patch than having to be introduced as part of the following year's game. Or say a technological leap forward gives the game manufacturers new ammunition to provide a better and more vivid experience. A Frostbite type engine could be introduced mid-game traditional life cycle instead of 12 months later.
The challenges and roadblocks are numerous, however. As Wilson mentions, file size in our current high-speed Internet world -- the Xbox One X has been widely popularly received, but its up to 100 GB game and accompanying updates have some crying too much-too soon -- as well as design scale (Wilson talked about playing a game for a short period of a time on a mobile phone, then picking it up for an hour on a 60 inch TV before transitioning to monitoring it in your car while you're driving) make an abrupt pivot unlikely.
FIFA (and Madden) Mobile players have already first hand seen what it's like where the same app updates and all the sudden it's essentially a new game. The same restart you've grown accustomed to from FUT on console happened on FIFA Mobile just a few weeks ago, but along with it, a complete rewrite of the game's engine to support tuned up graphics and gameplay, a new leveling system, and a complete rewrite of the game's navigation/UI. All in the same app even.
What Wilson is proposing would essentially be a shift on console games to something more akin to that. Perhaps one of the biggest questions remaining is how licensing in a game like FIFA (and in particular a mode like Ultimate Team) would be impacted. Would we see a shift to more a ""FIFA Online 3"", Korea's popular years running PC game that has players from across multiple FIFA console releases within the same roughly FIFA 13 backed engine game? Or would we continue to see fresh starts/resets like we have since Ultimate Team launched on the physically backed console game releases?
The future is an exciting one. And while we're undoubtedly still years away, it's time to think of these sorts of sea changes as more and more inevitabilities and not merely hypothetical works in progress or proposals on meeting room white boards."

Each Autumn means a new edition of EA Sports' FIFA, and with it, newly introduced stadiums designed to recreate experiences at some of the more unique venues on the planet.
This year's game highlights four new officially licensed stadiums while losing a few others (au revoir, Borussia Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park and Valencia's Mestalla). Atletico Madrid's stunning new Wanda Metropolitano makes it debut. It's joined by the new home of the Los Angeles Chargers in NFL (and of course, LA Galaxy), the StubHub Center. Premier League newcomers Huddersfield and Brighton also see their Kirklees and Amex Stadiums respectively added as well.
With the new emphasis on ""immersive atmospheres"", these extra venues, whether you're talking Career Mode or FUT, should add to the overall picture of the game. It's always a shame when licensing battles cause stadiums to have to be removed, as is apparently the case this year, but it's awesome to have so many options none the less.

Squad Battles in FIFA 18 is all the rage.
With two weeks in the books on Xbox One and one on PlayStation 4, the only real question is how the first FUT Champions Weekend League will impact things.
In the meantime, one of the most recurring inquiries we get (and have had ourselves) is how many points you need to reach a desired level/rewards based outcome in the game mode. It's a near impossible quesiton to answer definitively since Squad Battles rewards are by very nature dynamic; they're percentile based, so the performance and number of participants impacts the final answer differently week in-week out.
That said, we finally have some data points to try and forecast what the future may hold.
In the video above, you can look at the results of the first full week of Xbox One and (as not noted in the video by the genius narrator/producer; cough me cough) an abbreviated one for most players on PlayStation 4. Other there showcasing video grabs of both of the first two weeks -- which admittedly has some utility -- it's basically a 9-minute ""Where's Waldo?"" of off the cuff voice over gaffes. Yup, there are refreshes on weekend days every eight hours for a total of 12 matches, not eight. And some of my ""who's higher or lower"" shows I truly have no short term memory and/or may be the guy from ""Memento"".
Happy Squad Battling."

Today, we'll be doing something a little different. It has been brought to my attention that I mostly review players who I enjoy or potentially would enjoy using -- trust the FIFA community to call out someone for focusing on the positives. So today, I'll be going through some players who you should stay away from.
Let's get into it.
1. Gianluigi Donnarumma
We start with the worst player I have used this year, and a contender for the worst player I have ever used, in any iteration of FUT. Unsurprisingly, it's a goalkeeper. Surprisingly, it's Gianluigi Donnarumma.

His item looks immense. Those double 88s, with the 6'5 height, and how good he was last year, made me think he would be the keeper for me.
How wrong I was.
This man couldn't catch a cold. He couldn't save a Word document. He was absolutely atrocious. The only thing he could do was pull off some decent saves from range, but that was only when the shot came close to his body. In most cases, he didn't dive, he didn't even react -- he just went to ground, and assumed the fetal position. There were also times when he didn't even bother to go to ground -- he just stood there, like a deer in headlights, completely frozen and completely useless.
He was beaten every single time at the near post. Most of the time, he'd just drop to the ground, completely missing the ball. At other times, he would actively move the other way. His inability to read his opponents was astounding -- it was on par with my great-aunt's current ability to read a book (she's dead), or Sheldon Cooper's ability to read a room. Throw in some awful decision making (he once tried to punch a ball that was behind him, and smashed it into the roof of the net), and genuinely awful distribution (must have averaged ~30% on his throws), and you have the FUT equivalent of Loris Karius in real life.
2. Piotr Zielinski
On the surface, the item looks great. Five-star weak foot, four-star skills, 80+ pace and dribbling, and well-rounded stats otherwise. He's also pretty tall, with decent workrates. He must perform in-game, right?

Wrong.
He did not feel like he had 80 pace, or 80 dribbling. The four-star skills are nice, but he was awful on the ball. the five-star weak foot would have been nice, if he had been able to shoot or pass more than 10 yards. His physicality was awful - he was tall and weak and off-balance, and he was dead by the 75th minute. His defending was only remedied by his pace, but the actual stats were awful. The phrase jack of all trades, master of none describes him perfect. Well, except for the jack of all trades part.
3. Niklas Sule

He's a man mountain, and it's not just because he's tall. It's because he turns like he has a thousand tonnes of rock strapped onto him. The least nimble, the most clunky defender I have had the displeasure of using this year.
In his defense, once he gets close to an opponent, he'll win the ball with a strong tackle. But if the opponent turns even slightly, he's going down like the Titanic. He's caught wrong-footed more times than I can count, he's too slow to catch up with any of the most used strikers, and he's god-awful on the ball - don't even think about dribbling with him. I get more worried when he's on the ball than when I see Ragnar Klavan defending in real life.
This is definitely one for Squad Buildling Challenges, but not one you should ever trust in your squad.
4. Radja Nainggolan
A controversial one, for sure, but one I should mention.

I used his loan item, and picked him up for a couple of games, and he didn't impress me. He's fast, strong, and decent at pretty much everything on the field, but he's not spectacular. And when you sink well over a 100K for a player item, you need spectacular. His shooting is good, but not fantastic. His passing is solid, but it won't unlock defenses. His dribbling is fine, but he's not going on any runs. His physicality is stunning at times, but at others, he gets bullied and is way to short to win the aerial duels. His defending and pace are amongst the best around, but defending really comes down to user error, and his pace is useful but not game-changing.
I'd say save your coins on this one. Not one you should necessarily avoid, but not one you need to build your team around."

As we reach the penultimate cTOTW of August, we have another second place finisher being honoured with a team in their name. DeChanz was unlucky to miss out on just first place by just 6000 fans to Daniel, but it was enough to earn a cTOTW.
As always, the winner out their own personal touch on the options, with DeChanz adding a variety of Romanian players to their team, along with a variety of elite players without a high rated card, to help give us some different options yet again.
For the second week in a row, a Dortmund player has been selected as the Master Player, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang finally getting a widely available card above 93 Overall. With boosts of +1 Sprint Speed and +1 Positioning, he certainly has the boosts to match his excellent stats, which will definitely offer a nice upgrade to any Bundesliga team.
On top of that, we have a well overdue upgrade to David Silva along with Aaron Ramsey and Samuel Umtiti receiving what will hopefully be a fairly cheap and high card.
Manchester City’s youth player Will Patching is the only bronze to receive a big upgrade, but it is all about the Romanians this week as they take 3 spots in the TOTW.
Remember that this month contains 5 cTOTW’s, so there will be another one which you will need to complete in order to obtain the Player of the Month at the end. 
The full list of players feature)d this week is:
84 GK Ciprian Tătăruşanu
81 LB Sakıb Aytaç
89 CB Samuel Umtiti
83 CB Vlad Chiricheş
90 LM Isco
81 CM Will Patching

Single player FIFA Mobile is kicking up a notch.
Gone are the days where your only hope is to grind towards a pack that may contain an unspectacular gold item at best. WIth the new in-game Campaign, what you've become accustomed to as Live Events are grouped in a way to chase a variety of bigger and better players and rewards.
On top of that, anyone who successfully completes the FIFA Mobile Season 1 ""Pre-Season"" plans for Eden Hazard, Paul Pogba, Serge Aurier, Javier Mascherano, and Daniele De Rossi will get added progress in Campaign when S2 gets underway later this Autumn.
Live Events aren't done and dusted either; in addition to their fancy new packaging and ability to be progressed through over time, almost all of your favorites will be back with a shiny new coat of paint: Team of the Week, Domination, Scouting, Team Heroes, and Daily Warm-Ups all return in Campaign in Season 2.
More ""Pre-Season"" players aid in this department, too. Knocking out the plans for Kaka, Leighton Baines, Thiago Alcantara, Robin Van Persie, and Radja Nainggolan in S1 will give you help in getting going with the events Campaign when Season 2 gets rolling.
There'll be more FIFA Mobile Season 2 news in the weeks ahead. And in a few short months, Season 2 itself will be here.
Stay tuned."

Ones To Watch are back and bigger and better than ever.
In addition to the six previously announced black items, 17 other players highlighting some of the biggest transfers and moves in world football get dynamic player items that'll upgrade any time those players get a new Team of the Week, Man of the Match, European Team of the Tournament, Hero or Record Breaker item.
Like last year, position changes won't impact the OTW cards. And should a player be transferred again, the OTW item will no longer be updated.
It appears that player injuries factored into the choices as one of the richest transfer evers, Ousmane Dembele's move from Borussia Dortmund to FC Barcelona, goes unacknowledged. Dembele suffered an injury early in his Barca career and is expected out the next several months.
There's not particularly any other super glaring ommissions considering that the players have to be 30 years age or younger to qualify. You're mostly arguing semantics ommitting one in favor of another for club/league diversity, really.

INTRO
Radja Nainggolan is a name that will forever be in the FUT history books, as the first player to get 90+ in all 6 of his console card stats, leading to him being known as ‘9Golan’ on console. With FIFA Mobile allowing stats to go above 100, Nainggolan still ranks as one of the best all-round players in the game with (check stats). In what is my final review of the Season 1 Pre-Season, we take a look at how the Belgian midfielder performs. 
With the Versus Attack Mode Master Kaka and an unrelated upgrade to the original Domination James Rodriguez, that you can obtain by winning 20 League vs League tournaments, also being released in the CAM position, Nainggolan is the only one that you can work towards using kits and XP which may make him even more desirable. 
Let's take a look at his stats: 

What is there to say really. 95+ in every single sta and 98+ in each ‘card stat’ makes him look like the best player in the game - ahead of the likes of Golden Egg Sean McAllister and both End of an Era Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard, and far ahead of the next best CAM, Player of the Month Heung Min Son. All that before we even see his boost of +1 Overall and +2 Dribbling to all, which may not be as good as some of the other Pre-Season players, but it's not something that you’d pass on.
However, with him being so good all round, you would be inclined to think that he doesn’t really have any stats which are incredibly stand-out, making him good, but not really the type of player who would be amazing to have in your team.
As you’ll find out in the rest of this review, your concerns would be misplaced. 
STATS
I decided to try out Nainggolan in the 4-2-3-1 Target Man and Wing Attack/Side Overload formation, mainly because I wanted to play him centrally, but also test out the 100 Overall Pre-Season LvL Master James Rodriguez who I had just unlocked. In one of my previous reviews, I was fairly critical of League vs League Master Luka Modrić, but he is still my third best CAM and seemed to have improved slightly from when I used him previously, which may simply be down to my team and him being a higher rating. 
As with all of my recent reviews, I played 25 games to get used to him and see how he performed. These were his stats after those games:
Goals: 54
Assists: 23
Averaging just over 3 goal contributions per VsA match against teams as high rated as 134 gives an insight into how good he is. Unlike Mkhitaryan, who I reviewed previously, Nainggolan was constantly involved in attacks, even when I wasn't using the Target Man variant of 4231.
To be honest, he could have had more goals and assists if I wasn't trying to use his amazing longshots to score much more impressive goals and instead tried for easier chances from nearer the goal.


REVIEW
As always, we start off by looking at his pace. This is probably his only real ‘negative’ of sorts, as he isn’t quite fast enough to properly outpace all of the top defenders in the game, but he isn’t a sloth either. His 102 acceleration meant he was able to quickly burst past opponents, but if the defender was fast enough, they were occasionally able to catch up with him.
His most enjoyable aspect is easily his shooting - his longshots in particular. From anywhere within 30 yards, he is more than capable of firing a long-range effort past any keeper. Not only are his longshots amazing, but his shooting from inside the box is also impeccable, with his shot power and curling shots both enabling him to score from anywhere in and around the box. I would even go as far as saying that he is as good as the likes of World Qualifiers Master Gareth Bale and Pre-Season Master Eden Hazard in terms of finishing, which, considering how good his other stats are, is quite an achievement. 
Obviously, as a midfielder, he did start from deeper positions in some attacks, but that made very little difference as his passing. He was capable of pulling off perfectly aimed and weighted passes at almost any distance without any real problems. His crossing was particularly good when he started out on the wing, helping create some easy goals from very difficult starting positions. This all comes as an additional bonus, due to how redundant passing often seems when playing the game, as it’s all about how quickly and how many you can score, not just outplaying your opponent in a single match.
At “just” 98, his dribbling stat is among the lowest of his attributes, but it is still more than enough to get by. His roulette is very neat and tidy, while his dribbling while running with the ball was incredible which resulted in him being almost untouchable when he was moving with the ball. I was able to weave in and out of defenders as if they were stationary training dummies and not players trying to tackle him, because he was so nimble and quick at moving and turning almost on the spot.
Lastly, his strength. Again, his stat is just 98 but he definitely feels like he has similar strength to the likes of Ultimate Team of the Season Kalidou Koulibaly or  Pre-Season William Carvalho, who boast 105+ strength as a base stat. When a defender was able to catch up to him, he was able to hold them at bay until he managed to get a shot or pass away, or was simply able to run much closer to the goal before being fouled.
SUMMARY
What. A. Player. 
I know it may now be difficult to get him with the market being shut, but if you have the chance to build 1 more player, make it Nainggolan. He is up there with the best players I have used this year. His all-round ability is simply outstanding and the only regret I have is that I waited so long to complete him! He may not have the highest total stats in the game, that honour still goes to Goldlen Egg Sean McAllister but he is by far the best all round player that I have used this year.
Being able to shoot past the likes of Pre-Season Versus Attack Mode Master Jan Oblak, Team of the Year Manuel Neuer and Ultimate Team of the Season Gianluigi Buffon with no difficulty made my grinding towards Pre-Season Versus Attack Mode Master Gonzalo Higuain somewhat bearable again after autoplaying to try and get wins while not having to pay too much attention to the game. Nainggolan brought a lot of fun back into the game for me, even with the remaining time on Season 1 being extremely low.
His combination of pace, shooting, strength and dribbling is almost perfect. Being able to roulette past defenders with ease and then fire a longshot into the top corner brings some of the early fun and enjoyment back into FIFA Mobile after it seemed to lose some of the buzz in recent times.
I know that I have previously raved about how good both Neymar and Fernando Torres are, but I honestly haven't found a player who is as fun to use as Nainggolan this year. The only slight fault I could find was that he could have been ever so slightly faster, which is the only thing that is stopping me from giving him a perfect 10/10 rating.

After last week’s excellent prediction, where I got 3/4 correct and said that the Moscow derby may end in a draw, we move on to the second week of “Matchups”. 
With this being an international break, the four matches come from the European World Cup playoff fixtures which take place this weekend, rather than some lower league domestic fixtures.
These games can be split into two sets:
1) Denmark v Republic of Ireland and Italy v Sweden -- Even though the Italy v Sweden game is a second leg, we won't know the result of the first leg until after the matchup prediction is live. This makes these two fixtures slightly more difficult to predict as we don't know who needs what and which players are in top form for these matches.
2) Greece v Croatia and Switzerland v Northern Ireland -- Two second leg ties, with the first leg being played on Thursday night. I'd recommend waiting until after both games have finished and then looking to see which team has the advantage before making your prediction.
With the Moscow Derby causing some problems with it being a draw and everyone ‘losing’ from the opportunity to get Jesus for free, we now have the option to pick a draw as the result which adds a little more interest to proceedings.
So, without further ado, let’s get into this week’s predictions.

DENMARK V REPUBLIC OF IRELAND
Denmark reaching the playoffs was almost singlehandedly down to their main man Christian Eriksen. The Spurs playmaker scored in 7 of the 8 games in which Denmark cored in the group stage, being directly involved in 60% of their goals. 
Ireland reached the playoffs thanks to a 1-0 win over Wales in the last matchday of the group stage, and qualified as the 8th best of the 2nd placed teams. With a draw away to Serbia and victories in Wales and Austria, the Irish (and their fans) are not to be brushed off lightly.
I can see this being a very close match, with Denmark sneaking a win due to home advantage, but a draw is certainly not off the table. 
My prediction: Denmark win
Game is played: Saturday 11th November 7:45 p.m. GMT / 2:45 p.m. EST

Switzerland v Northern Ireland
Switzerland were in an automatic qualification berth for the entire group stage until they were defeated by European champions Portugal in the final match. With 14 different goal scorers, they are capable of scoring from anyone in the team, even without too many big name players.
Northern Ireland shocked everyone in this qualifying campaign, qualifying with games to spare. Their team strength as a unit is not to be overlooked, and they pride themselves on a very tight defence.
Switzerland being at home, combined with key trickster Xherdan Shaqiri seeming to have found form at the right time makes be feel like a home win is going to be the final result.
My prediction: Switzerland win
Games is played: Sunday 12th November, 5:00 p.m. GMT / 12:00 p.m. EST

Greece V Croatia
Croatia would have secured their ticket to Russia if they hadn’t conceded a 90th minute equaliser in their last home game of the campaign against Finland. Instead, Iceland have reached their second tournament in a row, where their fans can impress on an international stage once again. 
Greece only tasted defeat once in the group stage -- a 2-1 loss at home to Belgium - and were the only team to take points off of the Red Devils. Since their shock EURO 2004 win, they haven’t been able to recreate that success, but they will be aiming to avoid their second tournament absence in a row. 
Greece’s record in qualifying shows that they certainly aren’t to be laughed at, but I can't see them making too big an upset against the sheer qualify that Croatia possess in their midfield and attack.
My prediction: Croatia win
Games is played: Sunday 7:45 p.m. GMT / 2:45 p.m. EST 

Italy v Sweden
Had this match come four or five years ago, it would have been a huge encounter. Ibrahimovic in his prime against the Azzurri’s rock solid Juventus backline. In two very different group stages, Italy performed as expected, only losing away to runaway group leaders Spain.
Swedish fans must have been dreading qualification, having been drawn with both France and the Netherlands. However, the decline of the Dutch came at the right time for Sweden, who showed no sign of being in a decline of their own without Ibra, and finished in second place, ahead of the Dutch on goal difference. 
With Italy’s defensive record in qualifying was excellent, and Sweden one of the top scorers, it looks set to be a very exciting tie, but I feel like the Italians will benefit from home advantage and get the win this time.
My prediction: Italy win
Game is played: Monday 13 November, 7:45 p.m. GMT / 2:45 p.m. EST 

That's who I think will win the four Matchups games this week. Who do you think will get the wins? Remember, that if you get all 4 games correct, you will win a special 83-overall RM Xherdan Shaqiri.
Good luck and happy predicting!"

This isn't a Team of the Week you'll remember particularly fondly. In fact, other than it being out during a presumed Premier League Team of the Season this coming weekend, you potentially won't remember it at all.
FIFA 18's TOTW 33 has a couple names in FUT circles: Alex Telles gets a third in-form and his last meaningful bump before his expected Liga NOS or Rest of the World TOTS, now up to 86 overall. Juventus' Juan Cuadrado, who yup, played right back for the Old Lady, gets an 86 overall in-form that while high on pace and dribbling is likely unplayable due to a 70 defense rating (though one could suppose you could start him at RB and switch him in-game).
No real sleepers this week as this particular side is rather sleepy in and of itself, but Idrissa Gueye as an 85 CDM might be a nice relative bargain beast given the volume of packs anticipated to be opened this weekend. Just think: soon, pretty much all the TOTWs will look and feel an awful lot like this one. Welp.
In all its glory, here's the FIFA Ultimate Team 18 Team of the Week 33:"

It's been a while, but I'm finally back!
Today, I'll be taking a look at the 92-rated Prime Icon Alessandro Del Piero.
This card is available through his Prime Icon SBC (untradeable) as well as in packs (tradeable). Last week, along with the main SBC, EA dropped a loan SBC, allowing you to pick him up for 20 games (this review is on the loan card -- I'm not locking in over a million coins on an untradeable card this early in FUT 18).

 Want to review players on Futhead? Do your own! 

In-Game Stats:

Key Stats: 94 positioning, 95 finishing, 91 long shots, 94 vision, 95 ball control, 95 dribbling, 93 composure.
I used Del Piero with a Hawk chemistry style, which gives him the following boosts.

Stats
I used Del Piero in a variety of squads, and he played in both the ST and CAM positions. Personally, I found him to be most effective in the ST position.
Here are my stats with Del Piero:
Games: 10
Goals: 15
Assists: 6
Review
Pace: 8/10
Not the fastest, and it definitely shows in game. That being said, he's by no means slow -- he's got good acceleration, allowing him to get away from defenders who are trying to contain him. However, don't expect him to tear through defenses with ease -- most CBs can keep up with him (especially if they have the anchor or shadow chemistry styles), and fullbacks don't have too much trouble stopping him.
Shooting: 10/10
Sublime. The five-star weak foot makes him one of the best shooters in the game, because he can do it with either foot from any angle. Inside the box, he's as clinical as it gets. Outside the box, anything within 30 yards is fair game, and from further out he will test the keeper. Try any kind of shot -- low driven, finesse, chip, power -- he'll score.
Passing: 10/10
Absolutely no issues. Inch-perfect short and long passing, and decent on the cross as well. I really liked the weak foot here, as it means that he can make a pass no matter which way he is facing, and he's impossible to read and stop.
Dribbling: 8/10
Loved the dribbling, with one small issue. His balance means he goes down instantly, even if he's only slightly off-balance. Besides that, his dribbling is perfect. Ball-control is awesome, dribbling is the best I've seen this year, and his agility and reactions are insane.
Defending: N/A
Physical: 5/10
Really lets down the card. He's very, very weak, and it really prevents him from dominating in this game. He can't hold his own against any competent defender, and it means that you have to either shoot or pass the moment you get the ball in front of goal. His aggression is pretty pathetic too, meaning he never puts up a fight. His stamina is the only positive here, but it can't undo the damage that has been done.
Summary
Did I like Del Piero? Yes. Will I be buying or building him? Absolutely not.
For his price, you can get so many players who are far more effective in-game. The combination of lower pace, poor balance, and a total absence of strength really hurt the card. Del Piero is a luxury player, and one that you should get only if you really liked him in real life, or if a player with this playstyle suits you (in my case, it doesn't).

With Team of the Season in full effect, the standard TOTW format becomes much more difficult to predict, as we've seen in the last two weeks. That said, our Aaron has done a fine job to only miss eight players from his prediction this week, but there are three in particular he is not happy (raging even) about. Find out why below. 
Idrissa Gueye – CDM – Everton
The football may not be sparkling, but no one can disagree with the job Big Sam has done at Everton in terms of points on the board. And they got three more on Saturday with a solid away performance at Huddersfield. Cenk Tosun opened the scoring just before half time, before TOTW entrant Idrissa Gueye wrapped up the win on 76 minutes. He also had 100% tackle success (6) and three interceptions to round-off an all-action display. 
Aarons View: I did look at Gueye, but with just the one goal to his name it was always going to be difficult to include him. With the Premier League TOTS on the way, we were always likely to see a few cheap IFs though.
Alex Telles – LB – Porto
With Benfica dropping points in a surprise loss to Tondela on Saturday, Porto had the chance to put one hand on the league title as they went to Maritimo. And by the skin of their teeth, they did exactly that with Moussa Marega netting the winner in the 88th minute sending Porto five clear at the top. Two red cards for Maritimo didn’t help their cause, but Alex Telles gets the TOTW nod for his assist for the goal, three tackles and four key passes from left back to seal his TIF. 
Aarons View: I struggled this week to keep my defender count down with so many picking up attacking contributions, so to see Telles make the cut with a single assist is a kick in the teeth, especially when it’s his third IF.
Matthijs De Ligt – CB – Ajax
With nothing to play for at the top of the Eredivisie, Ajax are doing their best to make the league table look a little more respectable by beating AZ Alkmaar 3-0. The goals came from Kluivert, Neres and Donny van de Beek whose goal was laid on by TOTW 33’s Matthjs De Ligt, who grabs his fourth IF of FUT 18. With just a single assist to his name enough for this IF, one starts to wonder if there will even be an Eredivisie TOTS this year… 
Aarons View: The same as Telles; I’m not sure how EA managed to fit in these defenders whilst leaving out so many other options. This one really does take the biscuit with De Ligt picking up a fourth IF for just one assist.
Nils Petersen – ST – Freiburg
Freiburg picked up a crucial win in the Bundesliga on Saturday as they look to avoid a relegation play-off scenario. They beat bottom club Cologne in a tight affair 3-2 in which Nils Petersen bagged the first two goals of the game. Leonardo Bittencourt fired two back for Cologne, before Lucas Holer scored the dramatic winner in extra time. Crucial win for Freiburg and a third IF for Petersen. 
Aarons View: With Messi missing out after yet another hat trick, it left a spot open, and Petersen is the lucky player to get the nod  increasing his IF in time for a likely TOTS boost.
Julian Cuesta – GK – Wisla Krakov
There’s still a few weekends of playoffs to go in the Polish League and Wisla Krakov secured an important 1-0 win against Jagiellonia on Saturday. The goal however was not the most important moment of the game as Wisla keeper Julian Cuesta performed heroics between the sticks saving a penalty and making four other saves to secure the win. With that performance behind him, he was always in with a chance this week. 
Aarons View: I seriously struggled for a second keeper this week and it looks as though EA did as well. Cuesta’s penalty save in a 1-0 win was enough for him but with him being a Silver I didn’t consider him as the usual trend is two golds.
Miguel Almiron – CAM – Atlanta United
Atlanta United continued their impressive start to the MLS season on Saturday where they soundly beat Montreal 4-1. The goals were divided equally between Kevin Kratz and Miguel Almiron who both grabbed a brace, but the IF goes to Almiron for his eight successful dribbles and two key passes on top of his goals. Decent looking card this as well. 
Aarons View: For me, this is the only player that I could have predicted this week from those missed. With so many options, I had to narrow it down and unfortunately it went the other way for Almiron. 
Marco Wolfli – GK – BSC Young Boys
When you secure the league title, IF’s are normally on the way and that’s exactly what BSC Young Boys did on the weekend with a 2-1 win against Luzern enough for the top prize in Switzerland. So why goalkeeper Marco Wolfli? Well he saved a penalty in this one but with no clean sheet its still a push to include him in my humble opinion. 
Aarons View: It looks as though Young Boys have been given an IF due to winning the title with Wolfli saving a penalty in a 2-1 win. The best part of it being that both Barcelona and Celtic who both had valid shouts at an IF from multiple players were snubbed under the same criteria. 
Eldor Shomurodov – ST – FC Rostov
FC Rostov are doing their level best to avoid a relegation play-off in the Russian Premier League with a 2-0 win against Tosno enough to move them three points clear of the sides below. And Eldor Shomurodov was the hero of the hour scoring both the goals in the final half hour of the match. Spartak Moscow away and Ural at home await Rostov in their final matches of the season.

Aarons View: Two goals were enough for the Rostov striker, but he gets the nod in front of several hat tricks. Personally, I don’t understand why as I was having to exclude players with three goals, let alone consider those without."

FIFA 17 is rapidly approaching the end of its natural life.
With the final FUT 17 Weekend League set for next weekend, even if last year's game is starting to feel like a bit of a drag, if you manage to play five different days of Ultimate Team over the next week, you'll start FIFA 18 with something for your time.
First announced in game back on August 18, taking a page out of Madden and some of EA's mobile properties, you can get a start towards FUT 18 by killing the time to get to launch by playing the previous offering. I know, I know; those lucky enough to play the beta or get their hands on the game at Gamescom may be at or near a point of no return. But if you can just will yourself to just play a single game of FUT five different days before next Monday, you can get your hands on a couple of the more interesting and popular kits from the past game. 

Depending on how many people actually complete the task, the kits may be a relative rarity in this Autumn's title.
Hopefully next year, the live content team will go a step forward and create SBCs to unlock special items to start next FIFA (as MUT does). For now, this is a pretty decent first time offering."

                        Two big names out of the blue.
                    

Aaron went two better this week missing just six of EA's TOTW 6 contingent in his Predictions. But, with the release of the Ultimate Scream Team earlier this week, there were always going to be some notable absentee's (Khedieria, Depay, etc).  All the same, there are still some huge names and IF's we missed, so find out why they made the TOTW below and  enjoy some rationale from Aaron about why he didn't pick a few of the players earlier in the week. 
If you have any other feedback, hit the comments! 
Hilton – CB – Montpellier
Montpellier made it back-to-back wins in Ligue 1 on Friday night with a plucky 1-0 win away at St Etienne. They came under the cosh for long period’s, however, after Mbenza’s opener and Brazillian centre back Hilton was at the heart of that resistance making 15 clearances, 6 tackles and winning all 6 of his aerial duels. He’s 40 years old. Forty. And he has two IF's already.

Aaron's View: Hilton didn't feature in L’equipes TOTW. 0 goals, 0 assists. One of those players that you are never really going to guess.
Iniesta – LM – Barcelona
Barcelona maintained their grip on La Liga top spot with a comfortable 2-0 win at home to Malaga on Saturday where Iniesta grabbed Barca’s second goal, following up Deulofeu’s 1st minute strike. As is routine these days Iniesta was also named in the FIFA TOTY earlier this week which will no doubt see him pick-up yet another blue in FIFA 18 when the time comes. How useful this IF will actually be as an LM is up for debate, but enjoy Iniesta while you still can folks. 
Aaron's View: Iniesta only managed a 2 star rating in Marca and wasn't MOTM either and only scored one goal in a routine 2-0 win for Barca. Can only presume he was included as a ""big name"" for this weeks TOTW.
Mahrez – RM – Leicester City
After a run of six winless Premier League matches, Leicester finally picked up three points against fellow strugglers Swansea last weekend. The win was inspired by a bright Riyad Mahrez who provided both the assists, but is that really enough for an In Form? It seems so, but given the bar set by Mahrez in previous seasons this one feels a little cheap. With Craig Shakespeare sacked, Leicester City are on the hunt for a new manager. 
Aaron's View: With hindsight this one was probably guessable with a Mahrez getting an assist alongside causing the OG. But I never really considered him against the other options this week.
Valencia – RM – Tigres UANL
Former West Ham and Everton loanee Enner Valencia packed his bags for Tigres in the summer and ever since his arrival in Mexico he’s been in great form scoring 8 goals in 10 games to propel his new side to third in the league. Two of those goals came in Tigres bad tempered 3-0 win against Toluca which saw two players sent off in the first half. With Valencia and Gignac up top, Tigres certainly have the firepower to have a great season. 
Aaron's View: With two goals and a lack of gold options, Valencia was an overlook on my behalf, but I opted for the bigger league silvers in Fullkrug and Costa due to lack of options in their retrospective leagues 
Mooy – CM - Huddersfield
Much to my personal disappointment, Huddersfield put in a terrific performance against Manchester United on Saturday in a blustery John Smith’s Stadium. Rashford’s late goal provided hope, but Huddersfield never really looked in great danger and that’s partly thanks to the work put in by Aaron Mooy who scored and pestered United all game long. One of Huddersfield’s standout signings of the summer and a well-deserved IF. 
Aaron's View: A big win for Huddersfield which could have seen either Mooy or Lossl pick-up IF's but they were very difficult to fit in alongside the other options.
Ilsinho - CAM - Phillidelphia Union
It was the MLS season finale on Sunday and even though they finished way short of the play-offs Philidelphia Union still managed to finish their campaign with a flourish beating Orlando City 6-1. As such there are plenty of IF options here but EA have picked out 5 Star Skiller Ilsinho who scored twice and grabbed himself an assist as well. This will be a popular IF for sure. The MLS focus now shifts to the Play-offs which begin today (26th Oct).
Aaron's View: Overall, three Philadelphia players could have been in TOTW 6. Sarpong with two goals, Ilsinho (of course) and Picault with 2 goals and 1 assist. But instead of choosing from three players in an MLS game, I would rather focus on getting the other options, in more obvious games correct first."

A little disappointing that EA did not go with the European matches again this past week. However, going 3/4 is still something to be proud of. Looking ahead, we are entering the domestic cup finals season for most European leagues, so going forward be prepared for those to monopolize the predictions. With the Team of the Season revving up, now is the time to start trying to plan ahead so you can maximize your packs and coins. 
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to be selected:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Juventus vs AC Milan
Match Info: Kicking us off this week is Italy’s domestic cup final. The sleeper section is jam packed with cup finals itself; however, I felt a matchup of this profile would be hard to pass up for EA. Interestingly, both teams feature in high profile Calcio A matches over in this cycle as well with Juventus hosting Roma & AC Milan vs Atalanta. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Betis vs Sevilla 
Match Info:  A huge rivalry steals the show in La Liga this cycle, and this matchup between the two Sevilla teams seems to consistently find a slot in the Marquee Matchup SBC. Plenty of non-rare golds, so this could be a very profitable SBC depending on the pack reward. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Seattle vs Portland
Match Info: Moving across the Atlantic to the MLS where two teams on the West Coast square off in a high intensity derby. Always a crazy atmosphere when these two teams meet, and although the MLS has featured a couple times recently, I believe that trend will continue. Highest rated non-rares are the way to go here.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Basel vs Young Boys
Match Info: Capping off the main picks this week, we head to Switzerland. The top two teams in the league, and fierce rivals,  meet in a match that should conclude Switzerland’s representation in the Marquee Matchups for the foreseeable future.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
There’s never four clear locks for Marquee Matchups, and we would not be doing our due diligence as investors if we didn’t consider additional fixtures. With already plenty of writing above, we’re going to keep this section short this week, and just hit you with the essentials: 
Spartak Moscow vs Dynamo Moscow
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


PAOK vs AEK Athens 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Al Faisaly vs Al Ittihad
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Malmo vs Djurgarden
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
This section finally came through after a month of disappointments. That being said this section is for the really outlandish picks, so we are going to continue to drop two picks in here just for the fun of it. 
Wisla Krakow vs Lech Poznan or Nantes vs Anger
Recap
If you're new to Marquee Matchup investing take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team. 
With plenty of big games to choose from we would love to hear your picks below! Also, feel free to share your thoughts on any games we missed."

As was teased on Twitter by Tom Caleffi, the MLS Cup version of Sebastian Giovinco was going to get an upgrade at some point soon as a part of the Retro Stars promo. With his Twitter poll offering the options of ST, CF and CAM, ST was the clear winner with 52% of the near 5000 votes.
However, no one could have predicted what would happen with a 97-rated version of the 'Atomic Ant' Giovinco being released in all three positions! Each will have identical requirements, so you are able to pick which one you want to complete or purchase from the market. To give a bit more variety, each has slightly different boosts. All will provide +3 Acceleration to your team, but the [ST version] will give +2 Finishing, the [CF Version] will give +2 Ball Control, and the [CAM Version] will give +2 Dribbling to your roster.
On top of that, we have two other players to get our teeth into.
Firstly, Southampton's keeper Fraser Forster is the latest player from the St Patrick's Day promo to receive an upgrade, as he moves from 90 to 96 Overall. With his height, he is certainly going to be an excellent keeper, who will be an upgrade for many people. His boosts of +2 Marking and +1 Awareness aren't to be scoffed at either.
Finally, another old favourite from the Out Of Position pack promo is receiving an upgrade. Juan Cuadrado's move to RWB made him a great buy due to his amazing attacking stats when Overall wasn't as important as it is now. However, this upgrade, which sees him jump from 81 to 92 Overall, also includes a position change back to his original Right Midfielder position. Offering boosts of +1 Speed and +1 Dribbling offer a good alternative to anyone who prefers the Rainbow skill move, and doesn't yet have the upgraded LvL Juan Mata."

FIFA 18's worldwide is right around the corner and EA SPORTS FIFA has continued to keep us salivating until the game's full release. Tantalizing gamers as per usual, EA SPORTS FIFA's marketing team dropped a cinematic commercial honoring their ""More Than A Game"" slogan. The ad encompasses legends of the game, rap duo Run The Jewels, various social media apps, plus NBA MVP finalist James Harden. 
Watch as Real Madrid winger and FIFA 18 cover star Cristiano Ronaldo makes fiction a reality as he scores an unbelievable goal both in the game and in real life (points to EA for throwing Antoine Grizemann's reaction in the video). 
The purpose of the commercial is to increase the game's hype, and that's exactly what it did. The visuals and music (Run The Jewels' Mean Demeanor ""Tornado Mix"") offered an enjoyable commercial for all FIFA fans alike. 
FIFA 18 is set to launch September 29, 2017. Before you play, watch the commercial and drown yourself in the hype."

Leveraging the full power of EA's second year with the Frostbite engine, ""The Journey"" (or think more like Mass Effect)-esque cut scenes are coming to FIFA 18's Career Mode, allowing you to negotiate transfers more dynamically than ever before.

All the new features coming to Career Mode in FIFA 18

Of note, the now multi-tier negotiations include the likes of Sell-On fees, more real time counter negotiations, a stage where you negotiate directly with the player and his agent on things like wages and release clause, and as has become customary after big in-real-life transfers, press conferences unveiling your big new acquisition. The game also has added new animated cut scenes for when players win Premier League Player of the Month or you win a big cup final or lock up the league.
A bit buried in the mix is the revelation that FIFA 18's added 15+ new skill games, which of course make their way into training in Career Mode. You can also now use training to help a player's return from injury.
Chris Wood, aka ""ChesnoidGaming"", bring us the first official FIFA 18 video of any kind, including quite a bit of juicy game footage from the new Career Mode. Check it out and let us know what you think about these new tweaks and/or features:

INTRO
The Centre Forward (CF) position was one which has received very little attention in terms of good players to upgrade your team. The original CF, Domination James Rodriguez was converted to CAM by a significant majority of players, leaving a gap in the attacks of many teams.
However, this has been rectified with a sudden surge in CF’s who you can use in the 4-4-1-1 formation, or just keep in your squad to help give a little extra boost, with the likes of 99 Overall England Heroes Wayne Rooney, 99 Overall End of an Era Francesco Totti, 97 Retro Stars Sebastian Giovinco and now, the best of the bunch, 100 Overall Pre-Season Fernando Torres. 
FIFA Mobile’s upcoming reset has produced a plethora of top-of-the-range players, each with +1 Overall, that you can get through grinding different game modes or playing, so in the coming weeks, I will be taking a look at some of the ones who I think may be more worthwhile doing, and letting you know how they play in game, in order to help you make your decision as to who to aim to complete.
Let’s take a look at his stats:

I must admit, I built him before even looking at his stats as I was in need of a good CF to upgrade my team, so some of his stats are surprisingly low from what they felt like when using him.
His pace is boosted to 112 in my team which, when combined with his excellent dribbling and ball control, made it very difficult for defenders to catch and stop. He definitely isn’t the fastest of players I’ve used, but he isn’t a slouch by any means.
This pace, combined with his 100 strength made it very difficult for anyone to be able to beat him in a race to goal. On the odd occasion where he was tackles by a defender, he normally won a free kick, which seems like a feat in itself when playing against such high rated opponents as I was testing him against.
His 99 finishing may not look that good, but he doesn’t disappoint when put through against the keeper. A simple curl around them, working equally well from both sides of the goal, led to a goal almost every time, as his stats below will show.
STATS
To test him out, I used the Basic and Target Man variations of the 4411 formation, which is sadly the only formation which he can be used in. However, the lack of many top quality CF’s does mean that it is very rarely countered - I only had to skip one game where an opponent had all three variations of 4411 countered, the majority had all of them free for me to use. 
To test him out for this review, I played 25 games across League Championships, League vs League Tournaments and Versus Attack Mode, and faced teams rated between 108 and 124 Overall.
These were his stats after those 25 games:
Goals: 81
Assists: 15
When I checked the final stats, I was amazed at how well he had done. His goals and assists helped me get to my highest ever VsA rank and fan count, even beating some opponents with far superior teams. No matter who I was facing, he was guaranteed to score at least a couple of goals, making him one of my favourite players that I’ve used in recent months.
One game I did lose was against a 119 Overall team, and my opponent was also using this version of Torres. I lost 9-7, with his Torres scoring 5 of the goals, so it shows that he is not just a goal-scoring machine for me, or that my games were easy in some way.

REVIEW
As I touched on above, Torres isn’t the fastest of players but he isn’t exactly slow either. I would say he is ‘just fast enough’ to be able to be effective but not too slow that defenders are able to catch up to him and get the ball off him easily.
His standout attribute is definitely his finishing, which is up there with the best of players in the game this year. Think Torres in his first couple of seasons at Liverpool, but on steroids. No matter where he is inside 20 yards, he will almost certainly score. With the Target Man formations, you need a striker who is capable of scoring consistently from both sides as you never know where they will start. I don’t know if it is because he is right footed, unlike Upgraded Blue Star Eden Hazard, Attack Mode Master Antoine Griezmann and World Qualifiers Master Gareth Bale, but he seems to score curling shots around the keeper from the left hand side with far greater consistency.
On top of his excellent finishing from open play, he has made corners a proper goalscoring opportunity again rather than just a waste of time as I kick the ball out of play. From either side, he is always the player lurking unmarked around the penalty spot, so a simple chip to him, turn the defender closing you down, and then curl it in at the far post works wonders almost every time. His exceptional ball control also helps here, as he is able to keep the ball right at his feet at all times during the brief spell he has with the ball, making it even more difficult for a defender to nip in and take the ball off of his toe.
The final thing which Torres can boast is his surprising strength. His 100 card stat may not look to impressive, but he had no problem holding off even the strongest of defenders like Ultimate Team of the Season Kalidou Koulibaly or Player of the Month Benjamin Mendy. On the rare occasion that he was pushed off the ball, he seemed to earn a foul every time which, due to his ability to hold off the defenders for so long, was normally within easy scoring distance. 
Even his passing was generally solid. Passing it across goal, or a short chipped cross to a free teammate in the box was always on point. Perhaps my only real ‘downside’ to him was that for longer passes he could sometimes miss-hit them or misdirect them, resulting in the ball being lost, but the number of times that you will need to play such a long ball is very low so that hardly makes a significant impact.
SUMMARY
Starting at the top, he isn’t the fastest of players that I’ve used this year, so if you are looking for a player who is able to just outpace any defender who comes near him, you may be better to pass on Torres and look to buy someone like Retro Stars Sebastian Giovinco, but honestly it doesn’t matter.
His 99 finishing is up there with some of the best that I have used this year, and his ability to finish from either side is perfect for the 4411 Target Man formation, where he can start from both sides and cut in to shoot without much of a disadvantage if he is on the left. Moreover, he is one of the few players who I am able to consistently score from corners with - more so than Hazard, Bale and Griezmann.
In the few occasions where you need to pass with him, he can be a little temperamental with his long range passing, but there are very few occasions where I needed to pass for any significant distance. That is probably the only slight criticism that I could find with him.
Finally, and I’d say most importantly, the combination of his dribbling and strength is some of the best in the game. His close control and roulette are very tight, which when combined with his very decent pace and incredible strength, mean that he is almost impossible to push off the ball and simply leads to far more goalscoring opportunities than a weaker attacker may give you.
After being a fan of using wingers, mainly 4321 and 433, for so many months, I have changed my main formation in all game modes to 4411, just so that I can use Torres because he is that good.
I know that the 100 Overall may be out of reach for many people, but even the slightly lower Overall versions, such as the 98 or 99, are just very slightly lower in terms of stats so will no doubt be almost as good as him, along with the excellent +2 Ball Control and +4 Awareness boosts to all that the 99 rated version offers you.

We can go ahead and mark another potential major FIFA 18 launch milestone on the calendar. At least probably.
As surfaced in Microsoft's Xbox Store app on the Xbox One console, it appears EA SPORTS' next edition of the popular FIFA series will follow a similar pattern with its forthcoming demo drop date. Two weeks before the game's official retail release, the FIFA 18 demo looks to be set to go live September 15, 2017. While it's as yet confirmed at this time, it seems a virtual certainty the PlayStation 4 demo will fall on the same day at roughly the same time.
Given time zones and recent history, those who go to great lengths to change their console's region to New Zealand/Australia/etc may be able to gain access as early as the 14th.
This release certainly feels anecdotally later than in recent years, but when you consider the game's official launch falls on the fairly recently standardized title release day of Friday, it's a little less jarring. What it does mean though is Xbox users who are subscribers to EA Access will have all of five days between when the demo drops and the 10 hour prelaunch trial is expected to go live. That, if anything, is a departure from recent norms.
Here's a screenshot from an Xbox One that shows the now expected demo release date:"

FIFA Ultimate Team 18's eighth and latest Team of the Week isn't too shabby.
In no surprise to our in-house TOTW guru, Aaron Grimmer, TOTW 8 features two Ones to Watch players getting ratings increases. Liverpool's Mohamed Salah's strong match rating and goal scoring prowess along with Kylian Mbappe Lottin's outstanding afternoon see them both get the boosts many of us had hoped for. And Salah's IF is at striker, making it perhaps as covetous as the OTW itself.
Marseille's Florian Thauvin provides the perfect boards dropdown troll as a French RW this week while Mats Hummels, Leighton Baines, and the US's all-time (co-)goal scoring king, Clint Dempsey, are probably the most enticing from the rest of the field.

With a new set of VsA players in VsA Season 2 comes a rethought Weekend Tournament now stylised as The Gauntlet. Harking back to the very first Weekend Tournaments, The Gauntlet follows the ""3 strikes and you're out"" idea quite literally. Capping out at 25 wins with unlimited buy ins, The Gauntlet should provide some fresh variety to your FIFA Mobile team. The Gauntlet this week requires a 70-90 OVR team of 11 VsA S2 players, check them out here.
The Gauntlet
Like previous Weekend Tournaments, entry into The Gauntlet costs 50k coins on the first try, then costs 5 WT vouchers or 500 FP to reenter. You can also 'continue' for FP, which we'll look into a little later. The format for The Gauntlet is simple, win as many games (up to 25) as you can and 'buy out' before you hit your 3rd loss. If you are on 2 losses consider cashing out instead of risking a third loss as you'll have to buy back in with FP/WT vouchers with no rewards to show for your efforts.
One reward per run
Once you claim a reward, that's it -- your Gauntlet run is over -- so make sure you know which reward you want and don't accidentally claim the wrong one. Once you've passed over a reward and gotten your next win, you'll lose the ability to claim that previous reward as well. So you'll have to weigh if it's worth risking getting your third loss to go for a potentially more lucrative prize. If you want more than one reward, you'll have to start a new run for each one.
The Rewards
A plethora of rewards awaits with coins, SBs, XP and players galore. Consider claiming the random Team Hero reward if you're aiming towards TH Müller, or the random Icon reward to get a chance at some of the newest Icons such as Patrick Vieira or Roberto Carlos. You can also claim a random Euro Star Master (91+) or even 50 VsA points to help you earn those Bonus Rewards. 
If you missed out on La Liga Rivalries Gareth Bale or EAster David Alaba, you have your chance to pick up one of them here, you'll need at least 14 wins for Bale, and at least 18 for Alaba, so good luck in your pursuits. Diego Maradona's Prime Icon was released as the ultimate VsA S2 reward, and you could get your hands on his normal 91 CAM Icon item should you get at least 23 wins. 
Also, on offer at 11 and 25 wins respectively are new Weekend Tournament players 89 RF Kylian Mbappé and 93 CB Giorgio Chiellini. If you reach 25 wins and claim Chiellini, the next time you reach 25 wins the last reward will change to 7.5 million coins, so if you're a WT VsA master, it may just be worthwhile for a 500 FP buy in.
Buy back in
If you reach your 3rd loss on 24 wins and really wanted Chiellini but can't be bothered trying to string together another 25 wins, you can continue where you left off for a FP cost. The cost to continue increases the more wins you had, so if you don't have enough FP you may have to start from scratch. Alternatively, consider throwing your third game instead of trying for more wins to reduce the FP cost to continue if you don't want to finish just yet.
Once you've claimed a reward, you can restart the Gauntlet for 500 FP or 5 WT vouchers. You'll start again at 0 wins, but won't be able to claim any rewards you've previously claimed. This means that you could grab every single reward (at a hefty 12k FP cost) should you so wish. 
Guide
You can claim multiple rewards, albeit for accumulating costs to reenter The Gauntlet each time, so I would advise you choose two or three rewards you are aiming for. One 'low tier', one 'mid tier', and one 'high tier'. This way if you find yourself marooned on 7 wins/2 losses and really wanted Gareth Bale at 14 wins, but also had your eyes set on a Random Team Hero, you can claim the Random Team Hero and try again for Bale.  This also means that should you pass 14 wins with no losses, you can consider going further to get David Alaba instead. Having an idea of what you want will make The Gauntlet more beneficial to you. 
As mentioned before, if you're on two losses and are one or two wins away from a reward and don't think you'll get there without losing, consider deliberately losing your next match and continuing with FP. Be careful though, as the FP cost to continue grows increasingly larger the more wins you rack up. Don't forget that three losses means you can't claim any rewards at all, weigh this up before you start what could be your third loss.
Useful rewards:

7 wins - Random TH
9 wins - 250 Gold+ players, useful for SBCs, potential for a few Elites
11 wins - 89 RF WT Kylian Mbappé
12 wins - A random base Icon
14 wins - 91 RM LLR Gareth Bale
17 wins - 91+ Euro Star player
18 wins - 93 LB EAster David Alaba
21 wins - 50 VsA tokens
23 wins - 91 CAM Diego Maradona
25 wins - 93 CB WT Giorgio Chiellini (first time)
25 wins - 7.5 million coins (repeated wins)

Summary
No more SBCs to claim rewards should be popular, and some huge resource rewards (3,500 SBs for 24 wins, 1.5 million XP for 22 wins, 5 million coins for 20 wins) will be very welcome if this repeats every week. Massive rewards are on offer, even for low wins (750 SBs for 6 wins is 15k FP based on the Store). The 90 OVR cap creates an even playing field and places emphasis on skill once again, the wide variety of VsA S2 players should see some interesting formations around. Only claiming one reward per run makes The Gauntlet more strategic now and actually provides incentive to retry it. A great selection of rewards whether you need coins, SBs or XP, The Gauntlet has huge potential."

If you felt a bit let down by the previous week's Team of the Week, perhaps this FIFA Ultimate Team offering will be more your speed.
Led by a striking 90-overall LF Alexis Sanchez and reinforced by the likes of 88 Samir Handanovic, 85 Nicolas Otamendi, 85 Riyad Mahrez, and for the bants, an 88-rated left midfielder Andres Iniesta, TOTW 6 by and large delivers. A few lower profile offerings, including Leverkusen's Julian Brand, Marseille's Luiz Gustavo, Valencia's Goncalo Guedes, and yes, even Twitter hero Michy Batshuayi add to the overaching appeal.

The people clammored for more from FUT Halloween and, well, they got it.
Ultimate Scream players are boosted once again all weekend -- a bit of a surprise given the beginning of FUT Champions qualifying for the first competitive LAN event -- in honor of an apparent full moon. Joining in the unpredictability of the full moon spirit are two more league Squad Buildling Challenges, these from a bit less primary leagues.
Representing England's second-tier, the Championship, is Reading central defender Liam Moore. The 74 centerback gets a nice boost up to 80 overall. From the Eredivise is German Ajax winger Amin Younes. Younes was popular in some Squad Buildling Challenges a year ago and now gets a pretty pacey player item for it. You can find out how to do Moore's Championship SBCs here and Younes' Eredivise themed ones here.
Surely virtually no one expected either of these leagues to be next, and even fewer expected the Scream Boosts. If you held out on the Hernandez, Petit, or Schmeichel SBCs, those seem potentially a lot more palpable here a day later."

A cracking set of predictions this week, leaves us with just six unpredictables to look at, the vast majority of which came from mid-week or mid-table clashes, which can often make preditions more diffuclt. Let's see why these guys made TOTW 31! 
Ryan Babel - LM - Besiktas
The Turkish Super Lig title race is hotter than Elizabeth Hurley’s Instagram at the moment, with just three points separating the top four sides with five games to go. And Besiktas did their part on Friday night to keep the pressure on leaders Galatasaray with a comfortable 3-0 win against Akhisarspor. Ryan Babel did the damage in this one scoring twice to net his eleventh and twelfth goals of the season. In ten days’ time Besiktas go to Galatasaray in what could be the crucial match for all the top four sides in Turkey. 
Aaron's View: Two goals for Babel, but with Mariano (who I felt was a certainty this week) already in my prediction, I just couldn’t justify a second Turkish league player.
Ricardo Pereira - RB - Porto
Another title race going to the wire is the Liga NOS where Benfica took on Porto last weekend. Before the game Benfica held a slender one-point lead over their opponents giving this match more of an edge than usual. And there was major drama late on as the game looked to be petering out in to a 0-0 draw, before Hector Herrera became the hero scoring the winner in the 89th minute for Porto. Ricardo Pereira picks up the SIF for his MOTM display which included 7 tackles, 5 clearances and 5 dribbles from full back.
Aaron's View: *It’s funny how things work out in prediction land sometimes as I incorrectly took a punt on Pereira last week. And yet for an almost identical performance this week, he makes the TOTW. And that’s how it goes. *
Kamil Grosicki - LM - Hull City
Hull City should be safe for another season of Championship football after two wins in their last three games eased the pressure of relegation somewhat. One of those wins was a hammering of lowly Burton Albion who were put to the sword 5-0. Kamil Grosicki scored twice, either side of a FUT pro David Meyler penalty to secure his IF. This was a Tuesday night game however which makes it much tougher to confidently make predictions on. 
Aaron's View: A difficult one to predict considering that Grosicki’s goals came in midweek before Hull then lost 1-0 on Saturday. Two goals for the winger always put him in contention but he wasn’t short of competition this week by any means.
Zlatan Alomerovic - GK - Korona Kielce
Kornona Kielce took on the Polish league leaders on Friday night and with a weakened team they produced a creditable performance and an even better result, winning 1-0. The story of the match however was the penalty save from Zlatan Almoerovic which maintained the 35th minute strike from team mate Sanel Kadidzic. Great performance. 
Aaron's View: It’s a shame that the Argentine keeper with a penalty save, goal and clean sheet misses out this week. Whilst Alomerovic also performed well making six saves, one of which was from the spot in their shock 1-0 win over Poznana, I still can’t help but feel that he was easilly overshadowed.
Adriano Grimaldi - ST - SC Preussen Munster
Over to the third tier of German football now where Preussen Munster took on Fortuna Koln in a mid-table clash where the away side ran out as comfortable winners 4-2. Adriano Grimaldi scored two of those and grabbed an assist as well. That takes Grimaldi to 11 goals for the season from 24 matches.

Aaron's View: With Harboui missing out for 7 goals in 2 games I can’t help but feel that both the striker options I missed this week were weak. Grimaldi scored twice and with only a few hat tricks the reserves were always going to be difficult.
Gjermund Asen - LF – Tromso
And finally, we head over to Norway where another mid-week games has eluded our predictions maestro. Tromso took on Stromsgodset in yet another mid-table clash this week which generates an IF. And Gjermund Asen is the beneficiary after setting up all three of Tromso’s goals in their 3-1 win. 
Aaron's View: Three assists for a striker isn’t something you see very often, and because of that I seriously considered Asen. That was until another Norwegian striker scored three goals and after that I just couldn’t see Asen making the cut.

Bonus: A look back at TOTW 30's swings and misses
After predicting a couple of big hitters which didn't make the TOTW 30 first eleven, Aaron finished strongly and mopped up most of the bench and reserves to leave eight unpredictable players this week. Let's checkout the guys we failed to pick-up back in TOTW 30 as well. 
Thorgan Hazard – LM – Borussia Monchengladbach
It was all looking rather rosy for Hertha Berlin during the first half of their game against Borussia Monchengladbach, with Solomon Kalou opening the scoring to take them in to the break 1-0 up. But then super-sub Thorgan Hazard entered the fray and made an instant impact, scoring twice in four second half minutes to steal the win for the home side. Not bad for 45 minutes of football.

Aaron's View: Another week, another wrong position for me with Hazard being listed as a ST on my personal shortlist, and that's why I didn't pick him. 
Gabriel Paulista – CB – Valencia
Valencia had won five games in a row in La Liga and looked set to secure Champions League football with plenty of room to spare. Their latest win a week ago was a tight 1-0 win against Espanyol where Rodrigo Moreno scored in the first 6 minutes of the match. Gabriel Paulista picked up the IF for his contribution of six clearances, three tackles and three interceptions which helped to preserve the clean sheet for Los Che.
Aaron's View: With no goals or assists to his name Paulista was always going to be difficult to predict. That decision was made even harder with the IF coming from a 1-0 win against Espanyol who themselves are fighting against relegation.
Aritz Elustondo – RB – Real Sociedad
Real Sociedad look set to finish safe in mid-table in La Liga this season, but even though they have little play for they still managed to thump this seasons overachievers Girona 5-0 weekend after later. The in-form, however, did not go to any of the goal scorers, and instead landed with Aritz Elustondo, who picked up one assist from right back for this second IF of FIFA 18. 
Aaron's View:  A second difficult defender to predict from Spain who pretty much falls under the exact same circumstances as Paulista above.
Joe Hart – GK – West Ham
West Ham had given their Premier League survival hopes a welcome boost in the last few weeks by taking four points from their last two matches (until this week, natch). But after Chicharito hadlevelled things up in the second half, it was over to Joe Hart to maintain that crucial point making some fantastic saves as Chelsea came on strong.
Aaron's View: With three very strong goalkeeping candidates already in Oblak, Adler and Sirigu I never considered Hart who was a mile off all three of those options in my opinion.
Pablo Armero – LB – America De Cali
In a bottom of the table clash in Columbia America De Cali took on Boyacha Chico FC in what ended up being a bad-tempered affair which saw three players sent off. America De Cali managed to capitalise on that man advantage scoring three goals, of which Pablo Amero scored one and assisted another from left back for his TOTW 30 IF. 
Aaron's View: But here's one I really should have got. A goal, an assist and a clean sheet for a gold defender. I just missed Amero completely when going through the weeks games.
Arkadiusz Reca – LB – Wisla Plock 
Jagiellonia had a chance to go top of the Polish League two weekends ago but unfortuanetly they couldn't get past Wisla Plock who took all three points winning the game 3-1. And it was Arkadiusz Reca who was the dangerman scoring two goals in ten first half minutes from left back. That was enough for his IF, and it kept the title race in Poland on a knife edge with just a point separating three sides.

Aaron's View: With the sheer amount of goals this week I didn’t even consider adding a reserve defender but Reca is a fair shout from EA after he scored twice in a 3-1 win.
Teemu Pukki – ST – Brondby IF
Brondby made light work of their second play-off match in the Danish Super League two Saturdays ago by thrashing Horsens 5-1 at home. Teemu Pukki bagged himself a hat-trick in this one which was more than enough to secure his third IF of FUT 18.
Aaron's View: I was unsure if this game was going to count with it being a playoff and with similar options missing out in the past two weeks. With the amount of hat tricks scored this week, Pukki was the unfortunate one who missed out.
Alex Schalk – ST – Ross County FC
And finally, we head over to Ross County who had just one win in their last 18 Scottish Premier League matches before they took on bottom club Partick Thistle. But that fact aside they put in a great display scoring four, three of which were put in by TOTW 30's Alex Schalk. It was a crucial win as well by Ross County.
Aaron's View: Alex Schalk is another player with a hat trick but it was always likely I was going to miss a couple with the amount of them being scored this week. I narrowed it down without midweek games which are often temperamental and therefore Schalk missed out for me."

            Updated on
            



Last week's score: 16/23
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad link: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7777446/


Goalkeeper
Antonio Mirante - GK - OVR 81
The keepers were by far the biggest challenge faced this week with none particularly making a claim. There were several good performances, but none that instantly stood out. I have selected Antonio Mirante due to the lack of Italian options; he made a total of five saves to keep Bologna's clean sheet claiming a 7 rating in the process.
Defenders
Martin Mantovani - CB - OVR 75
Martin Mantovani scored the only goal of the game as Leganes came away from Espanyol with all three points via a 1-0 win. Mantovani will be feeling less blue than usual after that performance.
Kamil Glik - CB - OVR 84
Monaco impressed once again with a convincing 6-1 win at home to Marseille of which one if not more Monaco players will receive an in-form from. Kamil Glik, the now Liverpool linked Thomas Lemar and Radamel Falcao are the best option after all three picked up an 8/10 from L'Equipe. A defender that picks up said score very rarely misses out though, and thus for me, Glik is the best option of the three.
Marquinhos - CB - OVR 82
Marquinhos really looks as though he is developing into quite the player; the Brazilian defender impressed one again during PSG's 3-0 home win over St. Etienne. He picked up an assist on one of the three goals and helped defensively to claim a 7/10.
Midfielders
Koke - RM- OVR 84
Unfortunately Koke was played out wide, which pretty much destroys the item he could have been. Despite that, there’s very little doubt surrounding his inclusion in the side after he scored the maximum 3 score from MARCA after scoring twice in Atletico's 5-1 win over Las Palmas.
Marco Asensio - LW - OVR 82
Although Madrid will not be happy with a sole point at home to Valencia, it could have been worse without Spanish wonder kid Asensio. Playing out wide once again for the Galacticos, Asensio scored both of their goals in a 2-2 draw. There are a couple of Valencia players also in with a shout, but with Asensio scoring twice and being a bigger name, I can see EA opting for him.
Nuri Sahin - CM - OVR 80
Lots of top end performances coming from Germany this week with BVB's Nuri Sahin being one of those. The Turkish midfielder scored once and assisted another in Dortmund's 2-0 win claiming a 1.5 from Kicker in the process.
Mohamed Salah - RW - OVR 82
The Prem was extremely difficult to select IFs from this week, and this one was no different. Although I am confident that Liverpool will be picking up an IF, as to who that will be is another question. My punt goes on Salah, who grabbed both a goal and an assist in their impressive 4-0 win over Arsenal. 
Paulo Dybala- CAM - OVR 86
There have been some real debatable Dybala IFs over the course of this FIFA, but for once, he deserves his spot in the side. The Argentine scored three of four Juventus goals as they beat Genoa 4-2 at home.
Forwards
Timo Werner- ST - OVR 77
Werner picked up Bundesliga player of the week, and as we know from the past, that pretty much secures a spot in the side. The pacey striker scored two of Leipzig's four goals in a 4-1 home win over Freiburg.
Lionel Messi - ST - OVR 93
With it being the final few weeks of FIFA 17 and Messi with that one slot available, I can see EA being a little lenient in allowing the final spot. The Argentine magician scored twice for Barcelona, which normally wouldn’t be enough, but under the said circumstances, I really can see the exception.
Substitutes
Koen Casteels - GK - OVR 78
I almost went with just the one keeper this time around, but to keep it realistic, I have a second predicted. Casteels made a total of six saves to keep Wolfsburg's clean sheet intact and secure them three points while claiming himself keeper of the week in Germany.
Felix Bastians - CB - OVR 74
Although one of Bastians' goals did come from the spot in Bochum's narrow 3-2 win, the fact that he featured in Bundes 2 TOTW and has two goals to his name goes a long way in this selection process. There were very few options in the substitute area, and thus Bastians looks set to pick up a spot.
Chancel Mbemba - LB - OVR 77
Although it was Clarke who found himself on the scoresheet in Newcastle's 3-0 home win over West Ham, it was fellow defender Mbemba who stood out. Mbemba played in an unusual LB role due to injury, but made a claim to keep that spot with a brilliant defensive display which earned him MOTM.
Jens Toornstra - CM - OVR 76
There are a few Feyenoord players which could pick up an IF after their 5-0 home win to make it three from three to start the season. I believe it is between Jens Toornstra, who I have selected for scoring two of the five, and their RB, Kevin Diks, could also feature for claiming two assists.
Moussa Konate - ST - OVR 74
Nice were beyond impressive last season, but the start to this one is anything but losing 3-0 to newly promoted Amiens SC. Moussa Konate scored two of the three and picked up a 7/10 for doing so. Very limited on options this week which will work in the big leagues' favour.
Stefano Pettinari - ST - OVR 61
It's been a few weeks since I predicted a bronze item to pick up an IF, but the wait is over with Stefano Pettinari after he managed to find the net three times for Pescara in their dominant 5-1 home win over Foggia to start their season in style.
Tom Eaves - ST - OVR 63
Just when one comes, another appears. Tom Eaves is the second bronze to make my prediction after the Gillingham striker scored three goals in a thrilling 3-3 draw with Southend.
Reserves
Holger Badstuber - CB - OVR 79
Badstuber scored the sole goal of the other game alongside picking up the same score as Timo Werner, who was player of the week. Considering that this comes from a defender, the chances are he will be in and thus makes my prediction.
Hans Vanaken - CM - OVR 76
Vanaken always looked very promising and although he has arguably not lived up to his potential as of late, he is still a big player for Brugge. The Belgian scored two and assisted another in Brugge's 4-0 home win.
Suso - RW - OVR 80
I incorrectly predicted Suso to pick up his SIF last week, but I am taking pretty much the exact same punt this week. The Spaniard once again was crucial for Milan, picking up both a goal and assist in their 2-1 win over Cagliari.
Kamil Grosicki - LW - OVR 77
Grosicki in the championship just doesn't add up to be with the Polish winger being more than capable of bigger things. He is starting for Hull though and looks impressive every time he plays. The Tigers managed a 4-0 win at home to Bolton this week of which Grosicki scored one and assisted another two in.
Esteban Paredes - ST - OVR 75
We end the prediction with an obvious choice in Paredes. The Chilean scored three goals during Colo-Colo's 4-1 home win to continue his impressive scoring record over the past few seasons."

FIFA 18's third patch has finally hit PC and, as EA has announced in their forum, will be coming to next gen consoles in the coming weeks.
After roughly a month of FIFA 18 gameplay behind and a pair of FUT Champions Weekend Leagues in the books, the third patch offers some welcome improvements to FIFA (Most notably: The audio levels for the Cristinao Ronaldo celebration) and fixes to a handful of glitches that you may not have even encountered.
Courtesy of EA's forums, here are the complete third FIFA 18 patch release notes for PC. The emphasis is ours:

The latest title update for FIFA 18 is now available for PC. This update will be available on XB1 and PS4 in the coming weeks.
This update includes the following changes:
Made the following changes in Gameplay:

Made ground passes and ground through passes less effective when blindly passing the ball between 90 and 270 degrees, where 0 degrees is the direction the player is facing.
The most significant impact will be seen when the pass angle is between 140 and 220 degrees.
The impact scales when the pass angle is between 90 (least impact) and 139 degrees and between 221 and 270 (least impact) degrees
The passes impacted by this change will see: 
Reduced ball speed.
Reduced accuracy.


Disabled user controlled reactions, when locked to a player, when the goalkeeper is holding the ball.


Addressed the following issues in Gameplay:

The goalkeeper sometimes parrying the ball into his own goal.
The goalkeeper diving too early on downward header and volley shots.
Players sometimes becoming invisible during a match.
Dragbacks not working when rapidly tapping the modifier button.
Players being unable to string together multiple stepovers.
The goalkeeper, in some situations, being unable to throw the ball after making a save close to the goal line.
The player automatically passing the ball from a set piece after the game had been paused in an Online match.
An issue with Custom controls where movement with the directional buttons was not working when locked to a player.


Made the following changes in FIFA Ultimate team:

Added the Objectives tile to the Pause Menu in all FUT Online modes.
Added Guest Mode in FUT Online Seasons and FUT Online Draft.
Disabled the FIFA Trainer within FUT Champions.


Addressed the following issues in FIFA Ultimate team:

An issue in Squad Building Challenges where tagging a group of challenges would make it unselectable.
ICONs displaying their current age on in-game overlays.
Wrong badge showing for your opponent on the Online Season's Match Preview screens.
Objective Completed visual notification not displaying correctly for some Daily/Weekly Objectives.
Alignment of the text on Manager League items.
An issue with the effects shown during the pack opening animation.
The icon of your rank in Squad Battles displaying incorrectly when claiming rewards.


Addressed the following issues in Online Modes:

Players crashing when matching up in Pro Clubs Friendly Matches in certain situations.
Players would not receive invites in Pro Clubs Friendly Matches in certain situations.


Addressed the following issues in Career Mode:

Players crashing during the first game of the season in certain situations.


Made the following changes in Audio / Visual / Presentation:

Updated the Chile National Team kits and crest to be authentic.


Addressed the following issues in Audio / Visual / Presentation:

The volume of the audio in the Cristiano Ronaldo celebration.
Some issues with crowd flags displaying the wrong images.
Some visual issues with the Bundesliga broadcast package.
Situations where the ball would appear to go through the goal netting.
An issue where a player on the ground would incorrectly animate as flipping or spinning.
Celebrations clipping through ad boards.


It remains to be seen how noticeable the changes to pass accuracy will be with the adjustment to blind passing at specific angles, but the adjustments to goalkeepers will certainly satisfy those who requested further changes be made. But, more importantly, get your final high volume ""Siiiiiiiiiiiii""'s in with Ronaldo while you still can."

EA Sports have not spared any expense on the first day of the full release of FIFA 18. In addition to Ones to Watch items, they've also released the first-ever Premier League Player of the Month item. Liverpool's star winger Sadio Mane won the award for August, so he is the recipient of the first POTM SBC of the new FIFA season. 
Mane's new POTM card, which has a brand new design this year, is an 87-rated LW card with 95 pace, 89 dribbling, and 83 shooting.

If you're looking to acquire this beauty for your club, it's going to cost you a pretty penny. The SBC requirements to obtain it are very steep. Four different challenges will require you to submit high rated Premier League players, Senagalese players, players from Mane's previous clubs (RB Salzburg, Southamption, FC Metz), and even Sane himself.

EA have also included a much-less expensive SBC challenge with a loan SBC Mane as the prize. This would be great for a run in Squad Battles or the Weekend League without the long-term ramifications of spends all those lovely coins. 
There it is. One of the best Premier League players has gotten better thanks to his fabulous month of August. Are you buying, loaning, or avoiding?"

One of the biggest early controversies of FIFA 18 seems resolved in a way that surely few if anyone in the community can take much umbrage against.
When it was revealed that Ronaldo ""R9"" Nazario, the La Liga and Brazillian all-time great, would have a four-star weak foot and arguably even more egregiously, just four-star skill moves on his Icon items in the game, fans, pros, and influencers alike took to social media with pitchforks. At the FIFA 18 London Capture event even, breakfast debates often centered back to whether or not FIFA's stats guys would cave and give R9 the bump he sorely deserved.
Worry no more. Both the 94-rated edition and 96 Prime version of Ronaldo now feature five-star in both key statistical departments. R9 can deservedly do his own signature skill move, and all the YouTube videos, highlights, and memories for those of in the, let's say wiser demographics, can live in harmony with the abilities of his FUT equivalent. The 90-rated ""Baby"" Icon will continue to have just a four-star weak foot and four-star skill moves, which while perhaps still disagreeable to some, seems like a more than fair compromise.
What do you think of EA's stats team's about face? And how impossibly expensive did R9 just become across both the PlayStation and Xbox One markets with these developments?"

With Pre-Order releases now in the wild and our friends on PlayStation 4 able to join the fun those on Xbox One have been experiencing for at least 10 or more hours of the eight days, a second FIFA 18 Ultimate Team Team of the Week is here.
Once again, the new bronze-to-silver and silver-to-gold in-form upgrade system rears its not-so-ugly head (well, unless you're some kind of old school bronze/silver loyalist, I suppose) and along with it some pretty interesting in-form player items.
94 CF Lionel Messi deservedly draws the majority of the hype but a couple other tasty items caught our eyes; 89 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and 86 Cesar Azpilicueta certainly bring the heat as well. All this and remember that Ones to Watch are expected to drop Friday as well.

We are now half a year into FIFA Mobile Season Two, and we begina another month of Matchups begins. With this being the last month of action for the majority of the European leagues, so expect some title deciders, relegation battles and nervy European deciding crunch matches to feature. After last week’s successful 4/4 prediction, we have five games to predict again this week, so let’s get straight into things as we try to get another perfect score as we predict some very tough games.

Barcelona v Real Madrid
We start off with the biggest game of the weekend by far with the La Liga champions and the favourites in the Champions League final facing off in Barcelona, where the majority of the attention before the game is whether Real Madrid will give their opponents a guard of honour.
Barcelona sealed the title in emphatic style last week, winning 4-2 against Deportivo thanks to a Messi hattrick after Coutinho’s opener. There were no doubt some fans who would have preferred them to wait until this week to see them win the title against their biggest competitor of late, but a title win that they can gloat about will no doubt go down just as well. With just four points at home dropped all season, they are in fine form and a positive result in this tie should give them the perfect opportunity to go an entire season undefeated in the league.
Real came through a very tough Champions League second leg against Bayern, and will no doubt have some tired legs going into this game. They seem to have guaranteed at least a third placed finish with a game in hand over both Atletico Madrid and Valencia, who are four points ahead and behind them respectively. Their form hasn’t been insanely good, with four draws and a loss in their last eight games, and only winning those three games by a 2-1 scoreline. However away from home they have won their last six games, four being 2-1 and the other two being more comfortable 3-0 victories. Their away form at the start of the season was not the best, but they have recovered in recent months and have picked up 34 points from 48 available this season.
These are always too close to call, with six of the last eight games between the two being won by the away side. Barcelona won the reverse fixture 3-0 in the Bernabeu just before Christmas, which will just add extra motivation to beat their opponents and complete the first domestic double in El Clasico since they managed it back in 2013/14.
With Barca having home advantage and being well rested, I feel like they are favourites for this one and will come away with three points.
Game played: Sunday 6th, 7:45 p.m. (BST) / 2:45 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Barcelona win

New York Red Bulls v NYCFC
Next we head over to the MLS where the New York sides battle it out for glory.
NYRB sit sixth in the Eastern Conference, with 12 points in their seven games so far this season. They aren't in the best of form, with just three wins in their last eight games and a disappointing CONCACAF semi-final defeat to Guadalajara. They will be hoping to get their first back to back victories of the season.
NYCFC find themselves top of the Eastern Conference, and coming into this game on a massive high after David Villa scored the 400th and 401st goals of his career last week, becoming the fifth player to reach that milestone. Despite a disappointing defeat to Portland Timbers just two weeks ago, they will no doubt be hoping to keep their impressive away record so far which has seen them pick up eight points from their five away games this season.
NYCFC have had the better of their opponents in the past few meetings, with two wins and a draw in the last three games between them. And with both teams in fairly unpredictable form, it makes it this game that bit tougher to try and predict. I'm going with the away side as I feel their form and goalscoring threat in Villa is too much to ignore.
Game played: Saturday 5th, 6:55 p.m. (BST) / 1:55 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: NYCFC win

Chelsea v Liverpool
This could determine who finishes in the top four this season, with Liverpool having played a game more than both Chelsea and Spurs and sitting one point ahead of Spurs and six ahead of Chelsea with two or three games left to play.
Chelsea have found form slightly too late in the season, looking like they will miss out on the Champions League places to Liverpool and Spurs, but know that a win this weekend and then in their game in hand over Liverpool will put them level on points going into the last week of the season. Four wins on the bounce has put them in good form, and they will be hoping to carry that over to face a very difficult opponent.
Liverpool suffered a late scare in the Champions League second leg, edging out a 7-6 aggregate victory after Roma won 4-2 on the night. The past few weeks in the league hasn’t been the best for them, with draws against the two bottom teams in the league as they fielded weakened teams to rest them as they focused on the Champions League. They will be hoping to get back to winning ways to try and keep third place in the league theirs, but that looks to be out of their hands as they sit one point ahead of Spurs, who have a game in hand. 
Sort of as expected, these two are tough to split, with six of the last nine games between the sides ending in a draw - Liverpool with two wins and Chelsea one. With home advantage, and Liverpool most likely resting some players, I feel like Chelsea are favourites for this game. But Liverpool will certainly be up for this game after reaching the Champions League final. I feel like this is Chelsea’s game to lose, but Liverpool have shown how unpredictable they can be in recent weeks, so it is very difficult to tell. I’m going with a draw in this one, but it’s very difficult to pick between them.
Game played: Sunday 6th, 4:30 p.m. (BST) / 11:30 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw

Olympique Marseille v Nice
Not only do Real Madrid and Liverpool have to recover from midweek action, Marseille come into their game in Ligue 1 off the back of a tough Europa League semi-final against RB Salzburg. 
A 2-0 home win gives them a narrow advantage, but it will not be an easy game on Thursday night, with both teams knowing how important scoring the first goal could prove to be. OM have been in solid form, with the third best home record in the league this season and only two losses at home in all competitions this season. With winger Florian Thauvin having the season of his life, and a stat emerging earlier this week showing just how good he has been in terms of goals and assists. They currently sit fourth, and in the Europa League qualification spots for next season, but with just two points separating them, Lyon and Monaco, they will be desperate to win at all costs to try and compete in next season’s Champions League based on league position, rather than having to try and rely on winning the Europa League.
Nice, fronted by everyone’s favourite football bad boy Balotelli, are in a battle of their own to try and sneak into fifth place and earn a qualifier for next season’s Europa League. They haven’t been in the best of form recently, drawing three of their last four games, but can take some confidence in the fact that only PSG have beaten them in the last nine games. With two of their last three games being against teams above them in the league, they will need to pick up a big win to try and keep in with a chance of getting into the Europa League.
Marseille have won the last two games between the pair, with Nice winning six of the eight before that. This game may be determined by how easy or difficult a game Marseille have against Salzburg in their second leg, but I feel like Marseille will come out on top with home advantage playing a big part in that result.
Game played: Sunday 6th, 8:05 p.m. (BST) / 3:05 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Marseille win

Sporting CP v Benfica
The two top scorers in the Primeira Liga come head to head as Sporting host Benfica in a battle for the Champions league playoffs.
Sporting have been in great form this season, and have only dropped points twice at home this season. They are currently on a six game win streak in all competitions, beating Porto and Atletico Madrid in that run, so will no doubt he high on confidence coming into this game. They will no doubt be hoping to remain undefeated at home, and a win this weekend will give them a massive boost as they go into a tough last game of the season away to Maritimo, knowing they will only need a point to get into the Champions League playoffs.
Benfica have suffered two big defeats in recent weeks which has seem them drop out of the title race and into a battle simply to make the Champions League playoffs. A narrow defeat to Porto three weeks ago was followed up with a win and then a shock defeat to midtable Tondela, which has put them move level on points with third place Sporting and just three points ahead of fourth place Braga. 
These two are always very difficult to separate, with seven of the last 13 games ending in a draw, with three wins each. However, I feel like Sporting’s excellent home form and Benfica being rather shaky in recent weeks gives the hosts the advantage and I’m going with them to win.
Game played: Saturday 5th, 8:30 p.m. (BST) / 3:30 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Sporting win

It's the one we've all been waiting for.
The first major league, as hinted Wednesday, the Premier League, is available in packs as of 6 p.m. UK Friday. A Daily Knockout unlockable player item and Squad Building Challenges will follow as well.
As always, there's the no brainers: Just about everyone's player of the year, Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, experiences what N'Golo Kante did a year ago: a re-release of his POTY item, but now tradeable. YPOTY Leroy Sane of Manchester City gets the same treatment as one of the reserves. Where it gets really interesting is some items that are similar but different -- and arguably better -- in City's talisman, Kevin De Bruyne, and the keeper of MCFC's in-town rivals, Manchester United's David De Gea, who get special items with the same overall rating as their Team of the Years. We'd previously usually only seen that happen with the likes of a Lionel Messi or a Cristiano Ronaldo.
Amongst the players with a puncher's chance to break through and permeate the meta, the Manchester City duo of right back Kyle Walker and CDM Fernandinho should be firmly in the mix. Their teammate Sergio Aguero might even have a shout if you can tolerate him lacking a fifth star on both his weak foot and skill threshold. And Chelsea's Cesar Azpilicueta surely would if not for his height. Former champion Leicester City's Riyad Mahrez and Tottenham's Dele Alli look potentially special as well.
Plus, we haven't even touched on the most Sonaldo to ever Son: a whopping 92-overall Heung Min Son. 95 pace. 94 shooting. 95 dribbling. Check, please.
There are a few debatable inclusions, as is customary, but the side is pretty stout overall.
Anyone you're most looking forward to chasing and adding to your Ultimate Team? Let us know in the comments below.

In my second FIFA Mobile Pre-Season Master Player review, we have a look at Manchester United’s tricky winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan.
Unlike Fernando Torres and the CF position, Mkhitaryan and the RW spot is one that many people may already have filled with the likes of Team of the Season Lionel Messi, End of an Era Dirk Kuyt or Top Transfers Federico Bernardeschi. 
However, is it worth trading up your current RW to Mkhitaryan, if he plays anything like he does for Manchester United right now? 
Let’s take a look at him in more detail, starting with his stats: 

For people who used his 95-rated Attack Mode Master, he is roughly improved by 6 from each of those stats, with a bit extra added on to his defensive side.
He boasts an impressive 100 base pace which, when combined with his high dribbling and ball control stats, make him look like an excellent choice for the RW spot. However, he did feel quite sluggish at times when I used him. His Roulette was also very loose, which often led to him losing the ball to the keeper or defenders who were able to tackle him more easily.
His passing also looks very good on paper, with his short passing in particular standing out as a strong point. I will admit that his crossing as well was excellent for me as well some of the slightly more advanced chip passes and through balls that I made with him, but, if anything, I was having to pass with him far more than I would have liked or anticipated due to the positions he often ended up in due to his disappointing pace and somewhat poor ball control and Roulette.
My main concern with him was his shooting ‘only’ being 93 and finishing being 92. Even then, it felt far lower when I was using him, as both his curling far post efforts and powerful shots past the keeper were often off target or easily saved, which obviously is problematic with such a high-profile player.
STATS
This is the team I used him in. Due to counters, I switched between 433 and 343, mainly using the Wing Attack or Basic style to maximise his potential involvement. Having previously used the upgraded TOTS Ousmane Dembélé for a few months, I had very high hopes for Mkhitaryan, whose stats loked to be upgraded on everything Dembélé had, minus a little pace.
I played a total of 25 games across Versus Attack Mode and League vs League tournaments to get used to him and see how good he was. His stats from those games were as follows:
Goals: 44
Assists: 13
For a right winger, playing the majority of games in a Wing Attack formation, I was surprised at how little he was involved in some of the games, and that he didn’t manage to get more goals and assists than he did. When I started using him, he was only involved in 2 attacks in the entirety of the first 6 games, with my other new addition, End of an Era Frank Lampard taking up the RW role on many occasions where I would have expected Mkhitaryan to be playing.
\
REVIEW
As a Dortmund fan, my feelings towards the Armenian attacker are kind of mixed, but when I saw he was one of the 100-rated Pre-Season players and a Right Winger -- a position I needed an upgrade in -- I was always wanting to try and test him out. With his boosts of +1 Overall and +2 Ball Control to all being some of the best available, that only added to my anticipation of getting him in my team. 
Let's go into a bit more detail, starting with his pace. With a boosted 116 pace, I was expecting him to be very fast and useful for outpacing defenders who tried to tackle him. However, I quickly felt that he was fairly sluggish considering his stats. He struggled to outpace many opponents, and was often caught by some defenders who wouldn't be considered ‘elite' or ‘end-game' quality, such as the 96 Global Tour Kostas Manolas, Top Transfers Leonardo Bonucci or Team of the Year Gérard Piqué. 
Well if he's not fast, surely he can shoot and finish? Again, the answer is negative. Unlike LvL Juan Mata, whose curling shots bent more than a banana, Mkhitaryan seemed incapable of finishing anything beyond a simple finish in a 1v1 or a very slight curl round the keeper. More often than not, his shots would either go straight at the keeper or go sailing wide of the far post with indiscriminate reasoning. A large number of his goals did come from straight 1v1’s where he started centrally, and could put his excellent shot power to very good use. But that is probably the only positive I can make regarding his shooting which, for a Right Winger in particular, isn't good.
As I mentioned earlier, one part of the game where the Armenian excelled was his passing. Whether it was a short and simple pass, a long cross-field through ball or a cross from the touchline, he found his target almost every time. This did lead to a few extra goals for my team, and assists for him which helped make up for his lack of finishing.
His dribbling seemed very difficult to judge. When he was good, he was very good, being able to weave in and out of defenders in a Messi-esque fashion. In terms of close control, he was excellent one turn and then terrible the next with no way of determining which it would be beforehand. This seemed to have a knock-on effect on his Roulette, as it almost always resulted in him losing the ball due to him flicking the ball too far ahead of him. 
With him being sluggish, his strength was put to the test on many occasions. I wouldn't say he passed with flying colours, but he did win a fair share of physical battles against tough opponents such as Carniball Thiago Silva and his fellow Pre-Season players Leighton Baines and Javier Mascherano. 
SUMMARY
I know how many people who obtained his Attack Mode Master were very happy with him, but, his 100 Overall version simply isn’t worth getting in my opinion. His very limited involvement which, when combined with his fairly mediocre goals/assists return, is very poor considering the cost to make him -- including the highly demanded Rank Up token. 
His pace, dribbling and finishing are not as good as his stats may suggest. 
He often felt sluggish and struggled to get away from some of the ‘slower’ defenders such as Gerard Piqué, meaning he had very little chance against the more elite defenders that I came up against in the higher reaches of FIFA Champion. 
His shooting is incredibly inconsistent and he missed a large amount of chances that I feel like he should have scored, or one of my other players would have finished. 
Moreover, his dribbling and ball control is very inconsistent, especially considering he has 103 and 106 for those stats. I was expecting him to be one of the best players to run with, but that was far from true. His touch was sometimes very loose but then the very next attack he would be able to control it and cut past defenders with ease as if he was a different player. His Roulette often went too far ahead of him which resulted in him losing the ball to a waiting defender. 
The only fully positive attribute was his passing, which was excellent. His crossing was extremely accurate and his short passing was always on point.
However, due to the very limited amount that passing influences games, that alone is not enough to make him worth the cost of opening packs and grinding live events to try and obtain.
So, due to the limited time that the Pre-Season promo has remaining and unless you have your heart set on getting Mkhitaryan, I would highly recommend looking elsewhere for a player to upgrade to 100 Overall. The likes of the aforementioned 99-rated Dirt Kuyt, who is actually better in many stats, so getting a 99 Overall player, plus a different 100 Overall player with the +1 Overall boost to all would be far better than getting Mkhitaryan. Federico Bernardeschi, who is far easier to obtain, seems to be far more enjoyable to use in game based on what I have heard when talking to others who have him.

A few more ""Unpredictables"" than normal this week with nine players missed, but that's perhaps more down to EA's own selection choices than our predictions. As always there are big names and big confusion inside, so read on to find out who we missed from TOTW 8, and why we missed them. Lets go! 
Bertrand Traore – RW – Lyon
Aaron went for Fekir in his TOTW 8 predictions, and after two goals last week and another two this week that made a whole lot of sense. But instead EA have selected Bertrand Traore from Lyons huge 5-0 win against St. Etienne. Traore grabbed a goal and an assist for the predicted Fekir in what was Lyon’s fourth win in a row in Ligue 1.
Aaron's View: I opted for Traore's teammate, Fekir. Once again, EA felt it was too soon for a SIF, and similarly to last week, they decided to opt for the next best thing instead.
Dani Parejo – CM – Valencia
Speaking of teams inform, Valencia are absolutely flying in La Liga with their seventh straight coming last weekend at home to Leganes, who have been over achieving themselves. Danny Parejo opened the scoring on 13 minutes, and was Valencia’s all-round star man on the day to pick up his first IF of the season. 
Aaron's View: Just the one goal to his name, but with a 3-star rating from MARCA, Parejo was always a valid option. It was between him and Kevin De Bruyne, and I went for the wrong option this week.
Mats Hummels – CB – Bayern Munich
Bayern successfully navigated their most difficult away game of the season at Dortmund with a convincing 3-1 win. The goals came from Robben, Lewandowski, and Alaba, all of which could have been selected. The IF, however, is awarded to Hummels, for no other reason that he’s a very good centre half it seems. No clean sheet, no goal, no assist. Very tough to predict, but a great IF for FUT 18. 
Aaron's View: A big game between Dortmund and Munich always has IF potential, and Hummels was named MOTM. But with 0 goals, 0 assists, and no clean sheet, I think this IF is pushing it a bit.
Divock Origi – RM – Wolfsburg
Wolfsburg are on a quite incredible run of seven straight draws in the Bundesliga, the latest of which was a 3-3 thriller against Hertha Berlin. Liverpool loanee Divock Origi grabbed one goal and an assist, but just like Hummels above, this is yet another tough IF to predict from Germany this week. Single goal, single assist and only a draw, rather than a win. EA generosity is at peak levels. 
Aaron's View: I was under the impression that Origi played as a striker last weekend, which is why I didn't seriously consider him for TOTW 8.
Nenad Tomovic  - CB – Chievo Verona
Holding free-scoring Napoli to a 0-0 draw is no mean feat, and Chievo managed exactly that last week to allow Juventus the opportunity to close the gap on the Serie A leaders. Any of Chievo’s defence could have been in the IF mix this week, and Tomovic gets the nod. However goalkeeper Sorrentino can feel a little aggrieved after making five saves in this one. 
Aaron's View: Another random Serie A addition this week. Chievo shocked Napoli, holding them to a 0-0 draw. But was anyone really IF worthy from this game?
Anderson Talisca – CAM – Besiktas
Besiktas made it back-to-back wins in the Turkish Superlig with a well fought 3-1 win away at Goztepe. Predictably Brazilian schemer Anderson Talisca was at the heart of his sides attacking threat, opening the scoring on 7 minutes and then later assisting Cenk Tosun to wrap up the three points. 
Aaron's View: With there being a lot of options in midfield this week, I just couldn't justify a second Turkish league player with just a goal and an assist to his name.
Clint Dempsey – CF – Seattle Sounders
The MLS playoffs are nearing their grand finale in America, but EA’s hometown club Vancouver Whitecaps have failed at one of the final hurdles losing 2-0 to regional rivals Seattle Sounders. Clint Dempsey did the damage scoring both goals, and the Sounders now move on to play Houston Dynamo in the Western Conference Finals after the International break. 
Aaron's View: *With it being a playoff match, I was unsure whether EA would include it or not, especially with Waston being ignored a couple of weeks ago after a goal and assist from centre back. Obviously, EA decided that they do count MLS playoffs, and thus we saw Dempsey in TOTW 8. *
Gregor Balazic – CB – FC Ural
Over to Russia now where last Friday FC Ural grabbed a 2-2 draw against Dinamo Moscow, who currently occupy one of the relegation places. In an unspectacular game, centre half Balazic grabbed both his sides goals including the 90th minute equaliser. Not a bad day's work for the Slovenian defender.
Aaron's View: Two goals for a defender is usually enough to make my prediction. But with Monaco's right back getting three assists, I just couldn't see two silver (NIF) defenders making the cut; I was wrong.
Mergim Berisha – ST – LASK Linz
The most obscure IF this week comes from Austria where LASK Linz forward Mergim Berisha scored twice and assisted another in his sides 4-2 win against SCR Altach. Those were the Kosovan’s first two goals of the season. And yet another very, very, tough player to predict for TOTW 8.
Aaron's View: It's not often you see an Austrian striker make the TOTW for anything less than a hat trick, and because of that, I overlooked Berisha entirely."

Market Overview
A whirlwind of Team of the Season and World Cup mode announcements have stolen the show at the moment, and this hype has had a significant impact on the FUT market. The much anticipated market crash has begun, and although prices seem cheap now, it should only get lower when the heavy hitting leagues like the Premier League, La Liga and Calcio A drop their full TOTS sides. If you are looking to turn a pretty penny on FUT, it is during lighting rounds when you can find the best deals, so clear out those transfer piles and good luck hunting. 
On the topic of the World Cup, let’s turn our focus to the sector of the FUT market which was EA’s first WC hype promo: Path to Glory items. No sugar coating this one as it was a rough week for pretty much every PTG item, but that was to be expected considering the overall market crash. Hopefully you sold a couple weeks ago when we were stressing that, because now is a great time to start having those coins working for you. 
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats



The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:   For the past couple of weeks, this section has been focused on looking for players who have large high/low differences and also coming off negative return weeks. At the moment that is a lot of those players on the Weekly Rundown. That could be good for players looking for quick flips, but it might be smart to wait a little. Examples of the preceding trend can be seen in the likes of Timemoue Bakayoko, Saul and Thomas Lemar.

Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take: Volatility skyrocketed as the TOTS release caused the FUT market to tumble. With prices of the middle to higher rated items still set to slide during the TOTS season we are going to say the likes of Gabriel Jesus, Marcus Rashford and Gonzalo Higuain are items to avoid for now.
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Going forward, look to beta figures to give you a rough estimate to when a item’s price should be stabilizing. Their figure will be low, but that said you can still make coins on high beta figure players. At the moment a lot of those high beta figure players are high risk/high reward, but the likes of Thorgan Hazard, Alejandro Gomez and Ilkay Gudgeon look to be poised for big price shifts. 
TOTW & Upgrade Shout 
After a couple weeks of multiple Team of the Week shouts in the Path to Glory sector, we have a lonely player to highlight this week. Raheem Sterling has been playing out of his mind this year, and so three assists usually warrants a TOTW shout. The ex-Liverpool man has an interesting case though considering he also is primed for a TOTS next week.
Big Winner - Lightning Round Investors (PTG Select Players)
This week was rough for PTG items from top to bottom. Only four PTG players had positive weekly returns, and of those no item reached above 10%.  So, how can any item be a big winner? Well, the answer might be right in front of us. 
At this point, the only dynamic player items that have value will be players who are looking to feature for their national teams during the World Cup. PTG items will get upgraded depending on World Cup performances meaning there is still potential for those large hype price swings. So, it might take a little speculating, but if you can start investing in players who will most likely make their WC teams you can start investing in those when other players dump them for quick coins during lightning rounds. Make sure to be looking for players who get quality minutes too, so the likes of Sergej Milinkovic-Savic. Be patient, and look to the open bids.
Big Loser - Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Liverpool)
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was having one of the seasons of his life, and it is a shame an injury cut it short. So, although the Liverpool midfielder is our biggest loser this week, I want to shed a little positive light on the situation by examining a trend I noticed this past week. 
Although the Ox’s season is over and his upgrade potential is dashed, there is still a silver lining to his utility in FUT. His inform is already a beast, and now it seems his PTG item provided a microcosm of how one can make serious coins by flipping these cut price items during TOTS lightning rounds. 
This method requires patience and research for maximum profit, but it is simple. Find a reasonably price PTG player in a big league with desirable stats (i.e Rodrigo or Alejandro Gomez), and place open bids on all their items that have decent profit margins. You need to make sure you have a grasp for what the buy now price is on the item, but bidding on these players during lightning rounds sees you competing against less player, which means more deals. 

Recap
Overall, both the general FUT market and Path to Glory sector took a big beating this week. It had been expected, and with the heavy hitting TOTS squads still on the horizon, make sure to plan for the trend to continue downwards. Although it may seem bleak when players’ prices are crashing, but try to stay calm and remember items are getting cheaper as well. That means your buying power goes up, making market crash times the best to find deals to flip quickly.

With the World Cup mode right around the corner, which players are you looking forward to trying out the most? Could be a player not in FIFA considering EA get expanded license for the title update.

Our friend and yours, the one, the only Chu Boi returns in episode 2 of his series, ""Trust The Boi"", to offer FUT enthusiasts his insights on the best players in FIFA 18. In his latest release, Chu evaluates La Liga Santander, or what he calls, ""the most OP league in the game."" 
In his opinion, the league boasts some of the best players in the game. However, Chu believes the league suffers due to pricey forwards and player selection. His goal of the episode is to help viewers get around the league's disadvantages. 
In the video, he classifies players into three different categories by position: cheap, decent, expensive. Chu ranks individual cards using price, rating, and his own personal preference. In this latest installment, he discusses a few of the game's highest-rated stars, including Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Isco, Gareth Bale and many more.
After stating his opinion for each position, Chu compiles squads using Futhead's squad builder tool. He offers lineups that range from cheap to expensive and defensive to attacking. 
If you have struggled to make a playable and winning La Liga Santander team, check out the video above. If you are in need of English Premier League insight, make sure you check out ""Trust The Boi's"" last episode about the game's most love and overused league."

Ed. Note: WyseFIFA, who's collaborated previously with FUT Economist and built a growing following of his own, will add some market experise and analysis to what we do at Futhead. Give him a warm FH welcome.
Market Overview
What a week for Ones to Watch investing. Four players all had quality Team of the Week shouts, and many investors are sitting pretty if they sold into the hype. But besides those players, and across the FIFA Ultimate Team market, it’s a bit of a much bleaker picture. 
Players are seeing an overall decline, and this decline can be attributed to a variety of factors: mainly Black Friday fears and increased pack rewards (Squad Battles, Squad Building Challenges, and Weekend League). The preceding factors have led to an increased supply of items being sold off in panic, leading to undercutting and price drops. Yet, a silver lining of price decline is that at least items are becoming more affordable. And with an increase in affordability, it might be time to invest in some OTWs. Spending fewer coins can mean lower risk, but you can always use research on the market’s trends.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 enthusiasts have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price over the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take: Looking at the graph above, the highs and lows really reflect how the OTW market has been feeling the effects of the Ultimate Scream crash. With a lot of player hitting extreme lows (i.e. Franck Yannick Kessié, Theo Hernandez), it may be time to buy. Being close to the discard floor limits the coins you can lose. And if they get a TOTW shout, the hype will yield a nice profit, like Bertrand Traoré. 

Volatility
Volatility (or Standard Deviation) is measured in terms of coins. This statistic is a great way to evaluate the risk, and accordingly reward, of trading/investing in a player item. Generally, higher value players will have higher volatility, but in the case of OTWs, a player who warrants an upgrade can also exhibit large volatility. 
-- Quick take: Players in the elite categories like Alvaro Morata, Alexandre Lacazette, and Kylian Mbappe Lottin all have high volatility that could lead to some great quick flips. But those are few and far between. So if you’d rather trade a lot of items, maybe consider a low volatility player, such as Keita Balde Diao or longtime Futhead favorite, Bruma, as you’ll have a better idea of when you've picked up a steal.

Beta
Just like volatility, a beta is a measure of risk. However, it examines the item’s relationship to the overall market. To clarify, a negative beta does not mean the item has negative returns. Rather, beta represents the tendency of a item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: The crash is affecting pretty much all items, but if you are looking to be safe, players like Leonardo Bonucci, Gylfi Sigurdsson, and Serge Aurier seem to be a good places to park your coins (they have betas close to zero). If you think the market will rebound massively, look to the likes of Kyle Walker and Andriy Yarmolenko to be your saviour (high positive betas). 
TOTW shout
Four players had decent shots at making the TOTW this: Mbappe, James Rodriguez, Mohamed Salah, and Traore. Only three made it. If you played the OTW futures game, hopefully you chose wisely. 
In-depth daily analysis

For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner(s) -- Kylian Mbappe (PSG) & Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) 
We finally have it. Not one, but three Ones to Watch getting informs means the trends of their prices will now have a precedence. If you have paid attention to recent trends, you’ll notice that the OTW players that received informs have plummeted from their hype price before the TOTW release. So, selling into the hype is perhaps the way to go. That being said though, the players that picked up informs are still trading at prices above their pre-match value.
Let’s start with a man that was a big loser last week: Kylian Mbappe. If you picked up his item at that time, you are looking at around 70-100k profits. Yes, picking up OTW items is always a gamble, but players like the ex-Monaco man are examples of safer bets. 
For one, Keita starts most games and this means he has more chances to get that inform, which is also reflected in his modest beta (0.73). Couple that with the fact that there is a ton of hype behind this wonderkid, and you have a player whose price can shoot up drastically if he shows the slightest sign of a positive performance. The preceding point can be reflected in his matchday return 22.7% and his high volatility (~84,765). Yet, keep in mind that volatility means you are playing a high risk/high reward game that could turn into big losses. 
One big thing to note: Mbappe has consistently lineup as a RW this season, so it is logical to assume that’s where his informs will be position, but his OTW will remain at ST, making that item even more potentially valuable. 
On that topic, Mohamed Salah is a player whose inform is a ST, but his OTW will remain a right winger. Salah has been in scorching form, and if Liverpool ever shore up their defense this man is in for a plethora of special items. Looking at Salah’s weekly round-up stats, he shares that high volatility and modest beta combo seen in Mbappe. So, I will spare you the repetition. However, I want to highlight the possibility that the Egyptian will earn himself a Team of the Group Stage item (TOTGS). Another inform will solidify Salah as an elite option driving his price up even further. Keep this in mind if his price drops. 
A quick comment on both players seeing price declines on November 6 and 7th: This trend offers an interesting insight into what time of days are best to sell. The reason for the negative returns is because in the middle of the day more of their items were listed, and this competition drove down price. But, as people stop posting the items to the mark the prices crept back up overnight (less supply).          

Big Loser -- Romelu Lukaku (Manchester United)
Before this week, the “elite” tier of OTW items had been underperforming, and the decline in their prices demonstrate investors distrust. A prime example is the Manchester United forward Romelu Lukaku, and in a wide spread market crash his underwhelming performances have led his price off a cliff.  As a high coin value player his volatility is high, but over this week it has work against him as his price dropped considerably (roughly 163K). 
Another indicator of his large shift is his high positive beta of 1.18, which signifies how his item got caught up in the down turn of the market. 
Taking a step back to look at his daily returns, it is important to notice that although his price has gone up from morning to night, his price seems to take a large hit at night. By reviewing this phenomenon an investor can conclude that the demand to buy his item is rather low. Keep in mind, last week Mbappe was a big loser and look where he is now, alas could we see Lukaku in a similar position? He plays for a club in a league that could generate unprecedented hype.

Recap & outlook
To wrap it up, there were some major winners and losers this week in the OTW market. I have been beating a dead horse by saying prices are taking a hit, but I want to stress that lower prices are not always bad. Now that these items are more accessible, traders and investors should consider when their prices will go back up. It’s only the second week of November, and EA definitely have tricks up their sleeves to regulate market prices. Some final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: For smart/quick flips, look to target players in the 30-50k range whose price stays relatively stable. That’ll allow you to know when you got a good deal, while being able to flip with consistency
-- OTW investors: If you have the coins, the elite priced players are continuing to drop. Knowing when the market reaches the bottom is a golden questions, but is it time to take a high risk/high reward gamble? 
The main lesson learned from this week was sell into the hype for the best profit. As always, buy low and sell high, but look to the horizon with the uncertainty of Path to Glory & Black Friday looming.

Another fine performance from our Aaron Grimmer this week see's a repeat of six players missed from his TOTW 7 Predictions. But as always there are some big names to review and what is most likely the most undeserved IF of FIFA 18 so far ... read on and hit the comments if you agree.

Dries Mertens – ST – Napoli
With mid-week league games in scope for Serie A Dries Mertens had plenty of opportunities to get on the score sheet and he did just that in both games with 2 goals against Genoa and 1 against Sassulo in back-to-back Napoli wins. With that Napoli maintain their unbeaten start to the season with Mertens now on 10 league goals in 10 games, and quite rightly earning his second IF of FIFA 18. 
Aaron's view: I felt it was too close to Mertens first IF for him to pick up another this week and with him scoring just the one goal in the main weekend game I discounted him on that basis.
Moussa Dembele – ST – Celtic
There were mid-week games in Scotland too this week which gave players more chances to make the TOTW and Moussa Dembele duly obliged also by scoring twice in Celtic’s 3-0 win against title rivals Aberdeen. However, Celtic followed that impressive win with a 1-1 draw at Kilmarnock which allowed Aberdeen to claw back some of the lost ground. All the same, Dembele is looking like a great ST option if you’re building on a budget. 
Aaron's View: To be honest, I was put off Dembele purely because the majority of his goal scoring efforts for Celtic came in the midweek game in Scotland.
Ashley Young – LWB – Manchester Utd
Whilst Ashley Young’s transition to wing back extraordinaire began under Louis Van Gaal, his adaptation has surged further forwards under Mourinho this season. Against Spurs Young was excellent at thwarting Spurs wing backs with 100% tackle success and 6 clearances. This would have been a tough prediction though with the IF coming more from accumulated good form rather than a single standout game. 
Aaron's View: For me, this is a bit of a random one. United recorded a big win against Spurs but with no stand out performances it was tough to pick anyone. I half expected either Jones or Martial, but Young?
Rafael Toloi – CB – Atalanta
A very mixed week in Serie A for Atalanta who despatched strugglers Verona 3-0, only to then lose 2-1 at Udinese four days later. And because of that, this is another tough IF to predict with Toloi grabbing a clean sheet against Verona and an assist in the loss to Udinese. Sometimes Aaron genuinely misses things and that’s fine, but sometimes he’s given no chance what so ever. A very odd pick from EA I must say in a week where there are multiple better options. The most undeserved IF so far? 
Aaron's View: Another game from midweek and with no goals and no assists in Toloi's first game followed by a loss in his second, I never considered him an option.
Marcal – LB – Lyon
Lyon made it three wins on the spin this weekend in Ligue 1 to keep pace with leaders PSG and Monaco. Whilst Fekir grabbed the headline for his brace, Marcal makes the cut for his clean sheet and assist. Again, not the most obvious of picks from EA but that said Marcal did also grab an assist last week in Lyon’s 5-0 win over Troyes, so again its accumulation of good form helping out the full-backs this week. 
Aaron's View:  Fekir was the obvious choice but being too close to his first IF it looks like EA went for the next best thing. Difficult to justify from a predicting point of view, but with two strong performances in a row, probably a worthy pick.
Kenny Miller – CF – Rangers
After a reasonably disappointing start to the SPL Rangers now seem to have got going and are subsequently unbeaten in four matches. That run included their 3-1 over Hearts in which Kenny Miller scored two of the three goals and assisted another. And he certainly needed it as they were his first goals of the season for Rangers. He’s 37 now, but Miller still knows where the onion sack is in Scotland.
Aaron's View: Two goals and an assist for Miller makes him the most obvious of the players I missed this week. I simply opted for different players; sorry, Kenny."

Your patience has been rewarded. After a week off, the FUT Weekly Podcast returns, with a guest packed look at professional FIFA and the upcoming Team of the Season promotion. 
Paris Saint Germain's USA-based pro FIFA player Gordon ""Fiddle"" Thornsberry hops on with Ben and co. to discuss the big FUT Champions Manchester Cup: What went right? Why was it so much more successful than its Barcelona predecessor? Which tactics and strategies can regular players take away from the pro scene?

A solid score of three out of five last week will hopefully put us in good stead going forward as we head towards the end of the season in Europe’s main leagues. 
This week we are back to four games again, with the Calcio B debuting in Matchups for the first time, along with a crunch game in the Bundesliga, a potential title decider in Calcio A and a promotion playoff clash in the English Championship.
So, let’s get into the games.

Leipzig v Hoffenheim
We start off in Germany in a very important game. Leipzig and Hoffenheim currently sit fifth and sixth in the table, just four and five points behind the last two Champions League spots respectively. 
They may not have been able to eclipse their form from last season, but Leipzig look to have established themselves as a strong Bundesliga team in their first two seasons in the Bundesliga. Leipzig have suffered a bit of a stutter in form recently with five losses and four draws in their last 13. With two wins in Europe and one against Bayern in those games, they have managed a few positive results in that time. At home this season they have been tough to beat, with only Leverkusen, Hertha and Koln able to take three points from them.
Hoffenheim are unbeaten in their last seven, with their four wins in that run all being with a clean sheets. With Serge Gnabry in flying form scoring six in his last six games, the on-loan Bayern attacker has made a late claim for a spot in Germany’s World Cup squad. Hoffenheim’s away form has not been too good this season, managing to pick up just 15 points from 15 games on the road. However, with Julian Nagelsmann at the helm, nothing seems a step too far for the side who were threatened by relegation just a few years ago.
These two are split down the middle in head to head, with each coming out victorious on one occasion and drawing the other time. The reverse fixture earlier this season saw a Gnabry masterclass lead the hosts to a 4-0 rout, but I feel like this one will be a lot closer. Home and away form over the course of the season would suggest the hosts should win comfortably, but recent form makes the visitors look favourites.
This is a tough one to call, with both teams having reasons to back them. As a result, I’m going with a draw in this one as it seems too close to call, but I feel like if one team was going to win then I’d go for Hoffenheim, as their superior form may give them the edge.
Game played: Saturday 21st, 2:30 p.m. (BST) / 9:30 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw

Juventus v Napoli
Next we head to Italy for an all important top of the table clash. Juventus have been dominant force in Italy for a number of years, while Napoli seem to have established themselves as the ‘best of the rest’ and the only ones who seem capable of challenging Juve in the league. A win for Juventus will put them seven points clear with just four games to play, while a win for Napoli will close the gap to just one point, and they’ll hope that Juventus drop points in one of their last few games against some of the better teams in the league.
The hosts have been in incredible form all season, dropping five points at home and only conceding 5 in their 16 home games. They have dropped points just twice since January, with that being a shock 0-0 draw against relegation threatened Spal just over a month ago, and then another surprising draw against Spal's relegation rivals Crotone on Wednesday night. Their agonising last minute loss in the Champions League quarter final may still be fresh in some fans memories, but there is no doubting that everyone playing will be pumped up and prepared for the game.
After being top of the league for so long, Napoli now find themselves six points behind their opponents. A dismal run of two wins in six isn't acceptable for any team with title ambitions, especially this late in the season, and it may prove to be what costs them the title. But with players like FIFA Mobile Season 1 favourite Dries Mertens on their roster, anything is possible. They have conceded just 8 goals on the road this season which is a league best, and only Juventus and Lazio have outscored them, proving they are a tough team to face wherever they play.
When these two play it's always a close encounter, and you have to go back to 2013 for the last time a team has won by more than two goals. The home team has won six of the last eight ties between these two, with Juventus winning all four of their home games in that run. On top of that, Napoli have only won once when playing away to Juventus in the league, but they will no doubt be hoping to double their win tally.
Juventus are big favourites for this game according to the bookies, and I feel like they will come out on top due to home advantage and their form this year just being so good.
Game played: Sunday 22nd, 7:45 p.m. (BST) / 2:45 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Juventus win

Foggia v Bari
Our second game in Italy comes from the Calcio B in a clash between two teams fighting for a place in the promotion playoffs. Although I admit that I know very little about the league, trying to predict these sort of games is often more down to luck and statistics than knowledge.
Foggia currently sit two points off the playoff places in ninth and are looking for their second promotion in a row, having only been promoted from the third division last season. At home this season they are one of the worst teams in the league, picking up just 23 points from 18 games. They can take hope in the fact that Fabio Mazzeo is having one of the best seasons of his career, and has found a good run of form at the perfect time of the season.
Bari have been in decent form as well with only one loss in their last 12 games, but drawing six of those games. They have not been in the best of form on their travels this season, picking up just 21 points from a possible 54 on the road. They will be hoping to get back to winning ways after a run of three consecutive draws, as three of their last five games are against teams above them in the table, so they will need to pick up as many points as possible to keep their playoff place safe.
These two have only met twice before with both games being played with Bari at home, and each team being victorious on one occasion. With Foggia being in good form, particularly Mazzeo, I think that they are in with a good chance of winning this game.
Game played: Saturday 21st, 2:00 p.m. (BST) / 9:00 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Foggia win

Derby v Middlesbrough
Lastly we head to England for a crunch match which may decide the last of the playoff places. With just three games left, seven teams could still make it into the last two playoff spots, and this game could be crucial in deciding who makes it comes the end of the season.
Derby sit just one point outside the playoff places, and face three teams who are all fighting for promotion in their last four games. The first of those tough games is against fifth place Middlesbrough, who are just one point ahead of them. Derby have been in pretty awful form of late, with just two wins in twelve and having lost more games than they have won since the new year. However, they will be hoping that Matej Vydra, the top scorer in the league, will be able to carry them to an important three points. However, losses against Burton and Sunderland, the two teams at the bottom of the league, in their past five games shows just how bad their form is.
Middlesbrough sit at the top of group of teams at the foot of the promotion playoff places, and will be hoping to get promoted back to the Premier League at the first time of asking. They have been in good form with six wins in their last 11 games, and only losing to league champions Wolves and fellow promotion chasers Sheffield United. However away from home they haven’t been quite as good, winning only once in their last seven games and only being able to score more than one on one occasion.
Games between these two have been very tough to call in the past, with both teams having won both at home and away in the past few years. Middlesbrough are in slightly better form, but with Derby at home, it evens things out slightly. A draw wouldn’t be a surprising result, but I feel like Middlesbrough’s form will help them get a valuable three points as they push from promotion.
Game played: Saturday 21st, 3:00 p.m. (BST) / 10:00 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Middlesbrough win

That’s what I think might happen this week, with good mix of games to try and predict this week. As a reward, you can pick yourself up one of two players, with an 85 Overall ST Serge Gnabry and 85 Overall CB Dayot Upamecano, or some ever important Skill Boosts to help you boost your team.
As always, good luck and happy predicting!"

As far as officially licensed sports videogames go, the FIFA series is without doubt one of the most comprehensive and decorated on the market. And to EA's credit, it's certainly no mean feat to piece together when every single league, confederation and governing body hold the rights to their own intellectual property. And yet, as good as FIFA is at giving its players a layer of authenticity, the crown jewel of the club football world has for a long time eluded the series.

Those of you with your ear to the ground though will already be aware of Konami ending their 10-year relationship with UEFA which was officially announced last week. That deal, whilst active, gave the PES series licensed access to the Europa League, and Champions League and it will all come to an end after this year’s final takes place in Kyiv on the 26th May. 
The obvious caveat with this article is that we still have no official announcement from EA or UEFA with regards to where that license is going (if anywhere), but given the response of Konami reps on social media, and plain old common sense, it seems more than likely that FIFA will inherit the license and be able to use the brand in FIFA 19 and beyond. As a fan, I certainly hope so anyway. 
So, what would this mean for FIFA, and more importantly what can EA learn from how PES used the license whilst it was under their control? 
Those of you that have played PES will know that Konami’s use of the Champions League license was fairly minimal, but where they did use it, they did so incredibly well. It was of course baked in to Master League if your team were involved in European matches, and there was a standalone Tournament mode too should you wish to play through the competition mirroring real life. The menus were all beautifully branded, the iconic music played as you started each mode. And in-game, there was the usual assortment of visuals you’d expect to see in and around the pitch on a Champions League night. 
However, that was pretty much as far as it went in terms of integration and over the ten years they had the rights to UEFA's premier club competitions, I don't think it's unfair to suggest they could have done more with it. It's a sentiment shared by quite a few people in the PES community, who will now be looking towards a very different PES 19 as we move towards E3 in June.

One thing you can be sure of is that if EA do indeed land the license they will not be slow out of the blocks and will likely throw all their power and scale behind marketing their latest licensed superstar on social media and beyond. For all their faults, EA are really good at this stuf,f and I expect an absolute fanfare from them if/when the big reveal comes. 
But what about FIFA's modes themselves? There are of course some obvious quick wins as far as Ultimate Team goes, with Champions and Europa League in-forms almost a certainty, and maybe even whole Teams of the Game week too? You can also bet your bottom dollar on Champions League tournaments, kits, balls and a host of other ancillary additions. But the big proving ground for how well EA utilise the license (if they get it) will be FUT Champions, which has a natural tie in in its name, and therefore the potential to be huge for the FIFA 19 eSports scene depending on what EA can conjure up. 
Perhaps the biggest beneficiary of any new licensing deal involving the Champions League will be Career Mode, which has suffered unbranded European football competitions for the last 10 years. European matches as a result, just don't feel special particularly when your're moving from the freshly branded BPL, La Liga or Bundesliga experience you had in your league games. The fake Champions Cup stands out like a sore thumb in Career Mode, and regardless of what new things EA add to its management simulation this year, the mode improves almost instantly with these license aquisitions. 
The biggest win for every mode in FIFA will come however with what EA do with the 'potential' UEFA licensing on the pitch, because we all know how special those European nights can be in terms of atmosphere, grandeur and magnitude. Even though EA have done a fantastic job of recreating life in the Premier League and others, this is a big step up for them undoubtedly. Once the Champions League anthem begins, it needs to send chills down the spine as the crowd noise rises (the Man City fans boo) and the players begin their pre-match rituals. EA have the resources and the experience to deliver a big match-day experience we know that, but for European football and I hope they go all-out to make it feel like a FIFA we've never seen or heard before. 
One big step towards recreating that famous European football atmosphere would be if EA can land a chunk of new stadiums to go with the license. EA have had the teams under their banner for years, but it’s these famous European venues that make Champions League nights what they are. We've of course had Anfield and Old Trafford in FIFA for a long time but what about Celtic Park, the Estadio da Luz, or the Turk Telekom? What better opportunity for EA to get some more big iconic stadiums in FIFA than now with the power of UEFA behind them?

I’ve attempted to caveat it throughout this piece, as there’s still no confirmation on the record that this will even happen, but as a fan of football and FIFA, I can’t help but be excited at the prospect of taking my Career Mode and FUT teams in to the Champions League proper. I know people will tell you the license doesn’t matter, and that they can edit things, or rename them themselves but it just does. There’s something truly magical about those famous stars, the anthem and the competition as a whole. It’s football gold dust, and if EA do indeed have control of the license, FIFA 19 is well and truly setup for success."

Here is a fun little mental exercise for the end of the season. The object is to build the best team using just one card from FIFA Mobile 2017, cloned 25 times and put in each outfield position. So that means you need a player who will be the best striker, midfielder, and defender, all in one card. We’ll ignore goalies for now.
Another quick note: while many of these players are truly versatile, they're not all even best at their own positions. The way FIFA Mobile is set up, with attacking and defending happening seperately, a uni-tasking specialist is often better than a generalist in many positions.

Let’s Ignore Boosts
Boosts make this too clear cut, so let’s ignore them. A roster of all pre-season Hazards would be the obvious choice because of his +3 OVR boost. Even though Hazzy is a bit weak in the defence department, the boosts would give him a more than respectable 127 marking and 129 tackling. Combined with an insane 183 sprint and acceleration he’d be the best defender in the game. More crushing would be his offensive game, with a positively ludicrous finishing of 261 (each Hazard would boost the finishing of each other Hazard by 6 — 3 from his finishing boost, and 3 from the OVR boost, which boosts all stats). Oh, and the team would have roughly a 181 OVR. This makes it too obvious a choice, so let’s just ignore boosts completely.
Below are my top choices. I haven’t played with all of them, so we're going to focus on stats. Since we can’t actually do this in game, there is some guesswork involved.

6. Team McAllister
Little-known Grimsby Town midfielder Sean McAllister caused some head-scratching when he was selected as a golden egg player back in the Easter program. He is, however, an exceptionally well balanced player with a 90 attacker rating, 99 creator rating, and a 98 defender rating.
Out of every single card in FIFA Mobile, he has the most total aggregate stats. Not Messi, Ronaldo, Kanté, or any of the 100-rated pre season players. McAllister is number one in the whole game, making him a great balanced option.
His pace of 93 is a little on the low side though, making him a little too sluggish to build a whole team on.

5. Team Keïta
By pure stats alone, it’s hard to find a player even in the same ballpark as Keïta. Adding up all stats, Keïta is the second highest ranked card in the entirety of FIFA mobile, despite being just a 96 OVR. His 110 pace, 100 finishing, and 97 tackling would all make him a superb choice.
The main thing not working in Keïta’s favour is his OVR. A team composed of Keïtas would have a 3–4 OVR disadvantage compared to these other teams. That’s enough for him to drop a few spots in the rankings, despite having arguably superior stats.
If Keïta ever received a 99 or 100 rated card, he would probably take the top spot in this ranking. He’s just simply a beast of a card, and even with his lower rating he would probably give some of these higher ranked teams a run for their money.

4. Team Kanté
They already call him the Kanté twins, why not go a bit further and make 25 more of him?
While not boasting the incredible stats of Keïta, TOTS Kanté is a pretty complete package. Free kicks and heading are weaknesses, but other than that he has great pace, great defending, and attacking skills which could be classified as “not bad”.
N’Golo has the single best tackling and stamina of any card in the game, and is near the top for aggression. Playing against 10 Kantés would be terrifying, giving a psychological edge to his team.

3. Team Srna
Darijo Srna is fast, can attack and defend, and his 100 overall rating would help. Some other high rated wingbacks have terrible shooting (cough Carvajal cough), but Srna is totally solid there.
The only real weakness with Srna is his small size and 85 heading, making team Srna a bit vulnerable in the air and on defence. Still, he’d make a wonderful choice. Team Srna would be right up there.

2. Team Nainggolan
Srna and Nainggolan are neck and neck, but I give a slight edge to the Belgian midfielder. His attack and speed are good, and he’s a solid defender too. His pace is slightly better than Srna, with better acceleration (which I personally prefer over sprint speed). He’s got slightly worse passing stats, but he’s better at both attacking and defending.
Radja’s worst stats, free kicks and heading, are amazingly still 95. That is truly remarkable. For comparison, Kante’s worse stat, free kicks, is 72. Nainggolan is literally good at everything.
While Nainggolan excels in all stats, he is on the small side. A wall of Nainggolans wouldn’t be terribly imposing, and air battles could be an issue despite his strong heading abilities.

1. Team Pogba
Pogba has all around great stats, with his lowest being marking at 88. He’s a tad low on pace and defending stats compared to some of these teams, but what he really brings is a unique combination of physicality and skill.
The pure stats for Pogba are fantastic, but the thing that makes him special is the unique way they combine. He has third highest strength in the game, but also top-class dribbling and ball control, with pretty good pace. This combination makes it extremely hard to knock him off the ball, and makes him perhaps the best pure ball carrier out there. He really shines in shot power too, in which he is second best in all of FIFA Mobile. For those of us who use a lot of power shots, this makes him a strong scoring threat whenever he has the ball.
His skill move is rainbow, but his height and dribbling skill make his rainbow one of the best in the game. His dribbling and ball control make his cuts and jukes so tight and quick he usually doesn’t need to use a skill move at all.
Pogba and Nainggolan are so close, it’s hard to pick one over the other. In the end though, I’ll give it to Pogba for the unique combination of attributes he brings to the game.
Honourable Mentions
99 Dirk Kuyt
99 Sergio Ramos
98 Arturo Vidal 
100 David Luiz
99 Eric Bailly (for pure terror and chaos)

Market Overview
With a solid TOTW and decent Icons, this week was highlighted by the Ratings Refresh promo. Overall, the FUT market has been slowly creeping back up, but look for a jump in supply of special items held as Winter upgrade investments.
Turning to the Ones to Watch market, prices were a little more interesting. It seems the Winter items are still finding their prices, while the Summer items took a dip. However, looking at general OTW trends, buying items and selling them when a player is announced in the starting lineup is still a profitable method, yet as seasons end this profit dwindles. So, how can you be smart with your coins in this market? Well keep reading to find out more.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats



The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data that I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:   This week it seems the Summer OTW items had larger high/low differences than their Winter counterparts, but that can be chalked up to some big TOTW shouts last week. After hype dies down, high and low spreads are great indicators of where a player’s price can go, so the likes of Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Douglas Costa and Diego Costa are items that could explode! 
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take:  This week two Bayern boys stand out when it comes to volatility. Corentin Tolisso and James Rodriguez both had modest return, but rather large volatility figures compared to previous weeks. This demonstrates that in a good state they have serious risk/reward potential. So, if they can slot into your midfield they might be worth a look.
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Some noticeably high figures this week belong to Serge Aurier, Joao Mario and Gylfi Sigurdsson. As usual, this dictates a high risk/high reward item, but it's interesting this week since the preceding players are on the lower end of the OTW price spectrum. Could be profitable to pick a couple up on open bid? 
TOTW Shout
Another week with a few TOTW shouts! That's great for the OTW market because people are making money, which keeps people coming back. This week it was Bertrand Traore and Francis Coquelin generating big hype, while Romelu Lukaku has a MOTM shout. 
Unfortunately, Traore and Coquelin narrowly missed out, but lets hope for more hype this weekend. 
In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner - Romelu Lukaku (Manchester United) 
Not the prettiest brace the Belgian has scored, yet any goal will give United fans hope for the big lad. With that FA Cup double, Romelu Lukaku slotted himself into a good position to receive a Man of the Match item (which will upgrade his OTW), and become this week's biggest winner!
We had been ragging on Lukaku for a couple weeks, but its hard not to when he fell from 600k to around 300k. This week changed all that considering a 25.6% return final gave investors something to cheer about. Digging into the other stats a high volatility (~27,00) and high beta (-0.75) point to this item keeping its price around 400k if he can get the upgrade.
If these two goals can help Lukaku’s confidence going forward he could be a real cash cow after a couple upgrades. But, is there enough time in the season for that?

Big Loser - Aymeric Laporte (Manchester City) 
Another week where this decision was tough considering a variety of negative returns. Some big weekly lossess can be attributed to previous TOTW shouts that missed out, meaning they can be ignored. That leaves Aymeric Laporte as our biggest loser with his -26% return.
Yes, we have been mentioning Winter OTW are still finding their prices; however, Laporte situation is interesting. His volatility and beta figures were both middle of the road meaning a holistic review is important here. Taking a step back, a big reason for his decrease could be the realization that his low pace is unattractive to many FUT players, leading to stagnation on the demand for his item. Although its not that low, people might be looking a little short sighted here considering he has a lot of chances to notch an upgrade which will elevate that pace, and price.
Although Laporte was our biggest loser, he isn’t down for the count. A lot of fixtures left for him and Man City, so don’t rule him out yet.
Recap & outlook
Over the course of the week, the general FUT market had been pretty quiet. Winter Ones to Watch items are still settling on prices, but otherwise players with Rating Refresh upgrade potential held firm. Going forward, there are still plenty of fixtures, so these items definitely have value; however, something to consider is trying to focus on players still in multiple competitions. More games equals more chances for hype, which equates to profit. Rounding off the week with a couple quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Lots of volatility amongst the OTW items as they settle from the promo, so stick to the Summer items for the moment. Winter items could be very profitable in the coming weeks.    

-- OTW investors: At this point, post-Rating Refresh, the next big OTW event will be Team of the Knockout Stage (TOTKS) so look to those players killing it in Champions and Europa League.

After a less than sparkling prediction last week, we right back in form ourselves with just six players missed from TOTW 23's contingent. The big name of the bunch is Alex Sandro who looks like an incredible pick-up this week if your pack luck is in. (Hint: It's never in)
Alex Sandro – LW – Juventus
You wouldn’t think Juventus’ slender 1-0 win against Torino would’ve been a happy hunting ground for TOTW IF’s but here we are with our biggest name amongst this week’s Unpredictables. As you’ve probably guessed Alex Sandro scored that single goal and the IF likely comes because of it being his first game of the season deployed in an attacking left-wing role. 
Aarons View: Had Sandro played in his usual LB role, I wouldn’t have hesitated to include him this week. But a singular goal from LW was not enough for me. That being said, I did mention the lack of Calcio options in my prediction, which may have helped him.
Matthijs De Ligt – CB – Ajax
Ajax closed the gap on table topping PSV who could only manage a 2-2 draw against Heerenveen in the Eredivisie on Saturday. Ajax secured themselves three points with a tight 1-0 win against PEC Zwolle where Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored taking his league tally to 10 for the season. The IF however, goes to young centre back De Ligt who claimed the clean sheet and made 12 clearances. Again, perhaps another generous IF but you certainly can’t deny this young defenders talent.
Aaron's View: 0 goals, 0 assists and an average match rating for a SIF. Definitely one of the harder ones to predict this week.
Andre Pierre Gignac – ST – Tigres
It’s fair to say that Tigres have made a mediocre start to the Liga MX season, but after 8 games they they did manage a comfortable 2-0 win last weekend against Atlas. Both of those goals came from French FUT legend Andre Pierre Gignac who despite his sides shaky start has managed 5 goals in 8 games. I have some great memories with this guy in previous FIFA's. 
Aaron's View: Two goals for Gignac, but with another Liga MX striker already in the side, I didn’t feel that two would make it; turns out they did.
Breel Embolo – ST – Schalke
A very low scoring week generally in the Bundesliga left the door open for some random IF’s and as a result we’ve got one here in the form of Swiss wonderkid Breel Embolo who score one in Schalke’s 2-1 win against Hoffenheim. Embolo has struggled with game time this season and the strike for his IF was only his second in all competitions. In any other TOTW, we wouldn’t be seeing him that’s for sure. 
Aarons' View: Embolo makes it in for a singular goal from ST. Very difficult to predict, but with a lack of Bundesliga gold options, it was either him or Sane and I went for the wrong one.
Sean Morrison – CB – Cardiff
Three straights wins for Cardiff has propelled them to second in the Championship where they are now nine points behind the leaders Wolves, who've drawn their last two. One of those wins came last Saturday where Cardiff beat Middlesbrough thanks to a powerful header from Sean Morrison in the first half. Clean sheet, goal, three points = TOTW. 
Aaron's View: Cardiff are climbing the table and now sit in second which I presume has helped Morrison pick up his IF. With two English lower league defenders with two goals missing out, I feel as though Morrison shouldn’t have been selected this week.
Cedric Itten – ST – St Gallen
And finally, we head over to the Swiss Super League where mid tablers FC St Gallen took on the mighty Basel away from home. But deterred by the size of the task they were not, running out 2-0 winners with two second half strikes from Ceric Itten to grabb all three points. Two goals in a “giant killing” always puts you in with a shout of a TOTW spot. 
Aaron's View: Another week, another poor Basel performance. Itten thrives from it this time scoring both goals in a 2-0 win. I opted for Germany’s POTW of which I felt was a stronger candidate. That being said, Itten is still a fair selection."

Though it's historically been part of a different update taking place as late as spring, the EA FIFA 18 live team are adding Skill Move and Weak Foot upgrades to the mix as part of their Winter ""Ratings Refresh"" for FUT.
Unlike ratings tweaks, skill move and weak foot changes dynamically impact all items for that player, old, special, new, and forthcoming. E.g. if you have a NIF PSV Jurgen Locadia already in your club, at some point on Friday, 23 February, his skill moves will automatically upgrade from two-stars to three-stars.
You can check out all the inbound weak foot and/or skill move tweaks and changes below. We'll add them to the Futhead database as we're able and/or they go live:

The moment's finally arrived.
While the ""BUT THE COVER STAR WASN'T IN THE GAME FOR THE PREVIOUS SIX MONTHS"" memes are pretty silly considering the 94 and 90-rated versions and a five-match loan version of the 96 were available from launch, our long collective hopes and dreams of getting our hands on the man, the myth, the legend, Prime Ronaldo ""R9"" Nazario can finally become a reality. Unsurprisingly, it'll about take a kidney to make it happen, though.
He's joined by FUT standard bearer Ruud Gullit as well as Paolo Maldini in the most star-powered Throwback Thursday Squad Building Challenges yet in honor of FUT Birthday. The trio are also available in packs as tradeable versions for the rest of this FIFA.
Needing five Icons, you can get your hands on an untradeable SBC unlockable version of the Brazilian legend, Ronaldo. For ~100K, you can also get a 20-match loan version.
It's also pretty expensive, but the untradeable SBC for 93 Gullit might be a less costly alternative for some who saved up but not quite enough hoping for Ronaldo. His loan version is also more in line with our previous expectations for these.
Finally, if you loved his lower rated items, 94 Maldini, the highest overall rated Icon centerback, is at long last in the game as well. You can complete his SBC, but it's also steep. The loan version will get you through half a Weekend League if nothing else.
Now we wait and see what the rest of the second FUT Birthday weekend has in store."

Late Friday night/early Saturday can mean only one thing: Man of the Match items.
With most leagues on international breaks currently, the past several weeks of domestic cup action get the nod, with the orange-and-blue special player items we've seen replaced by vintage orange ones.
Amongst the honorees in this Friday evening's batch are Spurs' Christian Eriksen, who although he was more of an LCAM, gets an LM item that should differentiate itself from the Tottenham star's TOTS and other best possible items this FIFA. And while he already has a Team of the Year, Chelsea's N'Golo Kante gets an orange-on-orange 89 CDM for his domination in the midfield in helping CFC progress in the FA Cup.
You can find the full alotment of new MOTM items in Futhead's latest FIFA 18 players section as well as below:

89 CDM N'Golo Kante

81 CM Pierre Emile Hojbjerg

With FIFA hardcores not shy about sharing their frustrations about the lack of evolution in FUT 18 lately, many in the community seem to be holding out hope that a 2018 World Cup DLC (or perhaps even stand alone game) can re-invigorate interest in the title and save what, while financially successful, has been a bit of a lost release for the more partisan crowd.
To break down what might be on the way, a possible timeline, and all things Ultimate Team from the vantage of a former EA staff member and contributor, friend of Futhead streamer/esports host extraordinaire Chu ""Chu Boi"" Morah joins FUT Weekly's Ben and fellow Futhead contributor (and podcast staple) Jamey, aka ""FUT Economist"". The trio dish on the future of FIFA 18, the franchise, some real behind-the-scenes talk, and plenty more.

Market Overview
The free falling FUT market finally seemed to find its ground this week as FUT Birthday nears its end. EA also delivered with some big time Icons, that have stabilized the higher rated items (both special and regular). Unfortunately, no new League SBCs, but make sure to sell on your 82-85 items soon as once these extensive FUT B-Day promotions end, their prices will plummet. 
Focusing in on the Ones to Watch sector, the overall market decline has spilled over as most players are in the red. A difficult week is not a knock against these items, it’s just how the cookie crumbled during this crash. However, with domestic seasons drawing to an end, this area of the market gets a little more difficult to navigate. So, keep reading to help yourself stay savvy as Team of the Season looms.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats



The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data that I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:   Mostly “Lows” this week, but that can be good for investing! Make sure to stick to high hype potential players in the coming weeks like Deulofeu, Theo Walcott ad if you have the budget maybe Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. 

Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take:  Big fluctuations scare most players, yet it is an area where there can be great profit. Looking at the Weekly Rundowns, players whose volatility stand out are Kylian Mbappe, Joao Mario and Kyle Walker, all represent better risk/reward options.
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: One will notice that beta figures are pretty tame considering most players followed the market down. Trying to find some positives, Andriy Yarmolenko, Virgil Van Dijk and Diego Costa could be poised for price rebounds as the market climbs up from its crash. 

TOTW Shout
A pair of BPL attackers lead the charge for the Ones to Watch items this week, as Cenk Tosun  and Mohamed Salah were both able to pick up informs this past week. Tosun did it with a brace, while Salah smashed in four goals further solidifying his amazing season!
In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner - Cenk Tosun (Everton)
In a week with only a handful of positive returns, this Everton striker blew everyone out of the water with a 198% weekly return. A number of that magnitude can’t be ignored, making Cenk Tosun this week’s biggest winner. 
Now, Team of the Week hype is a trend we’ve covered before; however, with domestic seasons coming to an end we wanted to touch on the Turkish forward’s particular case. Going forward, it may be difficult for OTW items to hold their value; however, as long as there are games left, hype can happen at any moment. Thus, we want to remind people to take the profit when they can! 
A lot of items are at really low prices, meaning lower risk on some solid hype potential cards, so if you do get in now make sure to sell as soon as any hype is drummed up, goals and assists usually do this.
Big Loser - Alexis Sanchez (Manchester United)
Although it has been a couple weeks since Manchester United suffered their Champions League defeat, we’re opening up another wound by declaring Alexis Sanchez this week’s biggest loser. Tough returns mark this item, but is there hope for the Chilean?
Sanchez presents an interesting case study for OTW items at this point in FUT. There is undeniable hype potential, and if he can pick up a couple goals expect his price to skyrocket. But, it needs to be said that there is a huge risk with this caliber of player. As we’ve seen, his price took a tumble during this past market crash, and don’t expect it to go back up organically.
This is definitely an item to sell whenever profit presents itself, but at the same time if we have any high risk investors this is the type of player for you! 
Recap & outlook
Over the previous week, one of the worst market crashes ever rocked the FUT market. Hopefully you did not get too caught up in the panic, because those with a cool head can see the opportunity when prices free fall. The Ones to Watch items were not immune from these price declines, but with many of them at near discard price it might be a good call to pick up a couple on open bid and flip whenever you break even!  Some final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Currently a buyer’s market, it seems the shift to seller’s market is just around the corner. So, be patient on open bids and look to the overnight periods for the best profit margin.     

-- OTW investors: Take profit when you can get it! 
Which OTW items do you feel have the best shout at a Team of the Season? We’d love to hear your answer below, and also,  if you can’t get enough market analysis check out our latest Path to Glory update.

Today, to mix things up, we'll be looking back at one of the bargain beasts of FIFA 17, the 90-rated TOTS Omar Al Soma.

The Syrian striker, who plays for Al Ahli in the Abdul Latif Jameel League in Saudi Arabia, has amassed two informs (an 82 and an 84), an 85-rated League SBC item, and finally, this TOTS item.
It's fair to say that Al Soma is one of the most unique players in the game, with almost paradoxical stats. He's 6'3 (192 cm), with 96 strength, 87 jumping and 99 heading accuracy, but also has four-star skills and 90 agility, 90 balance, 92 ball-control and 88 dribbling. You could say he's pretty much a cheaper (but not necessarily worse) version of TOTS Zlatan Ibrahimovic, because he has the shooting stats to back it up -- 93 finishing, 99 shot power, 96 long shots, 95 penalties, 91 freekicks and the all important four-star weak foot.

His in-game ratings are no joke either. On Basic chemistry style, he becomes a 95-rated striker and 93-rated CAM. With Hawk chemistry style (which is what I used), he is a 95-rated striker.
Stats
Here are my stats with Al Soma:
Price: 34,000 coins (he's around 45-55K now)
Games: 10
Goals: 12
Assists: 4
Chemistry Style: Hawk
Squad
I used Al Soma in this squad: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7118237/

I've also used his 85-rated item for 30-40 games, so I have a good amount of experience using Al Soma's items.
Let's take a look at some of this TOTS item's pros and cons.
Pros
Shooting: His shooting is unreal. His shot power, his finishing, his long shots, his finesses, his volleys, his chips, his driven shots, his penalties, his free kicks -- all perfect. Get him within scoring range, pull the trigger, and watch it fly in. There really isn't much else to say -- he can score any type of shot, from any angle, with either foot. Perfection.
Passing: You want your strikers to be involved in the play, and able to create opportunities for others. Al Soma can do just that -- his range of passing is awesome, and the way he can hold up the ball, and then perfectly distribute it, is ridiculous. He is wonderful as helping retain possession, and can easily drop back and act as a midfielder.
Physicality: As mentioned, he's tall with 96 strength and 87 jumping. As a result, he has an incredible physical presence on the field -- he wins everything in the air, he bullies almost every opponent, and he challenges for every 50-50 duel. This means you can use him as the conventional target man, and he can function perfectly in that role.
Dribbling: His dribbling is incredible in game, and feels higher than the 90-rating. He feels agile and quick on the ball, his balance is fantastic, and his ball-control, dribbling and first touch are perfect. He also has those four-star skills, which makes him a nightmare to stop.
Pace: He's by no means slow. He feels rapid in game -- sure, he'll get caught by the faster defenders and midfielders, but he can easily get away from the average centerback or defensive mid.
Cons
Chemistry: Let's get the biggest one out of the way -- he's incredibly difficult to link up. The only really options you have are a full Saudi league team (which isn't really competitive), to surround him with legends (which is expensive, and not possible on PC or PS), or use one of the players he gets a strong link too (Ioannis Fetfatzidis was average at best, and the silver TOTS items are very expensive). One option would be to get him on 8 chem (you can link him and TOTS Kahraba up for a deadly 8-chemistry partnership), or sub him on at the start of the game (where he would get the default 5 chemistry, which still gives him his incredible base item stats).
Aggression: His aggression does let him down at times -- it's only 78 in-game, and even with Hawk chemistry, it doesn't feel too incredible in game. He wins a lot of 50-50 challenges, but he loses some that I really expected him to win. His strength is tremendous, but without the aggression, he isn't as much of a beast as he should be.
Consistency: He can score four goals in one game, and disappear in the next. He can play the perfect through ball (with his back to the goal) that wins me the game, and in the next game he can't make a two-yard layoff. Inconsistency plagues Omar Al Soma, and makes it difficult for me to rely on him. When he's good, he's unbelievable. When he's bad, it's shocking. Fortunately, he's good 80% of the time, and unreliable just 20%.
Al Soma vs. Ibrahimovic
After reading all that, you might be wondering if he really is on the level of TOTS Zlatan. The short answer -- no, of course not. He's easily better than Zlatan's 90, 91, 93 and 94 items, and around the same level as Zlatan's 95-rated. The big advantage Zlatan has over him is the consistency -- I had a 7-match loan TOTS Zlatan, and he scored at least two goals a game, every game (he finished with 19 goals in his 7 games). Zlatan is also a little stronger, a little better on the ball, and a little more reliable when it comes to passing. However, Al Soma does have three stats that might make him better than TOTS Zlatan for some people.
The first of these is his pace -- he's unquestionably faster than Zlatan, and that shows in game. If you rely on pace, Al Soma is the one for you. Second, his stamina -- sure, TOTS Zlatan has 85 stamina, but he tires by the 75th minute, whereas Al Soma can go all game long, and well into extra time. Finally, and most importantly, it's the difference in balance. Whenever I play Zlatan, I find him quite easy to stop because I simply use the likes of Paolo Maldini to bully him, and thanks to his low balance, he'll topple right over. That was definitely a flaw I found when I used Zlatan -- if you manage to knock him off balance, he's going down, or losing the ball; this doesn't happen with Al Soma. You push Al Soma, you're the one who falls.
Summary
This is, without any shadow of a doubt, one of the bargains of FUT 17. He's utterly incredible, and a true game-changer. Sure, he's not on the same level as, say, a TOTS Zlatan, but he's very, very close. All of this being said, it's important to remember Al Soma is far, far cheaper than Zlatan -- he's just a measly 3% of the price of TOTS Zlatan. But is he 3% the player Zlatan is? I'd say he's 90% of the player TOTS Zlatan is. For 50K-ish, you are getting an elite player, and one you cannot go wrong with.

One of the much hyped events of Season 2 of FIFA Mobile, Weekend Tournaments, finally returns to the weekly cycle. In a new, improved version, players must use a 70-90 OVR squad consisting only of VSA Season 1 players. Players are matched based on their win count rather than fans or OVR, allowing for a more level playing field based on player skill rather than inflated OVRs causing Counters.
The New Format
The new Weekend Tournament format is a progressional 'Campaign' chapter requiring a 70-90 OVR squad consisting only of VSA Season 1 players. Evening out the inflated OVRs caused by Rank Ups, and removing the influence of 'camping', we should be seeing a rise in the popularity of Weekend Tournaments. The one downside, is that by changing your squad to a VSA players squad, you run the risk of being caught out by your LVL opponents. My advice here is to wait until all turns have been played against you before switching to your WT squad, or not starting LVLs at all until everyone in your League has finished with their WTs.
Building a VSA S1 squad has been made easier by the addition of five 500k coin packs in the store that give 10 random VSA S1 players. The key after that is creating the best squad without going over 90 OVR. You should be aiming for an 85 OVR minimum, as that will prevent you from having to face counters in any match, but ideally your squad will be just below 91 OVR. If you find your Skill Boosts taking you over 90 OVR, try playing players out of position. For example, Idrissa Gueye trained to 87 is as good as, or better than 81 +12 Samuel Umtiti at CB. (Comparison). Skill Boosts inflate OVR without impacting many stats, so training players up to use OoP will give you an advantage over players utilising Skill Boosts to bring up their OVR. If you're struggling for squad ideas, check out some of the other squads by Futhead users over on the  Futhead Mobile Twitter. You can also view the full list of VSA S1 players here on Futhead.
Once you have your squad ready, you'll be required to pay 50k coins to enter the Weekend Tournament for the first time, and will receive a 72+ VSA S1 player as an entry 'reward'. From here, the first node will unlock, which consists of a VSA match against another WT player. With OVRs limited to 70-90, skill will go a lot further than high OVRs. Like the original Weekend Tournament, it's 3 strikes and you're out. Losing 3 matches will cause the Weekend Tournament to 'lock', and will require either 5 WT Vouchers (found in the VSA S1 rewards or 400FP. Each reentry will restart you at 0 wins - to gain all rewards you will need to win 10 games with a maximum of 2 losses. Matchmaking is done by your current run's win count. If you have between 0 and 2 wins, you will only be matched with other players with 0-2 wins. Likewise, 3-4, 5-7, and 8-9 wins will only be matched with other players on those number of wins. As such, WT should get progressively harder as those losing games drop out of the possible matchup pool.
Rewards
10,000 coins per win, with incrementing Positional XP rewards every 2/3 wins make WT worthwhile to invest in long term. The tentative schedule for VSA Season 1 is to continue with the 70-90 OVR plus 11 VSA S1 players model, so your team should be useful for the next 3 WTs, before you can burn any players you've upgraded into VSA Season 2 players for VSA Season 2 WTs.
The first time you reach 3, 5, 8, and 10 wins, 25k, 50k, 150k, and 500k Positional XP is available to be claimed on side nodes off their respective nodes. Positional XP is a combination of Attacker XP, Midfielder XP, Defender XP, and/or Goalkeeper XP. While we wait for the next promotion (rumoured to be EAster), XP can be hard to come by, so this should be a welcome addition to many squads. It also allows for big coin and/or Skill Boost rewards for future Weekend Tournaments, so investing in a solid team will help you claim as many rewards as possible.
Managing to pull together 7 wins and a maximum of 2 losses unlocks the pacy 88 LW Leroy Sané's unique Squad Building Challenge. Introduced earlier this week, Squad Building Challenges will be familiar to anyone who has played console FUT, and follow the same principles - the only exception is the lack of chemistry due to the way FIFA Mobile's squad building has worked. Sané won't come cheap, requiring an 80 OVR team with a minimum of 3 VSA S1 players and all players in the right position. If you're having trouble, try using Futhead's FIFA Mobile Squad Builder, don't forget to switch to 424.
And finally, if you string together 10 wins while losing twice at a maximum, you'll unlock 91 WT Master, ST Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's Squad Building Challenge. For those chasing the Squad Building Challenge Master 93 CF Gyasi Zardes, this SBC also gives 5 SBC points. Requiring an 83 OVR 41212 Narrow squad of all Elite in-position players, and a minimum of 5 VSA S1 players, you'll have to decide if an Attacker RU2 token is worth the effort, or whether you will actually play with the Arsenal speedster. Otherwise, you may want to skip this one out.
Summary
It's back, and better than before. No more 'Bonus Rewards' that required planning in advance so you didn't miss any better offers down the track, and big XP rewards for those able to get all the way to 10 wins. The 70-90 OVR cap is a great addition, as WT becomes much more skill-based, and the unlinking of actual VSA mode evens the playing field even more. There are a couple of disappointments, however, that you can only have one squad active hurts your League in LVLs - this will require coordination amongst your league - and the high cost of the player SBC rewards may put players off completing them. However,  weighing up the cost of a RU2 Attacker token in Aubameyang compared to the SBC requirements could be beneficial for some. This is the first release of the format, and future WTs can only get better."

It's that time. We've reached the part of the calendar when regular late Friday/early Saturday (depending of course upon your time zone) Man of the Match releases are customary.
Late this evening, we got a mix of European Man of the Match and traditional all-orange MOTM player items, ranging from Manchester United's Champions League Round of 16 opening leg savior, David De Gea, to FA Cup terror, Will Grigg. And yes, the item design is appropriately enough fire-orange all the way down.
It's not immediately clear how long these limited-time-only special player items will be in packs, but based on recent batch release precident (and coinciding with the next 10 days' ""Ratings Refresh"", aka Winter Upgrades, promotion), it's probably safe to assume they'll be available until the evening of 2 March.
Here's the full list of European and domestic cup Man of the Match items:

94 GK David De Gea
90 ST Antoine Griezmann
88 RM Thomas Muller
87 RW Willian
87 ST Ciro Immobile
87 LW Sadio Mane
86 ST Michy Batshuayi

Memphis Depay has a habit of scoring late winners to stop us getting 4/4, with his winner helping Lyon to a 3-2 win over Marseille. 
Last time we got 3/4 and international games followed, we got 0/4 with all games surprisingly ending 0-0 when the European World Cup Playoffs were the focus of the second week of Matchups.
Let's hope we can do far better this time, with 6 World Cup warm-up fixtures to try and predict, it won't necessarily be easy but let's hope we can do well. An early game between World Cup hosts Russia and Brazil means that we only have until 4 p.m. GMT, or 12 p.m. EST, to predict the games by, so make sure you're ready for the earlier reset!

Russia v Brazil
Our first game features the hosts and one of the tournaments favourites. 
Gone are the years when Russia had several players in Europe’s top leagues, with only Villarreal’s winger Cheryshev currently playing in one of the top five European leagues. Their current squad has no renowned goalscorer, with Alan Dzagoev’s 9 goals in 55 appearances from midfield the current top scorer. 
Brazil will be lacking a familiar face, with Neymar’s injury almost a month ago still ruling him out. Surprisingly, their next top scorer is Barcelona midfielder Paulinho, with just 11 goals. Their defence makes up for its lack of youth with an abundance of experience, with their four regular starts having amassed 17 league titles and 9 European trophies between them. In Gabriel Jesus they might have the perfect strike partner for Neymar for many years to come, in an attack that is overflowing with flair and trickery. 
Even without their poster-boy Neymar, Brazil at big favourites for this, and I expect them to win this one without too many issues.
Game played: Friday 23rd, 4:00 p.m. (GMT) / 12:00 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Brazil win 

Argentina v Italy
One of the best attacks in world football faces off against one of the best defences from the past decade. 
Argentina barely scraped into the automatic qualification spots from the South American qualifiers, only making it thanks to a 3-1 win over Ecuador on the last matchday. With just 19 goals scored in their 18 games, they has the joint second worst attack, with their defensive record of only 16 conceded was what helped them get through. However, with an attack that features Messi, Agüero, Higuain and Di María, you would expect goals to be aplenty as they try and gel together to get the best out of their world class players. 
Sweden caused two massive upsets in qualifying, first by edging out the Netherlands to snatch second place in the group on goal difference -- almost completely due to an 8-0 thrashing of Luxembourg -- followed by beating Italy in the playoffs, meaning that the Azzurri won't be at a World Cup for the first time in 60 years. Only two of their defensive quad of Buffon, Barzagli, Bonucci and Chiellini are in the squad, so they will be hoping their less experienced players can try and get near the level of those they have replaced. It is in attack that they have suddenly improved, with Insigne offering pace and skill down the wing, and Calcio A’s top scorer Ciro Immobile in fine form and providing a real goalscoring threat. 
I feel like Argentina may have a slight advantage in this game, which is being played at the Etihad in Manchester -- a pitch that Otamendi and Agüero are very familiar with. Italy haven't beaten Argentina since they faced in the World Cup in 1982, so they will no doubt be wanting to put that long run to an end. I can see the game ending in a draw, but Argentina’s attack is just too good to bet against, so I'm going with them to win
Game played: Friday 23rd, 7:45 p.m. (GMT) / 3:45 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Argentina win

Germany v Spain
The current and previous World Cup winners face off in the pick of this week's games, as Germany host Spain in what looks a very even game in paper.
Germany and Bayern seem to have found the perfect replacement for Lahm in Joshua Kimmich, who has made the transition at both club and country almost seamlessly. And with Timo Werner finding form once again, Die Mannschaft seem to have found a replacement for their legendary striker Miroslav Klose. The last time Germany lost was back in the semifinals of EURO 2016. Since then they have won two trophies in a run of 16 wins and 5 draws, scoring 61 and conceding just 12 in that run.
Spain’s run of 12 wins and 4 draws seems somewhat underwhelming compared to their opponents, with a goal record of 56:12. Dropping just two points in all of their qualifying group, they are high in confidence and will no doubt be wanting to go into the World Cup with that unbeaten run still going. Their squad is a good mix of experience and youth, with Iniesta, Ramos and Piqué helping the younger players like Odriozola and Rodri adapt to the expectations of playing for one of the top national teams. 
This game is incredibly difficult to call, with both teams no doubt wanting to win, while also considering their other games -- Spain face Argentina while Germany host Brazil -- and the demands of clubs to keep their players fresh and injury free as they of them still have league titles and Champions League games to play when they get back to their respective clubs. Due to their incredible quality in depth, I feel like Germany may edge this one, especially if both teams field a completely different XI for each half, but a draw wouldn't surprise me really.
Game played: Friday 23rd, 7:45 p.m. (GMT) / 3:45 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Germany win

Netherlands v England
This is probably the toughest game to predict, with the Dutch hoping to gain some confidence after a shock upset in their qualifying group where Sweden finished ahead of them on goal difference, while England are without their best player. 
The Dutch are on a good run of form, winning eight of their last nine games with a goal record of 24:7, with the only negative results being a 4-0 loss to France. Their failure in qualifying has meant that their last stalwart Arjen Robben has decided to retire, but with the likes of Memphis Depay, Quincy Promes and Justin Kluivert all coming on well, the Oranje will be hoping the younger players in their squad can help rekindle some of the success from the past few decades. 
England haven't won a friendly since before the EUROs, with two losses and three draws and only scoring four goals in those games -- two of those being scores by Harry Kane who isn't in the squad due to injury. They will be hoping that Jamie Vardy can keep his recent goalscoring run going, with their defence looking far from stable in recent years, despite their great record in the qualifiers where they didn't exactly face too many tough tests.
With both English and Dutch bookies favouring the hosts, I feel like this is a very wide open game. The two have met on seven occasions since 2001, with England unable to win any of those games.
I'm going with a draw for this one, but it's very difficult to work out who will play before the lineups are revealed, so it feels almost like a shot in the dark. 
Game played: Friday 23rd, 7:45 p.m. (GMT) / 3:45 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw

France v Colombia
Next, we have two teams who may prove to be dark horses in the World Cup with the potential to do very well.
France seen to have gone a bit under the radar recently, but they seem to have found a good, young generation of players to try and take them back to the success they had at the turn of the millennium. A solid defence, all round midfield and very tricky attack means they have everything needed to win a major trophy at some point in the not too distant future. Just one loss in qualifying, and two in 17 games since the EUROs, they are in fine form and high on confidence.
Four years ago, a relatively unknown James Rodriguez became a household name after scoring the goal of the tournament in the last World Cup. A couple of underwhelming seasons at Real Madrid have passed, and he now seems to be getting back to his best at Bayern Munich. He will be hoping to help carry that form over to the national team who have been in pretty poor form, with just two wins in their last eight games.
I feel like France, who have home advantage as well, will be too much for Colombia to handle, and should be able to get the win.
Game played: Friday 23rd, 8:00 p.m. (GMT) / 4:00 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: France win

Mexico v Iceland
The last game is between two teams with very long odds of taking home the World Cup, with both teams probably aiming just to make it out of the group stage.
El Tri finished top of the CONCACAF qualification table, losing just one game in the process -- that being their final game against Honduras, which saw their opponents leapfrog the USA and knock them out of the playoffs. Their squad is a good mix of experience and youth, with PSV’s Hirving Lozano one of their best up and coming talents. Injuries may have ruled out some of their usual squad members, such as the Dos Santos brothers, but they will be hoping to keep a good run of form going which has seen them draw with a very strong Belgian side and beat Poland. 
Iceland have come a very long way in a short space is time, qualifying for their second successive tournament. Finishing top of once of the closest fought qualifying groups, they showed that their success from the EUROs was not just a lucky run. However, they are also missing some big names through injury, with star Gylfi Sigurdsson out after missing Everton’s last game. 
These two teams met a little over a year ago, with Mexico coming out as 1-0 victors on that occasion. The two times they met before that ended in goalless stalemates, so these aren't normally the most exciting of games for neutrals to watch. I think that Mexico will have the slight advantage, both with the fans in San Jose making it feel like a home game of sorts, and their players probably being a bit more fresh after a much shorter travel than their opponents. 
Game played: Saturday 24th, 2:30 a.m. (GMT) / Friday 23rd, 10:30 (EST)
My prediction: Mexico win 

So that's what I think might happen this week; what about you? Six very tough games, with friendlies often throwing up some surprise results depending on how casually the different teams take the games. Let's just hope that this won't be the third time that a late Memphis Depay goal ruins a perfect score in Matchups!
As this is a bumper week with six games, we have two players to choose from as your rewards. Alan Dzagoev’s 85 Overall CM card  will  be a very nice help for completing Yashin’s Icon campaign, while Real Sociedad striker Willian Jose makes a very good option for a Brazilian with a good skill boost to help with some future Icons. If neither of them take your fancy, you can pick up some coins to help upgrade the rest of your team. 
Good luck and happy predicting!"

Like a phoenix from the ashes -- or Patrice Evra from a European football ban -- FUT Weekly Podcast is back.
After two long weeks, there's a lot for the pod's Ben and regular staple around these parts Jamey, aka FUT Economist, to cover.
Amongst the topics are the aftermath of the week and a half long FUT Birthday promotion, which Jamey believes has led to one of the most significant market crashes in Ultimate Team history. Futhead's own Luke Zimmermann (aka 'lukezim') joins the fray to weigh in on his first hand experiences with one of the crown jewels of the promo, 92 SBC End of an Era Kaka, as well as whether or not EA may be testing future SBC/pack methods without us even realizing it in-game currently. All this, plus some talk (based on reader input/feedback and questions) as to whether or not there should be a second Weekend League for competitive non-pros.

Feels good coming off a perfect week of Marquee Matchup predictions! Got to revel in the feeling while we can because at any moment EA can throw that curveball and change things up dramatically.. Another week of not so bad pack rewards, too; however, since we are past the halfway point in FIFA, we think we’d all love to see something special in the rewards to keep that hype going. 
In terms of predictions for this week, we have quite a few derbies, but also a way for EA to throw in some more international matches. Lots to cover, so keep reading to stay on top of the next installment of everyone's favorite weekly SBC.

International Curveballs
The current Marquee Matchups feature an entire selection of international fixtures, yet next cycle has both international and domestic ties to choose from. Although it is most likely EA will return to club matches, it is important investors stay aware of all possibilities. So, looking at the fixture list here are the four we feel most likely to feature. 
Germany vs Brazil
England vs Italy
Spain vs Argentina
Mexico vs Croatia
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Bayern Munich vs Borussia Dortmund
Match Info: The Bundesliga comes back from the international break swinging. The two most notable teams square off over the weekend in what will surely be a quality tie. Tune in and make sure to grab a couple non-rares for the best value.   

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Chelsea vs Tottenham
Match Info:  We hop over to England where the Premier League also returns with some quality matches. This London derby is pivotal for both sides looking to obtain those coveted UCL spots, and EA would be mistaken to overlook its marquee importance. Again, stick to the highest rated non-rares here.  

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Barcelona vs Sevilla
Match Info: For this fixture we opted for mass appeal rather than a traditional rivalry. It is a top six battle, with Sevilla trying to hold onto a Europe spot. It is definitely important enough, but there is a case for it to be swapped with the Serie A fixture in the sleeper section.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


America vs Cruz Azul
Match Info: Rounding out our main picks is a derby in Mexico. The Liga MX has a tendency to miss out on the Marquee Matchups SBC, but we believe this tie can break that trend. Plenty of non-rares here that also hold value very well due to the League SBC.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 70 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there tends to be some variance each week, let's take a look at some more outside the box picks that could make their way in:
Juventus vs AC Milan
Match Info: Mentioned briefly above, our pick from the Serie A this cycle is a matchup between two titans of Italian football. Milan is having a rejuvenating run of form, while Juventus looks to establish themselves in pull position for another domestic title. A game that does have a lot of significance, it all hinges on if EA go for mainstream or diversity of selections.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Young Boys vs Basel
Match Info: Just north of the Italian border, the two top teams (and rivals) in Switzerland square off in a compelling fixture. This game checks all the boxes for EA, so as investors make sure to cast an eye over here to keep your investments diverse.   

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Pohang Steeler vs Ulsan Tiger
Match Info: A pick we have been waiting to make for a long time! Finally, a K League match that can warrant a selection by EA. If you plan to invest, stock up on the highest rated non-rares you can, but also know selling into the hype could be quite profitable here.  

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 68 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
Missed the mark last week, but hey it was the international break so it doesn’t count, right? Good, we think so too, and here’s and extra deep sleeper to keep you quiet about it.   

FC Nantes vs ASSE & LA Galaxy vs LAFC
Recap
If you're new to Marquee Matchup investing take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team. 
With plenty of big games to choose from we would love to hear your pick below! Also, feel free to share your thoughts on any games we missed."

Spencer 'Unilad Gorilla' Ealing officially laid claim to being the top FIFA player in the world after beating Kai 'Deto' Wollin by an aggregate scoreline of 7-3 over two legs in Friday's FIFA Interactive World Cup 2017 Grand Final in London.
Ealing, a six-time Gfinity champion, had fallen just a bit short of the highest level victories all year. He began his FIFA Ultimate Team Championship series campaign with a disappointing performance in Paris, failing to get out of his group. The Birmingham native came back with a vengeance in May, in the Season Two Madrid Regional, but he was pegged back by Italian Daniele 'IcePrinsipe' Paolucci in the grand final. This time, however, he got the last laugh. His relentless attacking style was unmatched by Deto's posession play.
The PS4 final leg began at a brisk pace. Gorilla was off the mark quickly, capitalizing off a mistake from Deto, but the German quickly responded with three goals to make it 3-1 by the 42nd minute. Gorilla came back with a crucial goal before halftime to turn it right back around and end the five-goal half. Gorilla leveled it up at three just before the hour mark, and that was how the leg finished. On his home console, Gorilla broke the early deadlock with a goal in the 33rd minute with Luis Suarez. Right before the stroke of halftime, Gorilla doubled his lead through Ruud Gullit, while the real-life Dutch maestro watched from the first row. The second half brought two more goals from the Englishman, and the second leg ended 4-0.
Gorilla's route to the final was almost too easy for him. He scored an astounding 18 goals in six matches, blanking FC Basel's Florian 'CodyDerFinisher' Müller by a scoreline of 5-0 in the first leg of the console's grand final alone. The fairly eventful second leg finished with him winning 7-2 on aggregate.
Wollin in his own right has been a longtime FIFA professional; he's been in the scene since 2005. The German held a 1-0 advantage over fellow countryman, Vfl Wolfsburg's Timo 'TimoX' Siep, heading into the second leg of the PS4 console grand final. But things soon turned in Timo's favor, as Deto's Sergio Ramos was sent off for a foul in the box and Timo equalized on the subsequent penalty. The game remained scoreless and had to go to a golden goal third leg, and it was off to a rapid start. An unblievable goal from TimoX was called back due to an offside, and just seconds later, Deto ended his opponent's FIWC campaign with a score off a free-kick from the right flank.
The FIWC's Knockout Stage presented some of the most memorable moments of the whole tournament, including veteran Colombian Janoz's 6-1 demolition of Corentin 'Vitality RocKy' Chevrey in the divisional quaterfinals, and TimoX and IcePrinsipe's exhilarating back-and-forth PS4 semifinal affair that ended with an aggregate scoreline of 6-5. 
The group stage was, as predicted, rife with drama. Hashtag United's marquee man Tassal 'Hashtag Tass' Rushan finished dead last in his Xbox group, despite entering as one of the tournament's favorites and enjoying two brilliant performances during FIFA Ultimate Team Championship Series.
Tass' group was considered the most competitive by many, including YouTuber and FIFA community influencer Chu 'ChuBoi' Morah, who was also one of the hosts at the event. Chevrey, who won the Berlin FUT Champions Grand Final in May, topped the group. He was followed by surprise candidate Philip 'FilthyP94' Balkhe, American Joseph 'Epsilon Joey' Calabro, and AFC Ajax's Dani Hagebeuk. Paris Saint-Germain's newcomer, Ahmed AlMeghessib, finished just shy of qualifying and was knocked out on goal difference. PSG's other player, Rafael 'Rafifa13' Fortes, who won the FUT Champions Miami Regional, finished with a disappointing seven points.
Despite the hype surrounding Xbox's Group Two, it was the other Xbox group that featured both of the console's grand finalists. Group One's winner, CodyDerFinisher, and second-place finisher, Gorilla, eventually made the console grand final. They were followed by AS Roma's Aman Seddiqi and Javier 'Janoz' Muñoz.
PS4's Group One was won by IcePrinsipe. He was followed by Argentinian Gonzalo 'nicolas99fc' Vilalba, TimoX, and Deto. Shaun 'xShellzz' Springette, who surprised everyone in Berlin, was knocked out, finishing with only six points. PS4's Group Two was topped by Frenchman Johann 'ManiiKa' Simon, and followed by Lucas 'LucasRep_98' da Costa, Mohammed 'Mo_Aubameyang' Harkous.
While FIWC had a bit of its steam taken out of by coming so late in the life cycle of FIFA 17, it's capped a tremendous year for competitive FIFA. The best is surely yet to come in FIFA 18."

A supreme TOTW 27 Prediction effort from Aaron leaves us with just five players to disect in this weeks Unpredictables. He managed to pick up all the big names as well leaving us with Gelson Martins and Hakim Ziyech as our standout additions. Lets find out why we missed them this week. 
Gelson Martins – RM – Sporting Lisbon
The title race in Portugal looks set to go to the wire with Porto, Benfica and Sporting all in the hunt. And Sporting did their best to keep pace with the two sides above them putting in a solid 2-0 win against Rio Ave last Sunday. The star man on the day was Gelson Martins who scored one, and laid on an assist for Bas Dost. That’s now 7 goals and 6 assist for Martins this season. 
Aaron's View: I was very close to including Martins in my prediction and actually mentioned him under Reynet, had I not selected a second keeper. Fair choice in a packed midfield.
Hakim Ziyech – CM – Ajax
Ajax put Sparta Rotterdam to the sword last Sunday with a 5-2 win bringing many IF opportunities with it. EA have gone for the supremely talented Hakim Ziyech who picked up a brace from midfield making it 8 goals and 11 assists for him this season. PSV hold a seven-point lead at the top heading in to the final matches in the Eredivisie and Ajax will need them to slip up more than once if they're to pounce. Ajax play PSV in three weeks time. 
Aaron's View: Two goals for Ziyech. However, with him being outside the top five in the Dutch league, I was put off including him in my prediction.
Jorge Mere – RB – FC Koln
Cologne’s great escape is still on, as they bounced right back from a 3-1 defeat against Werder Bremen last Monday to beat high flying Bayer Leverkusen 2-0 this week. The IF from this game wasn’t most obvious though with Jorge Mere making five clearances to go with the clean sheet to claim his place in the TOTW. Bayer didn’t help their cause much in this one though with striker Alario sent off in the 32nd minute receiving a straight red. 
Aaron's View: Defence was another area which wasn't short of options this week. Mere didn't score or assist, but he did pick up a 1.5 from Kicker. I opted for the goalscoring defenders and Subotic can feel hard done by for missing out.
Alexandr Belenov – GK – FC Ufa
FC Ufa are within striking distance of a European qualification spot in the Russian Premier League after picking up back to victories including their latest, a 1-0 victory against FC Krasnodar. With Zenit (5th) and Krasnodar’s (4th) form being patchy the last few weeks, FC Ufa will certainly fancy their chances. The IF here goes to Alexandr Belenov for his seven saves in Ufa’s important 1-0 win against one of the teams they're trying to catch. 
Aaron's View: The goalkeeper was always a difficult decision with the second choice always likely to be 'unpredictable'. Belenov makes the cut for his seven saves which I feel is helped by him being the only real Russian Premier League option.
Lloyd Kelly – LB – Bristol City
There’s no doubt that Bristol City’s League Cup heroics have affected their league form with The Robins sliding out of the play-off places in recent weeks. They did however take a step back in the right direction with a hard fought 1-0 win against Ipswich on Saturday. Lloyd Kelly was MOTM from left back but with just a single assist to his name, this is a very hard one to predict. 
Aarons View: By far the hardest to predict this week as there were other defenders scoring twice, or picking up a couple of assists.  I didn't even consider Kelly with the one assist."

Pep Guardiola's first trophy as Manchester City boss is in the books.
Upping his stunning career major cup tally to 10 trophies (and counting), the Spanish skipper and his club easily cruised past lackadaisical Arsenal 3-0 to bring the 2017-18 Carabao Cup trophy back north.
With Sergio Aguero the sitting Premier League Player of the Month and David Silva possessing multiple FIFA 18 special items already, captain Vincent Kompany gets the FUT nod as Man of the Match for contributing the second goal and helping preserve a clean sheet after several years of struggling to maintain his fitness. For whatever it's worth, WhoScored's algorithm agreed in determing their MOTM.
His 86-overall rated special orange item is available in packs now though it's not immediately known whether this is a typical 24-hour Man of the Match affair (well, ~23 given that the item dropped around 8:15 p.m. UK time), if it'll be in packs until Friday with the rest of the current MOTM items available, or if it'll get a full week in packs in its own right.
If you pull this limited-time item or go wild and buy one off the transfer market, let us know how it compares to his Scream Team version in the comments below."

Happy New Year! The extension of Carniball and an event-less break should have you fired up and ready for the next FIFA Mobile promotion, Lunar New Year. The Year of the Dog has officially started, and Prime Icon Edwin van der Sar leads the way with Thiago Motta (born in 1982) the old heads amongst the other ten 1994-born Lunar New Year players in this 10 day long event.
The Players
If you can get your hands on him, Manchester City's Bernardo Silva's Crimson RW 92 is a solid option to play opposite Mobile Master Cristiano Ronaldo for Deco's Icon Campaign, and Red Mancunians jealous of Manchester City and Liverpool's Otamendi and van Dijk 91 CBs get one of their own in Victor Lindelöf's Crimson 91 CB. To add to the Red Devils contingent comes 98 Prime Icon Edwin van der Sar. Born in 1970, van der Sar's heroism in goal for Ajax, Juventus, Fulham, Manchester United and the Dutch national team exceeds stats in-game, but once again the team at EA have managed to create an item befitting of his iconic career. 120 in all five Goalkeeper stats, 120 in four outfield stats, 90+ in all other stats except Crossing, Free Kick and Aggression, van der Sar is the first goalkeeper to Rainbow (if you like 'keeper runs), and his low Aggression should ensure he stays in goal and doesn't charge down strikers only to be chipped. At 6' 6"" and with amazing stats van der Sar looks set to be the best goalkeeper available so far, but like all Prime Icons he comes at a hefty cost.
Corentin Tolisso's 91 CM, Thiago Motta's 91 CDM, João Cancelo's 90 RB, Morgan Sanson's 90 CAM, and Kepa Arrizabalaga's 90 GK are the other Master players featured, with support from Maximillian Philipp's 89 LW, Alessio Romagnoli's 89 CB, Andrew Robertson's 88 LB, and Davie Selke's 88 ST. Each player also has a Lucky Lunar New Year item. Silva CAM 86, Lindelöf RB 85, Tolisso RM 85, Cancelo RW 84, Motta CB 84, Sanson CDM 84,  Philipp ST 83, and Robertson LM 82 all feature interesting position changes to help build your squad, while Arrizabalaga GK 83, Romagnoli CB 83, and Selke ST 82 round out the Lunar New Year players.
As was the case for Carniball, Lucky Players are tradable straight away, whilst Crimson Players will be tradable after the program ends.
Lunar New Year Campaign
Lanterns Chapter
7 single-play events and an eighth repeatable event cycle every 8 hours. Winning one of the first seven events will earn you Red Envelopes or Lunar New Year points. The eighth event rewards coins with a chance at more Red Envelopes or Lunar New Year points. Red Envelopes are spent in the Red Envelopes Chapter, while Lunar New Year points are used to progress in the Celebration Chapter.
Red Envelope Chapter

24 Red Envelopes await in a 'Lucky Dip' style chapter. Every 8 hours three featured items will appear as Rewards in the Red Envelope Chapter. Each of the 24 Envelopes gives 888 to 88,888 coins, and three of the Envelopes contain one of the featured rewards. This means you could find all three rewards in the first 3 Envelopes you open, or they could be in the last 3 of the 24. Each Envelope can be purchased once every 8 hours, so it would be advised to save your Red Envelope currency until offers you fancy come around, so you can make sure you obtain the rewards you want.
Celebration Chapter
Spend Lunar New Year points to progress through the Celebration Chapter, where all 11 Crimson Players are available. Nodes always give Lucky Coins, and will also give either coins, Training XP, Skill Boosts or a mix of the three. The costs for each Crimson player and Edwin van der Sar's total cost can be seen below:

11 different Bonus offers for 30 LNY points each are available after each player. For the first time role specific (Attacker/Midfielder/Defender/Goalkeeper) Skill Boosts can be purchased, so if you're looking for some Finishing Boosts, keep the Attacker Skill Boosts offer in mind. Asides from the bonus offers, there are 1407 Lucky Coins, 10.1 million coins, 2.07 million Training XP and 4.1k Skill Boosts available.
Edwin van der Sar requires all 11 Crimson Players making up a 110 OVR team, huge requirements considering that the best formations (433 Attack, 433 Defend, and 433 Holding) all leave one midfielder out of position and unable to utilise their Skill Boost.
Packs
Two Lunar New Year packs for 350k coins, or unlimited packs for 1000FP and a bundle of 10 with a topper of one Lucky Player for 10k FP are available to be bought in the store. Appearing alongside these offers are Lucky Coin packs and Firecracker packs. Two Lucky Coin offers rotate every 8 hours. 25 Lucky Coins for 125k coins, 22.5k Training XP, or 50 SBs, 60 Lucky Coins for 5 Red Envelopes, or 150 Lucky Coins for a random Lucky Player. Each 25 Lucky Coin offer can be purchased up to 5 times per rotation, the 60 Lucky Coin offer has a 3 pack limit, and the 150 Lucky Coin offer can only be purchased once each time it is available.
Firecracker packs offer Skill Boosts, Red Envelopes, Lucky Players, Coins and LNY Points, but must be unlocked in order (1 through 5). Once unlocked they have no limit on the number of purchases. Each Firecracker pack requires a suitably numbered Firecracker currency, Firecracker 1 currency to open Firecracker 1 packs, etc.
A TOTY style Chain pack is available, with a US$1 cost for 10 Red Envelopes, and unlocking the Chain. 500FP for a Lucky Player, 2k FP for 8 LNY points, 5k FP for 40 LNY items, and 10k FP for 100 Red Envelopes.
Guide
Getting the most out of LNY lies heavily on obtaining LNY points and Red Envelope currency. Saving Red Envelopes for when LNY points are on offer will help you progress further in the Celebration Chapter, however, I would advise not spending your LNY points until near the end of the event when you know how many points you have. Three separate Red Envelopes every 8 hours contain one of the bonus rewards, so once you have all three, don't open any more as the remaining ones can only contain coins. Saving those points for future offers will enable you to get more bonus rewards.
Choosing a Crimson Player to pursue should rely on three factors: Whether the player will improve your squad or you will sell them, the bonus offer associated with that player, and the number of LNY points you obtain.
Summary
8 hour cycles are a step up from Carniball's 12 hour grinds, but are still not as exhaustive as End of an Era's 6 hour VSA cycles. Players for every position except LWB and RWB should help improve squads, and cause other players' prices to drop a little with new Elite players on the market. More coins/Training XP/Skill Boosts as always, and more 90+ players as potential Rank UP tokens should cater to the needs of most players. The card art is again phenomenal, and Lunar New Year looks like another exciting event from the FIFA Mobile team. Happy New Year once again, and good luck!
TL;DR

Event lasts for 10 days
11 players with two versions, Lucky and Crimson
Lucky Players are tradable straight away, Crimson after the event ends

WIth the exception of Messi Stans (or perhaps Atletico backers), it's hard to imagine many being anything but excited after the reigning (and likely soon repeat) winner of FIFA's The Best Men's Player award Cristiano Ronaldo was named cover star for ""FIFA 18"".
Big, high-profile games like FIFA necessitate star power. And while it was cool to see the ""next generation"" of stars get the nod on FIFA 17's cover vote, returning to the likes of a Ronaldo (not unlike Messi before him) seems to restore a natural order of sorts to the FIFA/FUT universe.
While the cover art had been revealed (and ostensibly set-in-stone) for some time, one common refrain in social media comments was that Ronaldo was pictured in the defending two-time European champions Real Madrid's 2016/2017 kit, rather than their newer 17/18 shirt the team's been sporting in their early seemingly more-dominant-than-ever matches.
This afternoon, amidst Chelsea and Spurs' epic match and before a full Sunday slate in Spain that includes both Madrid and rivals FC Barcelona, EA unveiled what appears to be a finalized FIFA 18 cover (or as they put it, ""pack""):
Final #FIFA18 pack with @cristiano in the new @realmadrid kit! Subscribe to see a new trailer tomorrow! https://t.co/RRsUn909Wu pic.twitter.com/wJqm8f3Pnk— EA SPORTS FIFA (@EASPORTSFIFA) August 20, 2017

What do you think of the apparently finalized cover art? Good look? 'Messi better'? 'In-before-should-be-Bendtner-instead'? Let us know in the comments below."

An announcement in the FIFA 18 Ultimate Team web app (as well as in-game) caught a lot of users off-guard this afternoon, causing some confusion and perhaps introducing more questions than the hype intended.
We already knew that Path to Glory items who receive International Man of the Match (or iMOTM) items or in-forms this summer would continue to be upgraded while Ones to Watch will cease being upgraded when their respective domestic campaigns end. However, in addition to those upgrades, we now know the item art will also change from a Path to Glory item type's to a new design called ""Path to Glory Selected.""
So what does that mean exactly?
What is a Path to Glory Selected item type?
A ""Path To Glory Selected"" item in FUT 18 is a Path to Glory player that makes their national team's World Cup roster this summer. The premise is the same, but the card art will change.
Does that mean the PTG I have will automatically upgrade?
The item art will change if they make their country's final 23-man World Cup roster. They will only receive ratings upgrades if they receive future in-forms or iMOTM (or equivalent) items this summer.
But doesn't 'certain national team performances' imply upgrades based on team results?
No, that is not our interpretation and not what we expect to happen.
If I buy a non in-form version of that player, will it automatically become a PTG Selected?
No. Only the existing Path To Glory players selected to their final World Cup rosters will be converted automatically to PTG Selected dynamic player items. Other non-inform and inform items will remain the same as before.
Is this really anything that different from what was announced prior?
Nope. As best as we can tell, the item art will change slightly, but everything we knew before, that iMOTM and IFs this summer would continue upgrading Path to Glory items, is the same.
So this is in place of a World Cup mode/DLC/possible stand alone title?
You're kidding, right?

If you still are confused or have questions, let us know in the comments below and we'll do our best to clear those up."

Market Overview
Wow, it’s April already! Time keeps flying by with this year’s FIFA, and this month should have some amazing content in store for us. Another round of the FUT Champions Cup in Manchester should be a joy to watch, plus we have the much anticipated Team of the Season promotion that should kick off around the end of this month. In the meantime, the general FUT market is still climbing out of the FUT Birthday crash, while following its normal Weekend League hype and sell-off price trend. 
Honing in on the Path to Glory sector, most players’ prices rose with the general FUT market. Recently, EA released clarification on PTG Selected items, which drove certain items’ price up. Make sure to note that this hype is rather unwarranted at the moment considering PTG Selected items will not receive additional perks until the World Cup (more on the promo here). With domestic seasons ending soon, dynamic player markets are getting tricky to navigate, so keep reading to stay smart with your coins as big promotions loom! 
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats



The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  A little unexpected, but there were some substantial high/low spreads this week. High differences in this section gives us hope for using these items to flip for a quick coin, but make sure to stay patient and always do your research before testing it out. Some players that catch our eye here are Leon Goretzka, Giuliano and Saul.  

Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take: This week brought us some large volatility figures across the board, which we like to see when trying to find high hype potential individuals. Gelson Martins might be an interesting shout to see if you can catch a low price due to panic selling, while Raphael Varane and Ilkay Gundogan could both benefit from their club’s packed fixture list this month.

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Quite the assortment of beta sizes this week. Well, with big promos on the horizon the window for price increases is getting smaller for most elite items. So, with that in mind Alejandro Gomez and Thorgan Hazard look like bounce back candidates if you can get in on some open bids. If you like trying your luck stick to the likes of Alex Sandro and Anthony Martial, but sell whenever you see profit!
TOTW & Upgrade Shout 
Two yeses on the weekly roundup, with Isco and Dimitri Payet staking their claims for an inform, and upgrade, in TOTW 29. Payet netted a goal and grabbed an assist in a 3-1 win Saturday, making for a rather traditional TOTW shout. 
Isco’s case is rather peculiar considering his TOTW shout stems from a performance last Tuesday (yes before TOTW 28) where he scored a hat-trick against Argentina. It will be interesting to see if EA recognize the Spanish magician for his accomplishment, or gloss over him for performances this past weekend.

Big Winner -  Dimitri Payet  (Olympique Marseille)
We’re making it back-to-back French left wingers to highlight this segment. Dimitri Payet has been in solid form all season, and although he didn’t have the highest weekly return his consistently positive performance makes him this week’s biggest winner. 
Now, the ex-Hammer presents a very interesting situation based on a short term versus long term outlook. Following a positive weekly return, Payet’s price tends to dip slightly the following week, so keep that in mind when investing. That being said, the winger is a consistent starter for his side; therefore, his price always rises back up when he’s announced in the starting XI. 
Keep the preceding trends in mind, and they can be applied to other players in his price range, but also note that long term his outlook may be poor. With the way Payet has been playing he might drum up some hype for a Team of the Season Most Consistent item (barring an inform this week and assuming they still have that team this FIFA). If that is the case try to avoid him as his price will drop significantly considering he’ll never be able to match that TOTS rating.
Big Loser - Alex Sandro (Juventus) 
It seems like we’ve picked on Marquinhos a few times in this segment, so we’re going to choose a different Brazilian defender this week. Alex Sandro had a rough weekly return of -17%, and although an injury contributed to this, he is still our biggest loser. 
Being the biggest loser isn’t always a bad thing, and often a player in this section makes a jump up to biggest winner in just a week’s time. Although we want you to keep that in mind, it’s important to address that players in Sandro’s position have a perilous month ahead. 
The ex-Potro fullback has undeniable hype potential given his high volatility (~5,000) and FUT Champs meta appeal, but just like Payet he is in a position to land a TOTS. Since PTG items won’t get upgraded alongside TOTS items that is a worry for investors, but it also means after every game without a star performance this item will drop in price. 
There is definitely hope for Sandro, and a prince decline only makes him more affordable. We just want you to understand the risk in picking up items of his caliber at this current point in FUT. If you do want to snatch one up, make sure it’s on a low open bid, and sell into the hype!

Recap
To round this week off, the general FUT market continues to see price increase post FUT Birthday crash; however, as we enter April it is time to plan for the big promotions on the horizon: Team of the Knockout Stage & Team of the Season. In terms of PTG players, a brief announcement by EA about “PTG Selected” items drummed up some hype, but don’t get caught up in that just yet. A lot of positive returns bodes well for this sector, but overall it seems prices might be stabilizing, so keep your focus on high hype individuals. This next couple of weeks are going to be crunch time in FUT, so enjoy the calm and sell into the hype!

With PTG Selected being announced, which PTG items are looking forward to most at the World Cup in Russia? Share below, and we’ll catch you all next week!

A star heavy XI leads FIFA 18 Ultimate Team's Team of the Week 29 as we get closer and closer to an expected early Team of the Season release to account for the forthcoming World Cup.
The bench doesn't leave much to be desired (though surely to some partisans and hardcore collectors), but starters include an upgrade to Arsenal sweat-god Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, former Bundesliga Golden Boot rival Bayern's Robert Lewandowski (now up to 93), Spurs' Chelsea antagonist Dele Alli, and a ""Calcio A"" trio of note of Ivan Perisic and Juventus' Juan Cuadrado and Sami Khedira. Certainly not a bad little side but also probably not the empty-your-wallet Team of the Week like some of the others we've seen this particular FIFA be released.
The full squad comes in the wake of last night's surprise FUT Swap Deals announcement.

If you wanted a fresh, new approach to FIFA 18 Ultimate Team Live Content, this might just be it.
But does it go far enough and will it keep you fully engaged for the full 23 (that's right, 23) day duration of the program?
Late Tuesday/early Wednesday, EA announced FUT Swap Deals, a new SBC-powered Ultimate Team promotion in the same spirit as FUT Birthday's Weekly Objectives and Squad Building Challenges. Basically through Objectives (likely Weekly, though Daily remain in the realm of possibilities), SBCs, and by winning Daily Knockout Tournaments, you'll be able to earn a maximum of 12 tokens over the next three weeks. You can then go ahead and permanently exchange those player items in SBCs for players rated as high as 91-overall (for 11 tokens) or as low as 84 (and requiring just two).
The list of players (all untradeable) includes a couple players of note with some of the items appearing to pay lip service to previous in-forms/special items for those players. The others are all the kind of ratings you could envision those respective players receiving had they gotten another IF or two, or in 88 Carlos Tevez's case, received an End of an Era or Throwback SBC type item.
That said, the FUT Swap Deals roster isn't exactly overwhelming. For many hardcore players, it's tough to imagine the majority of these players even being able to crack their side at this point in the game. The far more casual (or perhaps new) players may welcome the chance to have a new reason to play the game for the next couple of weeks to bring a high-80/low-90 rated player in the likes of a 91 Luka Modric or 91 Alexis Sanchez to their teams though.
Just to make sure you've got everything, here's a brief primer hitting the high-level points one more time on what to expect from FUT Swap Deals.
What is FUT Swap Deals?
FUT Swap Deals is a new program similar to FUT Birthday that will allow you to unlock untradeable players from Objectives (whether Weekly or Daily is not yet known), Squad Building Challenges, and by winning Daily Knockout Tournaments. You can then use as few as two and as many as eleven of those players (out of a maximum obtainable twelve) to trade them for higher-rated untradeable items through SBCs.
How do I earn FUT Swap Deals tokens?
By completing Objectives (yet to be announced), SBCs, and winning select Daily Knockout Tournaments (e.g. the ones you can win up to two times weekly to qualify for the Weekend League).
When does everything take place?
That's less certain. The first opportunity (A Daily Knockout Tournament) starts at 3 a.m. ET (9 a.m. UK) on 4 April and runs until 6 April at the same time. Untradeable Alvaro Negredo is the first unlockable FUT Swap Deals player item; it shares the same ratings as his base item. You can either use him in one of the FUT Swap Deal SBCs, or keep him if you're a collector of sorts.
How many FUT Swap Deals items can I get/how many SBCs can I do?
You can earn a maximum of 12. How many SBCs you're able to do depends on which players you desire to unlock.
How many tokens do the FUT Swap Deals player cost?
-- 84 ST Keita Balde Diao: 2
-- 84 CDM Jordan Henderson: 2
-- 81 LB Wendell: 2
-- 87 CM Koke: 4
-- 86 CAM Dimitri Payet: 4
-- 86 CAM Santi Cazorla: 4
-- 90 ST Zlatan Ibrahimovic: 7
-- 88 CF Lorenzo Insigne: 7
-- 85 RW Timo Werner: 7
-- 91 CM Luka Modric: 11
-- 88 ST Carlos Tevez: 11
-- 91 ST Alexis Sanchez: 11
You can also trade tokens of the following denominations for the following types of packs (all tradeable):
-- Premium Gold Pack: 1
-- Rare Gold Pack: 3
-- Prime Gold Players Pack: 5
-- Ultimate Pack: 10
So it's like FUT Birthday in that you can't get all the highest rated items?
Correct. You'll have to make a choice if you're interested in both 91 Modric and 91 Alexis, for example.
So is this promo a good thing?
To be determined. The biggest constructive criticism early seems to be that there's a grind ceiling set such that no matter how much above and beyond you're willing or able to go, you're still capped at acquiring just one of the higher rated reward players. It remains to be seen whether or not EA would consider changing course and introducing more opportunities to earn tokens so more of the player items can be unlocked or not.
Anything else of note?
Purely speculation on our part, but with the promo ending 27 April, that could mark the beginning of Team of the Season with it being a World Cup year and all."

We were so close with our European options last week; however, EA threw us a major curveball and elected to select matches from the Europa league instead of UCL. Honestly, it was nice to get a change of pace at this stage in FIFA, and it has us speculating even harder about what selections will be made this coming cycle. With plenty of high profile matches across numerous leagues this week, let's dive straight into our predictions!
European Options
This week’s Marquee Matchup selections are entirely from Europa League ties, so could we see EA switch over to its Champions League counterpart next week? That’s a million dollar question going forward, but we thought we would leave these fixtures here for you to see. Keep in mind, it might be best to sell into the hype to get some guaranteed profit. 
Juventus vs Real Madrid
Sevilla vs Bayern
Barcelona vs Roma
Liverpool vs Manchester City
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Barcelona vs Valencia
Match Info: Kicking us off this week is a top four matchup in La Liga.This pick allows you to double down with Barcelona players, and on the flip side there are plenty of low risk Valencia players too. So, regardless of this fixture’s inclusion it presents a tidy option for investors.     

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Tottenham vs Manchester City
Match Info:  Usually, no main matchups selection is complete without a high profile Premier League game, and this week Tottenham and Man City deliver! With the season drawing to an end, every point become even more crucial, with Spurs looking to lock up a top four finish.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Schalke vs Dortmund
Match Info: Next on our list is another top four clash, this time in the Bundesliga. This fixture should be a joy to watch in real life; however, a sneaky Bayer Leverkusen vs Eintracht Frankfurt matchup could steal some thunder here. Make sure to consider both fixtures, but we still like the look of the former matchup better. 

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Porto vs Benfica
Match Info: Finally, a traditional derby makes this week’s prediction list! These two Portuguese giants always drum up some hype when they play, and both sides boast a substantial selection of low risk, non-rare gold items. Make sure to consider selling into the hype, but otherwise players from these teams should hold their value well regardless.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
There’s never four clear locks for Marquee Matchups, and we would not be doing our due diligence as investors if we didn’t consider additional fixtures. With already plenty of writing above, we’re going to keep this section short this week, and just hit you with the bare essentials: 
PSV vs Ajax
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Galatasaray vs Istanbul Basaksehir 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Middlesbrough vs Bristol City
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Atalanta vs Inter
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
With EA’s wild selections this week, it seems anything is possible. That being said, this week’s deep sleeper isn't too radical; however, it might be time the Pro League recieved a little more love.  

Anderlecht vs Club Brugge
Recap
If you're new to Marquee Matchup investing take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team. 
With plenty of big games to choose from we would love to hear your pick below! Also, feel free to share your thoughts on any games we missed."

FIFA market and trading experts WyseFIFA and FUT Economist -- both regular contributors around these parts -- jump on with FUT Weekly Podcast's Ben to breakdown the intriguing new FUT Swap Deals promo. Is this what folks have been looking for? And can this particular stab at it get us to Team of the Season adequately?
Plus, the pod talks about what a potential Team of the Knockout Stage (assuming the promo goes forward as it has in recent FIFA Ultimate Teams) would mean for the market (hint: a big ol' market crash), how you can potentially accrue wealth before TOTS simply by doing nothing at all, what Team of the Week 29 brings to the game, and as an added bonus, mini-R9/Prime-R9 and multi-Petit reviews. Wayward co-host Horace returns to the fold as well.

Even with all eyes on Gamescom (and with it, FIFA 18), Team of the Week continues to return to form.
For the second straight week, with all the major domestic leagues ramped up, Ultimate Team's TOTW feels like a proper Team of the Week. Manchester United's dabbing wonder midfielder Paul Pogba gets his first IF of the new campaign -- which, to those wondering, is not expected to impact his previous Ones to Watch item as the season it reflected is done and dusted. Joining him is FUT icon (lower case i) Victor Ibarbo, now honing his craft in Japan.
A number of other bigger names (from Jonas to Riyad Mahrez to Mauro Icardi) round out the side.

Last week's score: 12/23
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad Link:http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7741973/


Goalkeeper
Keylor Navas - GK - OVR 85
Although on paper a 3-0 Real Madrid away win over Deportivo looks very routine, it was anything but. Navas was impressive once again between the sticks making a total of five saves before ensuring his clean sheet was kept with a penalty save in the last minutes of the match. Navas claimed the maximum rating from Marca which often signifies a goalkeeper being selected.
Defenders
Marcos Alonso - LWB - OVR 79
Everyone knows what Alonso is capable of after his first season with the Blues and although the first game resulted in a poor 3-2 defeat Alonso made sure the second was more of a celebration. The Spaniard was beyond impressive scoring both of Chelsea's goals in a 2-1 away win over Tottenham.
Damien Da Silva - CB - OVR 77
Caen picked up their first win of the season on their third attempt of the season with a 2-0 away win over Lille. Central defender Da Silva scored the first of the two goals and picked up a 7/10 from L'Equipe for doing just that. He and several other defenders stand a chance but L'Equipe is usually reliable.
Nico Elvedi - RB - OVR 74
With Elvedi already picking up an IF this season, it means that should he get in again he will change to a gold item. The Swiss defender scored the only goal in Gladbach's 1-0 home win and was awarded the joint highest mark of the week for doing so. The chances of this one happening are pretty high. Elvedi is one to keep an eye on for sure.
Midfielders
Ignacio Piatti - LW - OVR 79
Another top performance from Piatti once again puts him in the line for an IF. The Argentine scored two of Montreal's three goals as they managed a 3-1 home win over Real Salt Lake,
Adrien Rabiot - CM - OVR 80
Neymar backed up his debut with another world class performance, scoring twice and assisting another two. However due to getting an IF in the previous side, it rules him out of this one. Rabiot was the next best in terms of L'equipe picking up a decent score of 8/10. Although he has just the one goal on paper an eight rating in a 6-2 win does stand out and thus increases the Frenchman's chances.
Manuel Fernandes - CAM - OVR 80
There were a few high scoring games in Russia this week and none were more exciting than CSKA's encounter with Spartak Moscow which saw they away side coming away with a 4-3 win. Fernandes was the player that stood out scoring one and assisting another two of CSKA's four goals, claiming MOTM in the process.
Paul Pogba - CM - OVR 88
Either Pogba or Bailly could make their way into TOTW 49 but I am opting for the Frenchman who continued an impressive start to the season with a goal and two assists during United's 4-0 win over Swansea City.
Christian Pulisic - CAM - OVR 74
All the talk is surrounding Dembele at Dortmund but Pulisic could easily turn out to be just as good if not better than the Frenchman. At just 18 years of age the American continues to impress for Dortmund. He grabbed both a goal and assist during a 3-0 over Wolfsburg on Saturday claiming a 1.5 in the process.
Forwards
Mauro Icardi - ST - OVR 84
Inters top goal scorer last season started this one off with a bang scoring two of their three goals in a convincing 3-0 home win over Fiorentina. Should he pick up the IF on Wednesday it will be his fifth of the year showing just how dominant he has been.
Jonas - ST - OVR 84
Talking of players with several IF's already we now move onto Jonas who has accumulated five special items thus far. Come Wednesday I can guarantee you it will become six after the Brazilian scored three and picked up an assist during Benfica's 5-0 win.
Substitutes
Jack Butland - GK - OVR 82
Butland had proved just what he was made of pre injury but the question was after so long out would he be able to replicate that form. If the Arsenal game is anything to go by the answer is yes, The England international made a total of six saves as Stoke shocked Arsenal with a 1-0 home win.
Graham Zusi - RB - OVR 71
Zusi occupied an unusual RB role for Kansas this weekend but he performed well, not only helping them to keep a clean sheet but also contributing to both their goals, providing the assist on both occasions. Not many non-gold defenders performed and thus it only increases Zusi's chances of selection.
Connor Hourihane - CM - OVR 69
It goes from bad to worse for Norwich who picked up yet another 0 points after their away trip to Villa Park ended in a 4-2 defeat. Irish midfielder, Hourihane was the stand out player scoring three of the four host goals which surely results in an IF for him.
Matthew Leckie - RM - OVR 72
A very good silver item Leckie would become with an IF and considering that he claimed Bundesliga POTW after scoring both Hertha goals in their 2-0 home win the likelihood is that it will become a reality.
Yohan Boli - ST - OVR 67
Without silver or bronze hat tricks in contention it allows me to make a punt or two. Boli is exactly that but after a brace in a shock 3-2 win away at Anderlecht he makes his case for inclusion.
Christian Stuani- ST - OVR 72
Many people had written Girona off when they saw their opening fixture was to host Atletico Madrid but they impressed with a 2-2 draw and although they failed to get the win nothing can be taken away from that performance. Stuani was the man behind the goals scoring both of them and with it being an upset that will only help his case.
Goran Karadeniz - ST - OVR 75
There was no abundance of gold striker performances coming into this selection process, hence the sheer amount of them predicted. All deserve their spot though with Karadeniz picking up his one for a goal and three assists in a dominating 6-0 home win for Rubin Kazan.
Reserves
Aleksandar Kolarov - LB - OVR 79
Kolarov may well be getting towards the end of his career however Roma really have got a great player signed for at least a few more seasons. The Serbian started Italian life well scoring the only goal of the game ensuring the three points went to Roma when they travelled to Atalanta.
Suso - RW - OVR 80
With only a few options from Italy it is likely that a 50/50 shot from there could get the nod and thus I have gone with Suso. The Spaniard scored one and assisted another to pick up a 7.5 from Gazzetta as AC went on to pick up all three points.
Malcom - RM - OVR 76
There were a few options from this specific game with Bordeaux registering a 3-3 draw away at Lyon. It comes down to two options for me, one from either side with both Fekir and Malcom. I have gone for the latter as I personally feel that it is more impressive. The Brazilian scored twice, one of which came in the dying embers of the game to claim the point.
Vincent Aboubakar - ST - OVR 78
A second Portuguese league striker now and much like Jonas it also comes after a hat trick. This one came in Porto's 3-0 home win with Aboubakar scoring all three of the said goals.
Victor Ibarbo - ST - OVR 75
The main man himself ends this week’s prediction after managing a brace and assist in Tosu's 3-0 home win. So now you can wait for the Ibarbo and Podolski line ups hitting your screen several times during the final chapter of FIFA 17."

FIFA Mobile's Team of the Season 2017 has just about come to a head.
Following this evening's game data deploy, the upgraded Serie A (aka ""Calcio A"") Team of the Season item plans are officially in the wild and with them, we now know the full FIFA Mobile TOTS.
Joining the previously released 19 upgraded blue items are:

96 CAM Radja Nainggolan
95 ST Dries Mertens
95 GK Gianluigi Buffon
94 CB Kalidou Koulibaly

As OP as the 92 ST TOTS Mertens was, just imagine this new 95 item -- and perhaps even a hypothetical 97 or 98-rated version.
The Ultimate Upgrade token needing FIFA Mobile Ultimate Team of the Season is expected to be released this Friday, June 23 at 6 p.m. BST/1 p.m. ET. The specifics of the plans necessary to get some of the best untradeable items in this year's Mobile game are still in the ether, but you should expect to need at least 1 Ultimate Upgrade token for a 97, 2 for a 98, and 3 for a 99.
We'll see what the plans entail for Mobile TOTS' grand finale."

As we reach the midway point of this August Community Team of the Week plans, we have another interesting set of players.
This week’s winner was Daniel of Royals, but as he already has a TOTW in his name, the cTOTW goes to Hall of Fame member Pang, who has been there or thereabouts for a few weeks now and finished just 7,000 fans short of Daniel. As has become customary, Pang changed their team to feature a number of past and present Arsenal players, along with a wide variety of bronze and silver players to make the TOTW that bit more interesting. 
The Master Player for this week is going to be a popular one for sure, as the ‘American Messi’ himself, Christian Pulisic of Borussia Dortmund, gets a 96 rated card. With boosts of +1 Dribbling and +1 Short Passing to all, he would he a great addition to many teams as he gets an upgrade to his already amazing 4th July card. Not to forget the big upgrades coming to five bronze and silver players who have made it, there are sure to be plenty of good cards to use, and hopefully a bit cheaper than last week!
The full team this week is:
82 GK Emiliano Martínez
83 LB Héctor Hernández
88 CB Javier Mascherano
81 CB Terell Thomas
82 RWB Ainsley Maitland-Niles
83 LM Alex Iwobi
96 CAM Christian Pulisic -- Master Player
85 CM Bogdan Stanciu 
91 CDM Toni Kroos
90 ST Zhang Yuning
90 ST Robin van Persie"

Boxing Day feels like so long ago with the grinding that took place as a result of the Freeze and New Year promos, but we finally have another set of Matchup fixtures to predict.
One change which has been kept from the previous set of fixtures is the offer of Skill Boosts as a reward if you fail to get enough tokens for the reward player, or simply decide that you don’t need or want them.
This week’s reward is a very tasty one though, as LW Douglas Costa has been unleashed. With plenty of pace and dribbling, he looks like a great option for anyone who didn’t get the Top Transfer Neymar card last year, and wants a LW for their team to use regularly or for future Icon campaigns.
So, let’s get into this weeks games.

Fiorentina v Inter Milan
Serie A was the only big league apart from the Premier League not to take a winter break, so it makes sense that it features heavily in this week's matchups while the EPL teams play in the FA Cup this weekend. Probably the biggest of those games is Fiorentina v Inter Milan, which sees 8th host 3rd. 
That may look like it's going to be a fairly comfortable game for Inter, but if you look at the teams in a bit more detail, it's anything but that. Since drawing 0-0 away to Juventus on 9th December, Inter have managed just 1 win in 5 games, and even that was an extra time cup win over Pordenone - a team currently playing in Serie C. That run has seen them drop yo third in the table and 7 points off the pace. Losses to Udinese, Sassuolo and then AC Milan in the cup were followed by a 0-0 draw against Lazio just before New Year. On the other hand, Fiorentina have lost just once in their last 9 games but have also drawn 5 of those games. 
In the previous 4 games to between these sides, the home side has triumphed, with Inter winning just 2 of the previous 7. There hasn't been a draw between them since 2012, but I believe that run could be coming to an end this week.
Game played: Friday 5th, 7:45pm GMT/2:45pm EST 
My prediction: Draw

Cagliari v Juventus
Unlike the first match, this should be a fairly easy one to predict. Cagliari host Juventus with both teams having very different seasons.
15th place Cagliari haven’t beaten Juventus since 2009, and have only won 1 of their last 7 games this season. They beat Atalanta last week, and when they have won previously this season, they won 3 in a row and then 3 in 4 games, so fans of the hosts should have some hope that they may be able to pull off a shock result.
Juventus are keep close tabs on Napoli, waiting to capitalise on any mistake that the league leaders may make. With just two league losses this season in the league, and only 2 dropped points from the past 24 available. However they are missing Buffon and Pjanic, but should have more than enough strength in depth to manage.
This should be a comfortable win for the visitors, with Cagliari probably not causing too many problems.
Game played: Saturday 6th, 7:45pm GMT/2:45pm EST 
My prediction: Juventus win

Sporting CP v Maritimo
Another easy game on paper is the game between Sporting and Matirimo. At the time of writing, Sporting are second in the league behind Porto on goal difference, with both sides still undefeated in the league. Sporting last dropped points in the league back at the start of November, and with their goal difference being 10 worse than Porto’s, they will be hoping to gain some of that back in games like this.
Maritimo suffered defeat on either side of the league winter break, losing 3-1 to Porto and then 2-1 to Chaves, but a draw and a win in the Cup either side of Christmas should give them some confidence going into this game, but I can’t see it being enough for them to avoid defeat against Sporting.
Game played: Sunday 7th, 6:00pm GMT/1:00pm EST 
My prediction: Sporting win

Celta Vigo v Real Madrid
Real Madrid find themselves in the unusual position of 4th after the winter break, and a massive 14 points off the pace after tasting defeat in El Clasico just before Christmas. Although they do have a game in hand against Leganes, a win by 3 or more goals would only see them move up to 3rd in the table and 11 points behind Barcelona, but that is probably a bit too large of a difference for even them to recover.
Celta Vigo had a tough run of fixtures going into the short break, with games against Barcelona, Valencia and Villarreal causing their season to stall slightly. Drawing 2-2 then losing 2-1 and 1-0 in those games shows they are not to be underrated, and they could cause a struggling Real Madrid some problems.
Real have won the majority of the games between these two recently, but Celta have had some good results, such as a 2-1 away followed by a 2-2 draw just over a year ago as they knocked Real out of the Copa del Rey. However, I think Real will edge them this time, as they will be desperate to make amends for their loss to Barcelona. 
Game played: Sunday 7th, 7:45pm GMT/2:45pm EST 
My prediction: Real Madrid win

That’s what I think will happen this week, what about you? Let us know on twitter and in the comments below!
Remember that every correct result matters now, as you can trade in 1 token for 40 skill boosts, or 4 tokens for 250!"

Team of the Week is back on point.
After a long hard summer of MLS, Russian League, and the best in-forms South America has to offer, the big boys are back in town, with the return of the Premier League. 
The barrier to entry for this TOTW, as is often the case late in the life of a FIFA release, is maybe not as picky as is customary throughout the rest of the game's natural progression. Accordingly, some one goal performances may be all it takes.
Wayne Rooney's Everton return just about couldn't have gone better. His quite solid (though perhaps unspectacular) afternoon of football earns him an 87-overall in-form. Christian Eriksen probably didn't have a traditional TOTW worthy performance, but as Man of the Match in Spurs' man up dismantling of PL returnees Newcastle, he gets a tasty 89-overall CAM IF. Manchester United's Henrikh Mkhitaryan steals a deserved in-form from newcomer Nemanja Matic, but I'm doubting few United backers will care after their emphatic showcase Sunday.
As if we hadn't buried the lede enough, Neymar gets a 97-overall PSG player item that while just slightly downgraded relative to his previous Barca 97 in-form, gives him one heck of a boost from his new 92 base transfer one. A top three individual item for a one goal and one assist debut. It's good to be Neymar.

You don’t have to go too far back in FIFA history to find the time when EA were championing Pro Clubs as the future of virtual football. Their mission at the time above all else, was to make 22 virtual pro’s the pinnacle of both the casual and competitive FIFA experience. A virtual World Cup with 32 real participating nations was even mooted at the time, as a sort of grand finale for FIFA’s latest innovation. So what the hell happened?
Well, Ultimate Team arrived and so did FIFA Seasons and after that, Pro Clubs slipped further down the pecking order year on year, to point where it was almost forgotten. In the last couple of years to give them some credit, EA have added some depth to Clubs with better customisation, skill trees and improved match-making. But there is still a long way to go from that early vision of what Pro Clubs could be. 
Practice Arena
One of the most difficult things to manage in Pro Clubs is the ability to practice as a team. Playing matches of course brings tactics together over time, but there isn’t really a clean sandbox to try things out either as a full eleven, or in smaller groups. Getting people to work together and co-ordinate in Clubs is a nightmare at the best of times and a scratch area to run through formations and positioning could be the key to unlocking a more realistic style of play across the board. It's something the hardcore Clubs community have been crying out for, for years and it would be a huge addition for FIFA 19. 
In fact, forget practicing, how about just being able to mess about playing headers and volleys? Sign me up. 
A Competitive Scene
Now apart from just enjoying Pro Clubs, for me there’s a real lack of reasons to play, or go through the trouble of getting a team together. There’s f course the FIFA Seasons leagues to try and top with your team but beyond that, why should people play Clubs instead of Ultimate Team, Career Mode or traditional FIFA Seasons?
One way to reignite Pro Clubs (along with other changes) would be for EA to offer a carrot for dedicated teams by hosting an official competition themselves. It doesn’t have to be a big fancy LAN like FUT Champions, but something official to get people engaged and excited about the Virtual Pro scene again. 
Pretty much all the organisation of Pro Clubs tournaments comes from outside the game right now and whilst that’s amazing, it’s also a shame EA don’t share that same passion the community do for the mode. If Clubs is ever going to reach the heights of its initial vision, EA need to step up and back it by bringing an official competative scene to the party for FIFA 19. 
Your Pro in FUT
Now the other way to increase engagement in Clubs would be to try and leverage some of the power of Ultimate Team. At the end of completing the Journey mode for example, one of the rewards you receive is an Alex Hunter item for FUT. Ok, it’s not the greatest thing in the world stats wise, but as a carrot to play the Journey and contribute to your early FUT squad it works quite well. 
So why not have the option to take our Virtual Pro’s in to FUT too? There are of course, lots of potential pitfalls with this idea around balancing, realism and not conceding to a 6’6 blue afro giant. But in the same vein as Alex Hunter, even a tokenistic reward could be enough to get people playing Clubs again. And right now, that's half the battle. 
Hit the comments with your own suggestions for FIFA 19 Pro Clubs!"

Two of the main leagues in Europe could have their title confirmed this weekend, with another two edging ever closer. With Bayern not quite able to get over the line last week due to Schalke also winning, we now turn to England to see if Manchester City can seal the league title against their most bitter of rivals. 
We also have the entertainment of the Madrid derby this weekend in what looks set to be a very good weekend of football.
So, let's get into this week's games.

Manchester City v Manchester United
We start with the most decisive game of the weekend, which could see Manchester City win the league at home against their closest rivals.
City suffered their first home loss of the season in their last game at the Etihad, when Basel came from behind to win 2-1 in their rather irrelevant Champions League Round of 16 second leg. That was just the second time that they have failed to win at home all season, with the other being a 1-1 draw with Everton back in their first home league game of the season. With 51 goals scored and just 10 conceded in their 15 home games so far this season, they are the best team in the league for home form. 
United have found a good run of form recently, only losing to Sevilla in the past two months. With solid wins over Swansea and Brighton helping build on their key wins over Chelsea and Liverpool, they are in good form coming into what will surely be their toughest game of the season. However, their away form has not really been as good, with losses against Newcastle and Spurs in their last five games. 
Head to head games between these two have been going either way, with two wins each and a draw in their last five meetings. City won the first meeting this season 2-1, the same scoreline as the previous season when the reverse result was 0-0. City have possibly the toughest run of games of the season, facing Liverpool in the Champions League three days on either side of this game, and then Spurs next weekend, they may take it easy in one of those games if they wish to keep competing for a treble.
Before last night’s result, I’d have thought that a City win was extremely likely, but with Liverpool running riot against them and coming out with a 3-0 advantage, it’s tough to say whether they may prioritise their Champions League second leg tie during the week over sealing the title against their rivals. However, they rested Sterling for a lot of that game, which may prove to be a big advantage against United’s well rested and well organised defence. Another key matter may be whether Sergio Aguero has managed to recover enough to be fit enough to play.
Honestly, this game is going to be impossible to predict until the lineups are out, and even then it may still be too close to call. I’m going with a draw, purely as I can’t find a way to separate the two teams ahead of seeing the team sheets, and I would recommend waiting as long as possible to predict this game, in case any news of Aguero comes out which may make the outcome a bit more obvious.
Game played: Saturday 7th, 5:30 p.m. (BST) / 12:30 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw

Real Madrid v Atletico Madrid
The Madrid derby is always a very tough game, with both teams wanting to take home the bragging rights, as well as a valuable three points. This time round, it’s even more important to take home three points, with Real having recovered from their shocking start to the season to now sit just four points behind their rivals.
Real Madrid come into the game on a massive high, having the joint best attack in the league and having convincingly beaten Juventus in their Champions League first leg 3-0 thanks to a Ronaldo wonder goal. With just one loss in their last 12 games - a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Espanyol - they are in excellent form. And with two wins over PSG in that run, as well as the win over Juventus, they are showing the world why they are one of the best teams in the world.
Atletico have also been on a very strong run of form, losing 2-1 to Villarreal and Barcelona 1-0 as their only dropped points in their last 14 games. They face a tough clash against Sporting in the Europa League on Thursday night, before a game where they will be trying to keep ahead of their city rivals. Perhaps most impressively, they are the only team in Europe to have kept a better defensive record than Barcelona this season, averaging just one goal conceded every 193 minutes played. Away from home, they have lost only three games this season, but those three have all come in their last six games, so they may not be in the best of form on their travels.
Recent games between these two have been very even, with three wins each and six draws in the last 12 ties. With Real at home, things are not much clearer with the record also being W3 D6 L3 in the last 12 games played. This game is very tough to call, but I feel that Real’s incredible run of form will help carry them to victory.
Game played: Sunday 8th, 3:15 p.m. (BST) / 10:15 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Real Madrid win

Sampdoria v Genoa
In the third local derby of the week, we have the ‘Derby della Lanterna’ which pits Sampdoria and Genoa against themselves in the stadium the two share, in a proper mid-table clash.
Sampdoria are the ‘home’ side this time, and are very confident playing at home, with the fourth best home record in the league ahead of the likes of Lazio, AC Milan and Roma. However, their recent run has seen them lose four of their last six games, conceding 14 in that time, which will not inspire much confidence. In Fabio Quagliarella, they have the joint third best scorer in the league, whose goals have helped his team pick up an extra 15 points so far this season. However, he may face a late fitness test ahead of the game, having picked up an injury which forced him out of their game against Atalanta last week.
Genoa’s form at the stadium hasn’t been as impressive as their opponents, having picked up just 15 points from 15 games. In recent weeks, they’ve won a couple of tough games, but with five losses and two draws in their last nine, they are in very poor form and have only scored four games in those games.
In recent years, results have swung both ways when Sampdoria are the ‘home’ side, but it is Sampdoria who have had a strong run of six wins out of their last eight against their city rivals, and I feel like that run will continue as they get another win.
Game played: Saturday 7th, 7:45 p.m. (BST) / 2:45 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Sampdoria win

Heerenveen v Groningen
The ‘Derby of the North’ in the Netherlands take place as 8th place Heerenveen host 14th place Groningen. In a game more about bragging rights than anything else, both teams have chance to get a get one up on their nearest rivals.
Hosts Heerenveen are still keeping up hope of sneaking into the Europa League qualification playoffs, sitting just three points off the last spot and seeming to be in a five-way battle for the last two spots as the league heads into the final five games. With only one game of their final five being left against a team higher in the league than them, they will be hoping for a good win try and equal their season best run of three games in a row unbeaten.
Groningen went on a good run of three games unbeaten to help them move clear of the relegation zone, before narrow losses against Ajax and AZ Alkmaar put a stop to that run. With just one win since the winter break, they are in pretty awful form, but will be hoping that their vastly superior goal difference can help keep them clear if they happen to fall back into poor form after those two losses. 
In an interesting season, Heerenveen have gained more points on the road than at home this season, while Groningen have managed just one win in 14 attempts on the road. The last two games between these sides has ended in stalemate, with the past six games being W2 D2 L2, so it’s safe to say they are pretty tough to split.
I feel like Heerenveen’s solid form in recent weeks, along with Groningen’s awful away form this season, should sway the game towards the home side so I’m going with a narrow victory for the hosts, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it ends as a tie.
Game played: Sunday 8th, 1:30 p.m. (BST) / 8:30 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Heerenveen win

That’s what I think might happen this week, with good mix of games to try and predict this week. As a reward, you can pick yourself up an 85 Overall RW Martin Ødegaard, or some ever important training XP to help you boost your team.
As always, good luck and happy predicting!"

TOTS is in full swing on console and now it's time for FIFA Mobile to join the party.
Starting today (19th of May) and running until the 3rd of July, TOTS on FIFA Mobile will concentrate on the five major leagues, Germany, Spain, Italy, England and France, and will feature the same starting 11 and 12 reserves for each squad as their console counterparts, although the ratings may differ slightly. As you'd expect, there will be a packed TOTS program, which will centre around the leagues startes and reserves. 
The format will be the same through the first 5 weeks, focusing on the active team for that week, you can use league specific players and TOTS tokens to unlock players from the starting 11 or the reserves of that week's TOTS. There will be plans available revolving around the starting 11 which grants a starting 11 player and an upgrade token used later, and the reserves, which grants a reserve player but no upgrade token. It will however be possible to find starting 11 players via the reserve plan. The players available throught this part of the event will all be tradeable and all TOTS players will boost other players from their league.

Week 6 will be the Overall Team of the Season, featuring players from all five leagues. The players that make up this team will be upgradable using the upgrade tokens earned across weeks 1-5.
The FIFA Mobile Team will be tracking the most popular plans across week 6 and boil them down into the Ultimate TOTS for week 7, these 11 players will be able to be upgraded a second time.
Each new TOTS will be announced on Fridays at 6pm UK time, 10am Pacific.
So that's TOTS for FIFA Mobile in a nutshell. Plenty of details still tbd including stats, but it's going to be a busy 7 weeks for F2P players."

Market Overview
A rather tame week for the FIFA Ultimate Team market in general, but that was to be expected after the whirlwind that was the Ones to Watch promotion. Everyone seemed to be catching their breath, and as a result prices only fluctuated a little with a general upward trend after this Weekend League. A couple of League SBC added a little hype to the market, but soon enough it’ll all be Lunar New Year hype. 
Our dynamic Path to Glory items fared better after their enormous dip just a week ago. A mixed bag of returns for players across the board, but a seemingly reasonable trend that we’ll try to unpack below.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  Although Alejandro Gomez and Kingsley Coman had a weekly return of zero, their High/Low ranges were noticeably high. With such a large difference it might be beneficial to ear mark these items for future investments cause they clearly have hype potential.
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take: No outrageous volatility figures this week, but that was to be expected due to surrounding market conditions. That being said, still pay attention to the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Marco Asensio and Raphael Varane whose numbers reflect a possible positive price swing next week! 
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of a card to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: An interesting assortment of beta figures this week, gives us something unprecedented to talk about. Lots of high numbers that are both positive and negative. This diversity demonstrates quite a lot of risk in the PTG market. Players similar to Danny Welbeck and Marcus Rashford should be approached with caution, while Sandro Wagner and Marquinhos could present a lttle better reward for the risk.
TOTW Shout 
Only one big one this week with the Sporting midfielder William Carvalho claiming a goal in his weekend tie. Hopefully he features because that will really solidify him being a winner after we've picked on him for a few weeks! 
Big Winner - William Carvalho (Sporting Lisbon)
Hmm… Is it just a coincidence that more often than not our previous week’s biggest loser turns into a big winner? Well we are going to chalk that up to us knowing how to pick 'em. Last week William Carvalho’s price was in a free fall, but after a tidy weekend performance he has skyrocketed earning the biggest winner spot. 
Huge volatility (5,5000) and beta (2.82) figures for the defensive midfielder are definitely a product of hype; however, they also provide an interesting insight for the future. With both of these risk metrics really high, we recommend looking to offload Carvalho now if possible. Selling into the hype protects against the risk of him missing out on the TOTW, and also helps against the drop in price dynamic items face even after an upgrade.  

So, yeah our synopsis of Carvalho was a little pessimistic looking forward, but in these type of situations it's definitely better to be safe than sorry. Look to sell into that hype, but if you bought him last week when he was a big loser than you are the true big winner!
Big Loser - Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Liverpool)
Just like Liverpool, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has seen his fair share of ups and downs this season. Unfortunately for him, this week is one of those downs as he finds himself as the biggest loser. A tough week for his price sees him down 23.9%, but there’s a little more to unpack in order to see the whole picture. 
We touched on his high volatility before (~7,000), but the Ox is sporting a low negative beta (-0.24) that we haven’t seen before. A negative beta is not anything scary it just means his price swing will be in the inverse direction of where the overall market goes, nut also not that small figure means it won’t be too large regardless. Putting the two together, it seems like Alex’s volatility pints to a high price hype potential, while the low beta means he might have hit his bottom price.

So, with the preceding point in mind, coupled with a busy fixture list for Liverpool going forward (UCL matches), it might be beneficial to pick up an Ox if he fits in your team. 
Recap
Considering it was a tame week in the overall FUT market, the PTG sector seems to have a little flair after digging into it. A solid week for the mid-tier PTG items speaks well to them holding value for the near future, but long term if an item is not performing its price is going to drop like a rock. Hopefully, we’ll see these used for a SBC at some point (maybe closer to the World Cup), but be weary of Lunar New Year on the horizon.             

Let us know your thoughts on the Path to Glory market below! Also, at some point do you think we’ll see a second batch of these items?

EA teased it yesterday. Today they delievered.
In the latest (and ostensibly one of if not the final) FIFA 18 trailers before launch at the end of September, EA (with a little help from DJ and master YouTube remixer Mike Relm) pump out a funky dance remix of New Order's ""Blue Monday"" over supercuts of 18 gameplay/action. The usual suspects are all there: coverstar Ronaldo in the a brand new Real Madrid shirt; Neymar in his PSG best; and of course, it wouldn't be a FIFA promo without a dabbing Paul Pogba.
Unsurprisingly, after FUT Live's MLS All-Star Game debut, there isn't exactly a ton of new functionality or features to showcase. But whether you got a chance to get a couple weeks in with the FIFA 18 Closed Beta or not, it's hard not to be pretty excited for September 26 (or 20 if you're on Xbox One with EA Access).
Check out the trailer in all its glory and let us know your thoughts in the comments below:

            Updated on
            



With the FIFPro awards being moved to October instead of January, EA have decided to switch things up this year for Team of the Year. A number of different community influencers, media outlets, and professional athletes have been given the chance to help decide who gets one of the highest rated player items in the game. And as part of that, we’re giving you, the community, a say in who gets in Team of the Year.
The players are chosen from a shortlist of 55 players, and will be released in the traditional 4-3-3 formation.
From this shortlist, I have picked out the XI who I feel are the most likely to make it into the Team of the Year, but also deserve their spot, to try and provide some insight before you make your important vote. 
Without further ado, let's get into the team.

David De Gea
Games Played: 51
Record: W30 D13 L8
Clean Sheets: 27
Goals Conceded: 36
Awards/Trophies won: Europa League, EFL Cup, PFA Goalkeeper of the Year 
The number of people who rate the Spaniard as the best keeper in the world seems to be growing on a daily basis. With Manuel Neuer out injured for most of this season and omitted from the shortlist, De Gea seems like the perfect and most deserving candidate to end the German superstar’s run of four Team of the Year cards in a row.
He added to his growing hardware collection with an EPL Cup and Europa League winners medal with Manchester United, along with being named in the PFA Team of the Year for the third consecutive year personally, 
Now the only real question that remains is whether Neuer is able to get back into the TOTY ahead of the Spaniard. Or will this begin the reign of a new keeper in the Team of the Year, with De Gea becoming just the fifth keeper to make it into the FIFPro World XI after Dida, Gianluigi Buffon, Iker Casillas and Neuer.

Marcelo
Games Played: 55
Record: W37 D9 L9
Clean Sheets: 18
Goals Conceded: 59
Goals: 5
Assists: 15
Awards/Trophies won: La Liga winner, Champions League winner, Club World Cup winner, Supercopa De España winner, UEFA Super Cup winner, FIFPro World XI member
Despite getting what some may describe as an undeserved TOTY in FIFA 15, there is no doubt that the Brazilian is the best left back of the past couple of years. He has been in good form this year as well, amassing an impressive 15 assists to help Real win five titles this year. 
How he is voted for in the influencer/public vote may vary quite a lot, but he should rank highly for EA, which should make him very likely to get into the TOTY. 

Sergio Ramos
Games Played: 60
Record: W42 D9 L9
Clean Sheets: 19
Goals Conceded: 64
Goals: 11
Assists: 7
Awards/Trophies won: La Liga winner, Champions League winner, Club World Cup winner, Supercopa De España winner, UEFA Super Cup winner, FIFPro World XI member
As always, Sergio Ramos should be one of the players who features in the Team of the Year. He featured in the FIFPro World XI for a seventh year in a row after helping Real Madrid to complete yet another very successful year.
With his combination of pace and all-round defensive stats makes him a must have for anyone fortunate enough to pack him, or capable of buying him.

Gérard Piqué
Games Played: 54
Record: W39 D10 L5
Goals Scored: 2
Assists: 0
Clean Sheets: 24
Goals Conceded: 44
Awards/Trophies won: Copa Del Rey winner 
Having missed out on the FIFPro World XI to Bonucci and Dani Alves, I believe that Piqué should gain his place it in the EA Team of the Year due to how dominant Barcelona have been in the first part of the 2017/18 season.
Barcelona look set to regain the La Liga title already, boasting a large lead over their nearest challengers. Having gone undefeated since losing both legs of the Super Cup to Real Madrid in August, no one seems capable of beating Barça this season. 
I believe that Piqué and Dani Alves will be fighting for the last defenders spot in the Team of the Year, with Alves the favourite if people vote based on the positions available in the 4-3-3 formation, and Piqué more likely to make the cut if it is based on performances and the ‘strict’ positions of the formation are ignored as they have been in the past.

Leonardo Bonucci
Games Played: 62
Record: W36 D13 L13
Clean Sheets: 28
Goals Conceded: 61
Goals Scored: 4
Assists: 1
Awards/Trophies won: Serie A winner, Coppa Italia winner, Champions League runner up, FIFPro World XI
The Italian centre back has been one of the most notable exclusions from the Team of the Year in the past couple of seasons. But having been named in the FIFPro World XI, I believe that this will be his time to make it into the FUT Team of the Year. 
At Juventus, he was a part of one of the best defences in Italy. But since his rather surprising move to AC Milan over summer, he has been relatively struggling, with rumours of him wanting to leave becoming increasingly common.
He should be a popular choice after missing out last year, but I believe that, if it was based solely on performances, he would not be included and someone like Pique would take his place. However, with him being named in the FIFPro World XI, it should make him even more likely as he should gather votes from both the influencers and EA. 

Luka Modrić
Games Played: 55
Record: W37 D7 L11
Goals Scored: 2
Assists: 7
Awards/Trophies won: La Liga winner, Champions League winner, Club World Cup winner, Supercopa De España winner, UEFA Super Cup winner, FIFPro World XI member
The Croatian star has had another successful year which saw him finish fifth in the Ballon d’Or voting. As always, he has played a crucial role in Real Madrid’s midfield, offering attacking creativity to support Real’s outstanding attackers. 
Not only has he been successful with Real, but he has captained Croatia to their second consecutive World Cup finals thanks to a solid second place finish in the group stage and a comfortable win over Greece in the playoffs.
He should be almost guaranteed a spot in the TOTY, but with players like De Bruyne having had excellent showings in recent months, he may be a surprise omission from it in favour of someone like the Belgian.

Toni Kroos
Games Played: 56
Record: W37 D10 L9
Goals Scored: 5
Assists: 12
Awards/Trophies won: La Liga winner, Champions League winner, Club World Cup winner, Supercopa De España winner, UEFA Super Cup winner, FIFPro World XI member
The German international has had another fantastic season for Real Madrid, being one of the main creative forces behind their five titles this year. At just 28 years old, he is just getting into the prime of his career so expect him to be a mainstay in Team of the Year squads for the next few years at least.
His pace may not make him an attractive card for many FUT player, but with an Engine, Hunter, Catalyst or Shadow chemistry style, he becomes a reasonably fast beast of a centre midfielder.
Whether both Modrić and Kroos make it into the TOTY is something I am not 100% sure about, but I expect at least one of them to make it, with Kroos the more likely of the two to miss out.

N’Golo Kanté
Games Played: 54
Record: W37 D7 L10
Goals Scored: 2
Assists: 1
Awards/Trophies won: Premier League winner, French Player of the Year
Having been a shocking omission from last year's TOTY, I believe that he is very likely to make it into the TOTY this time round. Winning a second consecutive Premier League title, this time with Chelsea, he has shown that his form with Leicester was not just a one season wonder. Finishing 8th in the Ballon d'Or list shows just how good he has been and how he has gone from zero to hero in just a couple of years. 
As a big FUT favourite in the Weekend League, he should gain a lot of support from both the influencers and EA, further increasing his chances of getting in. He may have lost some form and not been able to quite reach his level from the past two seasons, but he should almost be a certainty for a TOTY card now.

Cristiano Ronaldo
Games Played: 60
Record: W42 D7 L11
Goals Scored: 53
Assists: 13
Awards/Trophies won: La Liga winner, Champions League winner, Club World Cup winner, Supercopa De España winner, UEFA Super Cup winner, Ballon d'Or winner, FIFPro World XI member
Despite him having a poor start to the 2017/18 season, by his standards anyway, his place in the Team of the Year is beyond any sort of doubt. His fifth Ballon d'Or won was the icing on the cake for yet another incredible year.

Harry Kane
Games Played: 52
Record: W33 D9 L10
Goals Scored: 56
Assists: 10
Awards/Trophies won: PFA Fans Player of the Year, Premier League Golden Boot, Most goals in 2017
The final difference I have for my team is Harry Kane getting in ahead Neymar. The English striker’s goals won Spurs an amazing 26 extra points in the league; seven in the Champions League; and five extra points for England in European qualification. 
With the TOTY being voted for by the community, and a significant portion of FUT players either being English or fans of the EPL, I feel that Kane is likely to make it ahead of Neymar.

Lionel Messi
Games Played: 64
Record: W45 D12 L7
Goals Scored: 54
Assists: 16
Awards/Trophies won: Copa Del Rey winner, European Golden Shoe, Ballon d'Or runner-up, FIFPro World XI member
Our last player should also come as no surprise. Messi has helped Barcelona to an amazing 14 point lead going into the winter break in La Liga. It may have been a quiet year in terms of silverware and awards, but there is no denying that he deserves a place on the TOTY. 

OTHER OPTIONS
Dani Alves
Games Played: 47
Record: W35 D7 L5
Goals Scored: 8
Assists: 11
Clean Sheets: 26
Goals Conceded: 32
Replacement for: Piqué
Awards/Trophies won: Serie A winner, Coppa Italia winner, Champions League runner up, Trophée des Champions winner, FIFPro World XI
A player who caused outrage when he was named in the 2013 Team of the Year is Dani Alves, after he was named in the FIFPro World XI ahead of the likes of Jerome Boateng, Diego Godín, and David Alaba. Since then, there has been little doubt that he has deserved his places in subsequent Team of the Years.
One thing that may go against him is the fact that he has had to share the RB slot at both Juventus and PSG, with Lichtsteiner and Meunier respectively, resulting in him not being given as much game time as many of the other TOTY nominees.
Although he was named in the FIFPro World XI this year, it may be the first since 2014 that he misses out on a Team of the Year card, as I believe that he will face very strong competition from his former teammate Gérard Piqué. Depending on whether those voting opt for a standard 4-3-3 formation with a LB and RB, or just pick four defenders, Alves may be the one to miss out despite helping Juventus to a sixth consecutive Serie A title and linking up with his former club mate Neymar at PSG.
Kevin De Bruyne
Games Played: 61
Record: W48 D9 L4
Goals Scored: 10
Assists: 26
Awards/Trophies won: Top Assister in the Premier League
Replacement for: Modrić or Kroos
The Belgian midfielder is arguably the best playmaker in the world right now, with his incredible vision, range of passing, awareness and also his ability to finish as well. He finished last season as the top assister in the Premier League, and is currently the joint top assister this season with his teammate Leroy Sane.
However, he did miss out on the FIFPro awards shortlist, which makes me thing that he will also miss out on the TOTY as people may not be expecting him to make it and have already decided who they want to vote for. 

Neymar
Games Played: 55
Record: W42 D7 L6
Goals Scored: 34
Assists: 30
Awards/Trophies won: Copa Del Rey winner, most expensive transfer fee, FIFPro World XI member
Replacement for: Kane
Neymar is a player who has divided opinions among many due to his decision to leave Barcelona for PSG, but there is no doubting his talent. With 64 goal contributions in 55 games, he has the second best ratio of the four player I believe are candidates for an attacker spot in the TOTY, and by far the most assists.
His big money move to PSG may have raised some eyebrows, but with him being in the FIFPro Team of the Year, I believe that he has a very good chance of getting in the TOTY for FUT.
However, with a large amount of the FUT player-base being fans of the EPL, I can see Harry Kane sneaking in ahead of him, for the reasons which I have stated above.

That is the XI that I expect to make it into the Team of the Year, along with a few potential alternatives. Hopefully it helps provide some insight and more detailed information on some of the best candidates ahead of you casting your ballot."

Market Overview
Over the course of the week, the FUT market has continued to hold relatively stable in spite of uncertainty around big promotions. It seems EA are going to hold off on Team of the Knockout stage until after FUT Swap. Regardless, the market is hanging on threads before a crash as Team of the Season approaches, so if you are looking at profit on your cards, now might be the time to take it. 
In terms of the Ones to Watch market, players' prices continue to hold steady and many rose over the week. We love to see this because it speaks to the items’ value going forward, but make sure to note that once domestic seasons end these cards become much less useful; therefore, their prices crash. With a month left there is definitely still profit to be made, but keep reading to see how to maximize your coins in the coming weeks. 
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats



The graphs above are concise overviews of all the keypoints from the data that I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:   With domestic seasons winding down, its time to start focusing on low price, high hype potential individuals who get solid game time. So, looking at some high/low spread players like Aymeric Laporte, Davinson Sanchez and Theo Walcott fit the bill. 

Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take:  Some pretty high volatility figures this week, and it mirrors the Path to Glory sector that we touched on earlier this week. The high figures here provide insight into the fact that the market is in a very uncertain state. That being said, if you like riding risk high volatility player like Michy Batshuayi, Serge Aurier and Kylian Mbappe look like high risk/high reward options.

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Another week of mixed figures here, but that speaks to some players being more risky than others. Yet, sticking to our high hype potential individuals, players like Gylfi Sigurdsson, Diego Costa and Leonardo Bonucci have betas point to big price jumps if they can bag a goal. 
TOTW Shout
No concrete Team of the Week shouts this week, but that being said there are some Team of the Knockout Stage performances that deserve our consideration. Liverpool soared through their UCL ties against Manchester City, and both Virgil Van Dijk and Mohamed Salah could be in line to make the TOTKS side. 
In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner - Virgil Van Dijk (Liverpool)
Milot Rashica sports a high weekly return, but it's important to note that since his price is low any slight increase looks big in terms of percents. Also, with not too much hype this week, we want to cover a player mentioned above more in-depth. So, Virgil Van Dijk is this week's biggest winner.
The Liverpool defender had a quality week in terms of price increase, but we want to stress our recommendation based on his outlook. As OTW players reach the end of their domestic season it is important to take profit whenever you can get it. Coins will be extremely valuable around TOTS considering we are primed for a market crash. This will give you substantial buying power, so our advice is to sell Van Dijk into the hype and look to other OP options around TOTS. 

Big Loser - Leonardo Bonucci (AC Milan)
We don’t usually choose a biggest loser from players we’ve mentioned above; however, even after our 23rd article there’s still room for first time occurrences. That being said, our biggest loser this week is Leonardo Bonucci, yet is he truly a big loser?
With a -13.7% return Bonucci had a week to forget; however, his volatility and beta are middling figures. That combination of stars point to the fact that his card should be at its bottom. Going forward don’t expect his price to drop much, so if you’re a Milan fan it might be a good look to pick up a few on open bid. Be patient to get the best price. 
The ex-Juventus CB presents an interesting case that a lot of high rated OTW items are facing at the moment. Right now there are still a few chances to get an upgrade, but in the next couple of weeks, if no opportunity has presented itself these items will begin to plummet. That means put profit to the front of your mind, and don’t hold out for a few extra coins.

Recap & outlook
The FUT market continues to remain in its limbo of steady prices, but underlying players are uncertain. The market is poised for a big drop with the release of the next big pack promo, so it is time to considerer going liquid for Team of the Season. You’ll have to be patient, but you can buy your players back then. Ones to Watch items are nearing their terminal point in FU, yet sticking to low price high hype potential players can still make you serious coin. Profit is now a priority, and here are a couple final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Prices are all over the place, but get in low on open bid . .     

-- OTW investors: It's getting pretty late in the game, but stick to the players in the 18-30k range as your best bets.  

OTW Neymar making waves at FUT Champs Manchester, any other OTW items you’d love to see on the competitive stage?

Wednesday the 24th of May see's the end of Attack Mode in FIFA Mobile as we know it, with some core changes coming in an update and name change to VS Attack. As discussed recently, the requirements for the set of Masters players for May was reduced to one token, from 2, to allow people to make the most of the elongated current season, and once that's done, we move onwards and upwards with a replacement in VS Attack.
Here's everything you need to know about VS Attack:

It completely replaces the old Attack Mode
Players will now matchmake with other users using an all new Elo system (opponents found based on similar Fan count)
Both players will play against the opponent’s AI, at the same time (no direct synchronous gameplay)
The score is updated in real-time for both players
You will will have the ability to send pre-canned emotes or messages to each other during the match
The game will be finished when both players have completed their turns.  No more half-completed Attack Mode Matches to worry about.
No large changes to way you earn fans and climb leaderboards and divisions.
A completely new reward system.


At the moment each season will now run for a week, although that may change based on feedback, meaning you'll be able to claim your prizes weekly to begin with.
So some positive changes that should remove some of the frustration of seeing ""too many matches"" over and over again with matches timing out quickly and an emote system that, despite no doubt being quite tame, users will quickly find a way to wind each other up with.
Perhaps the most important change though, changes to matchmaking and who you'll match up with.
In terms of rewards things are starting to lean towards the system used in plans. You'll still earn division tokens based on the division you finish in, which will allow you to claim players, but for every win in VS attack you'll also earn a victory token, which can then be used to upgrade those players further.
For the full run down check out EA's post."

Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad Link:http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/6956732/

Goalkeeper
Dani Hernandez - GK - 72 OVR
Tenerife entered the second leg losing 1-0 but after managing to win the second 1-0 eventually went on to advance in the Seguna Division playoffs. Hernandez played a huge role in this, making a total of 8 saves in the return fixture to help keep his clean sheet.
Defenders
Lee Jae-sung - CB - 67 OVR
I almost missed the K-League fixtures, and although there were not many options, I have selected a couple from them. The first of which is Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors' Lee Jae-sung, who scored one of three goals in a 3-0  win.
Hannu Patronen - CB - 65 OVR
The Finnish league is often overlooked due to being a one-team league primarily made up of silver players. Hannu Patronen has a chance though after picking up a goal in HJK's 2-0 win.
Mauricio Romero - CB - 69 OVR
With it being one of only a few leagues in action, the Argentine division looks set to pick up a fair few informs. Another of those is Mauricio Romero after he scored the only goal in Gimnasia's 1-0 away win.
Midfielders
Macnelly Torres - CAM - 75 OVR
After losing their first leg 2-0, Nacional managed to bounce back convincingly with a 5-1 second leg win in the Primera A Apertura Finals. Torres picked up MOTM from the game after the Colombian midfielder grabbed both a goal and assist.
Fernando Gago - CM - 77 OVR
Golds will be coming few and far between now, so when Fernando Gago picked up both a goal and assist for Boca in their 4-0 win, he instantly became one of the easiest selections this week. 
Blerim Dzemaili - CM - 74 OVR
The first of three players over two sides that I have selected from Montreal's 3-3 draw with Orlando is Blerim Dzemaili. The Swiss midfielder scored one and assisted another. Considering that he already has a silver 74 IF, this would make him a gold card and thus increases his chances of selection this week significantly.
Matias Perez Garcia - RM - 75 OVR
There were a handful of players whom could be selected from the match between Lions and Impact. Garcia is one of those after the Argentine scored and assisted once during a 3-3 draw at home to Montreal.
Forwards
David Villa - ST - 82 OVR
I would imagine that this David Villa will come in as 87 rated rather than 90. However, regardless of that, he is likely to be the best player to feature in this side. The Spaniard scored both NYFC goals in a 2-1 win over defending champions Seattle Sounders.
Ignacio Piatti - ST - 79 OVR
Piatti was given a more advanced ST role this weekend and played a huge part in Montreal's 3-3 away draw with both two goals and an assist to his name.
Bradley Wright-Phillips - ST - ST OVR
A hat-trick of MLS strikers ends with BWP and although he failed to get a hat-trick himself, the two he did manage -- Red Bulls' first road goals since their season opener -- should be enough to see him pick up his first IF of the game.
Substitutes
Kim Yong-dae - GK - 66 OVR
EA could well shove a random gold keeper in the side. However with two deserving silver options, this is what I am opting for. Kim Yong-dae is the second of the two and the keeper saved a penalty along with making five other saves in Ulsan's 2-1 away win.
Christoffer Remmer - RWB - 64 OVR
There is some debate over the positioning of Christoffer Remmer with RWB, RM, and even CB being thrown around. What isn't up for debate is the fact he picked two assists in Molde's 3-0 win.
Fabian Sambueza - RM - 73 OVR
With the sheer lack of games available, I am turning to a mid-week Colombian fixture for this one. Fabian Sambueza picked up both assists for Deportivo in their 2-0 win over America.
Romain Alessandrini - CAM - 74 OVR
Alessandrini would have been a certainty for this side had he not have received a downgrade to a silver. Despite that, I still think he is in after picking up both a goal and an assist in Galaxy's 2-2 draw.
David McMillan - ST - 62 OVR
There are a few Irish STs within a shout this week and I fully expect one to get it. I opted for Dundalk's David McMillan, seeing as he was involved in a 6-0 win, and though teammate Ciaran Kilduff also scored twice in the match, he came on when the game was effectively already over.
Mariano Pavone - ST - 73 OVR
We end the Argentine IFs with a player who would have normally received one anyway. Pavone managed to find the net three times for Velez as they cruised to a 5-1 home win.
Jorge Molina - ST - 73 OVR
This one could well be classified as a Hero item after Molina was involved in both of Getafe's playoff matches scoring twice in the first before helping with an assist in their second to see them progress over Huesca."

Market Overview
Happy Lunar New Year to all our readers! With 2-for-1 pack promos here (and coin discounted ones out there as well), that should give the general FUT market some hype it desperately needed. Over the past week, the market held steady, even though many have feared this LNY promo would crash the market. Usually when big events like these are on the horizon, players tend to mass list their items delivering a “pre-event market crash”. 
Looking to the rest of the OTW market update, the big news this week is the inclusion of the new Winter items, doubling the player pool for our analysis. We see this as double the fun, but it also our goal to keep the article as concise as possible. With that in mind, this week seemed to be a marquee week in the OTW market with tons of Team of the Week shouts, and plenty of price corrections (mainly Winter items). 
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats



The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data that I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:   The difference between high/low prices is pretty large across the board this week, and this can be attributed to players’ prices declining heavily since the OTW promotion. In terms of some stand out players in this section, Romelu Lukaku, Theo Walcott and Leonardo Bonucci all have ranges that point to massive hype potential if they can pick up an inform. 
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take:  For the most part, volatility is higher amongst the Winter items, but that is due to their prices correcting after being artificially high during the hype. Some high figures to consider can be found in Ederson, Kylian Mbappe and Virgil Van Dijk, but if you prefer a lower volatility here turn your attention to Alvaro Morata and Gerard Deulofeu.
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Again, winter OTW items’ betas are a little wonky this week, so we’re going to focus on summer items for the time being. Beta is a great way to see who has serious hype potential, and this week it seems Keita Balde and Serge Aurier have really solid risk to reward ratio.
TOTW Shout
Doubling the potential TOTW shouts is a major plus of the winter OTW items, and this week they delivered. Gylfi Sigurdsson and Davinson Sanchez had chances to be included after solid weekend performances, but it was [Nicolas Tagliafico and Federico Bernardeschi that made the cut! 
Tagliafico looks like a quality LB option and has solid nation links, while Bernardeschi is arguably the best right sided winger shout in the Calcio A. Looking forward we expect these items’ prices to drop during Lunar New Year, so keep that in mind.

In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner - Federico Bernardeschi (Juventus) 
What a week for Federico Bernardeschi! Scoring a beautiful freekick against his former club (keeper maybe could’ve done better) secured him an upgrade, but with it came an incredible price jump of 87.8% making him our big winner.   

With such a significant price increase his volatility was expected to be high (~14,500), but an interesting figure was his mediocre, negative beta (-0.52). The negative aspect doesn’t hold too much credence, yet the small beta figure suggests his price is a little risky. It won’t increase any higher than where it is at the moment, so make sure to sell into the hype. 
Paying above 75k for an 84 overall inform is something that is not recommended, especially with Lunar New Year driving the market down. Keep that in mind as selling now and buying back later could be a safe decision.

Big Loser - Alexandre Lacazette (Arsenal) 
A rough week for Alexandre Lacazette sees him as our biggest loser. A significant injury puts him out of action for more than a month, but on top of that the arrival of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang seemed to have relegated him to the bench. 
We’re going to keep this brief since his injury explains his price drop; however, we wanted to add a couple points about his outlook. When the Frenchman does return there will only be a couple months left in the season. Around that time OTW items really start to drop (as they did last year), so it might be beneficial to stay away from this card. 
Now, to leave it on an optimistic note, if Lacazette’s price drops drastically he could be  a sneaky shout in case he has himself a hell of a World Cup.
Recap & outlook
The OTW market is still settling after the promotions from a couple weeks past. Players’ prices should settle after this week, so we can get better insight into OTW items long term outlooks then. The increased player pool delivered in terms of TOTW shouts, and we hope this trend continues. Lunar New Year should jolt the overall FUT market, but we don’t expect it to crash the OTW market too hard. Lastly, a couple final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Lots of volatility amongst the OTW items as they settle from the promo, so stick to the Summer items for the moment. Winter items could be very profitable in the coming weeks.    

-- OTW investors: Prices are still correcting for a lot of items, but as they settle looking at some cheaper players in big leagues is the way to go.

Let us know how you feel about the new Winter OTW items?  Share your thoughts below, and if you can’t get enough market analysis check out our Path to Glory update!

Now live in EA SPORTS’S FIFA Mobile, a new leveling program celebrating the biggest and most exciting moves of the Summer Transfer Window. “Top Transfers” are back and in a big way.
Now and for the foreseeable future, you can grind daily Live Events that will help you add a couple of the biggest offseason movers to your squad as well.
The plans, which center around Juventus’ Federico Bernardeschi, AC Milan’s Leonardo Bonucci, Manchester United’s Nemanja Matic, Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva, Chelsea’s Alvaro Morata, and of course the big one, PSG’s Neymar Jr, require Transfer Value Tokens.
You’ll also need Gold Contracts to obtain the base items and begin to level your desired transfers up towards their maximum versions. Gold Contracts are obtainable through Live Events and Daily Activities alike, while you can get the previously mentioned Transfer Value Tokens by winning VS Attack matches. You can trade those to obtain Elite Contracts for the specific clubs, which as recent trends have dictated will be tradeable on the Transfer Market:

A trade-in plan (with a 24 hour cool down) will let you obtain a Random Elite Contract, which if its not for your desired player you can sell and start saving towards the one you did want. You'll need the specifc Elite Contract (e.g. PSG) to complete the corresponding player (Neymar).
Each player has a “base” item (all tradeable) and then three additional upgradeable options. Neymar, the program’s de facto master, has five on top of the base item. The base players require other Top Transfer items to obtain and a source tells Futhead News there will be additional Top Transfer player items added in the weeks ahead. The maximum level items are predictably tasty with Bonucci a 96 CB, Bernardeschi a 96 RW, Matic peaking as a 97-overall CDM, Silva a 97 RM, Morata a 98 ST, and Neymar at a daunting 100-overall (with wild +1 overall and +3 BAC boosts):

As always, there are pack options to help complete the program faster if you so desire, but if you put the time and grind in, you should be able to complete a pretty solid player.
This program shows a lot of promise on paper. We’ll have to see how the mechanisms work in practice."

The first day of the Manchester FUT Champions Cup brought surprises and upsets, but FIFA esports fans have come to expect that at this point. Some big names bowed out of the competition, while some old names came back to the forefront. And of course, the stalwarts that remained only solidified their standing.
After five rounds of group stages, four players, coincidentally two from each console, remained undefeated. On the Playstation side, Manchester City's Kai ""deto"" Wollin, last year's FIFA Interactive World Cup runner-up, put in an impressive shift, as did Barcelona runner-up Nicolás “Nicolas99fc” Villalba. Among Xbox One players, Javier ""Janoz""   Munoz Cordoba and 2017 Rest of World Regional Champion Mosaad ""Falcon Msdossary""    Aldossary, both familiar names in the circuit, showed up in full force.
Barcelona winner Donovan ""F2TeKkz"" Hunt finished with a 4-1 record, qualifying for the knockout stages and showing fans that he wasn't just a one-hit wonder. His only loss came in the third round against Kurt ""Kurt0411"" Fenech, an outspoken challenger who has impressed recently. 2017 FIWC Champion Spencer ""Unilad Gorilla"" Ealing followed suit with the same record, as did Fenech.
Hashtag United's Harry Hesketh came out swinging, and after a tense two-leg affair against his teammate ""Hashtag Ryan"" Pessoa, qualified for the knockouts with a 4-1 record. The ""derby"" of sorts ended 4-3 to Harry, but Pessoa remains very much in the hunt for a qualifying spot, with a 3-2 record after the first day. Adam ""Hashtag dreamR"" Barton remains in the competition too, with a 2-3 record. On the Xbox side, eight players were eliminated from the competition after securing only one win from five games.
Among PS4 candidates, the standouts from the 4-1 finishers included Hashtag's Agge Rosenmeier, whose lone loss was to Wollin. The incredibly offensive match had the makings of a grand final, finishing 6-5 in favor of Wollin, and viewers will hope to see a rematch in the latter stages of the knockout rounds.
FC Basel's Tim ""FCB TheStrxngeR"" Katnawatos, not so much a dark horse anymore, finished 4-1 as well, as did Timo ""TimoX""    Siep and Mohammed ""MoAubameyang"" Harkous. One surprising early exit on the PS4 side was Unilad's Shaun ""Shellz"" Springette, who bowed out with a disappointing 1-4 record.
The broadcast crew will be back Saturday morning at 7 a.m. ET for the last two rounds of the group stages. The knockout rounds will follow. For a more fleshed-out look at the entire weekend's schedule, you can go here. Extended coverage and behind-the-scenes action can be found on EA's Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat channels."

Another week, another FIFA 18 Ultimate Team Team of the Week.
The 22nd release of FUT 18 goes hard in the paint with big names: Cristiano Ronaldo gets, strangely enough, his first in-form of this year's game life-cycle, and at striker no less. It's not a massive bump from his TOTT item, so don't necessarily feel obliged to upgrade just because if you have the former. 
Joining him is Manchester City's four-goal hero Sergio Aguero, who on the heels of an anticipated untradeable Premier League Player of the Month SBC player item this coming Friday, gets a tradeable 93-overall item. Will the POTM be a 94 or 95 or merely an untradeable version similar to this latest? Stay tuned.
In terms of dynamic player items, Federico Bernardeschi and Nicolas Tagliafico get upgrades to their Ones to Watch while William Carvalho's Path to Glory goes up in rating. Whether you own or speculated with any of those, expect to see the bump when TOTW is in packs at 6 p.m. UK time Wednesday evening.

We've reached the last weekend of FIFA Mobile's Easter program.
While on one hand, it's kind of a disappointing that outside of the Chain Packs, there isn't a path to a guaranteed Master that isn't contingent on luck. On the other, it makes it that much more special for those that are able to get one through fate smiling on them.
Whether you pull him from the 82+ Red player, a pack, or sheer chance worked out in your favor, 92 Anthony Martial is exactly as advertised.
Manchester United homers will likely pine for the item, which seems straight out of the FIFA console of yesteryear playbook. Francophiles will dig it too, for obvious reasons. As for the rest of us? If we come across it, we should equal parts respect it and fear it.
It'll be interesting to see how these untradeable Easter items will mature, as in a rare circumstance in the game, it won't merely be the biggest spenders that have them. Whether you're in FIFA Champion or World Class III alike, you could find yourself on the receiving end of a goal barrage from the dangerous Frenchman.
In-Game Stats

We've had a lot of big-time strikers/attackers in FIFA Mobile lately. There's no denying that. Martial is still an intriguing player item, to say the least, though: from a max training (aka 100 overall) vantage, Martial compares nicely with the likes of the OP Matchups Vincent Aboubakar many of us regret having passed on and even the likes of Prime Marco Van Basten. If you can't afford POTM ST Cristiano Ronaldo but luck your way into Martial, you'll likely be more than satisfied with the trade. 
Probably the most repeated criticism we hear about Martial is relatively pedastrian 85 long shot rating. He didn't have any particularly difficulty making those from my experience at around 107 OVR training plus skill boosts. And while his low base aggression number of 71 might be a concern on paper, it didn't seem to manifest itself in-game in a meaningful sense.
Squad
My team might be a little higher end than some, but the squad I primarily used Easter Master Martial in is the one I use for most of my matches (Weekend Tournament aside). I'm still a 3-4-3D devotee, and until proven otherwise, will probably to continue to move forward in the formation.

Unlike some of our previous reviews of defenders/goalkeepers in the like, because Martial is an attacker primarily (and that won't really factor in for your opponent outside of counter attacks), the opinions below are strictly my own.
Player Review
With so many elite attacking options out there, it's hard to differentiate the competitive landscape from a squad building vantage.
Some of it will surely ultimately come down to personal preference, but if you're able to get Easter Master Anthony Martial, I can't imagine you'll be quick to burn him as XP or use in a Rank Up anytime soon.
Martial's initial quickness was especially noticeable when playing on a new sixth generation iPad. After using a trained up +13-boosted POTM Sergio Aguero for much of the past month, I thought we'd be looking at the two being roughly equal at best. Martial felt even quicker and faster.
His shooting at angles in particular turned my head, as he seemed to have a knack (particularly against high-overall possessing opponents' defenders) of carefully dancing and navigating his way to just seeing enough of an opening to take and put a shot into the net.
His long stride and gallop may also contribute to his feel. While he never quite felt as dynamic to me playing on a Google Pixel as he did on tablet, his added height gives him almost a gazelle type effect as he hits full stride, something the shorter POTM Aguero lacked. I'd compare his giddyup almost to that of POTM Cristiano Ronaldo, except Martial is even faster.
Longshots were readily pointed out as something Martial could struggle with, but I never noticed any advantage or disadvantage relative to other strikers I'd used before. If there was one of his lower ratings that felt palpable in-game, it was probably Free Kicks (just 78), and that's assuming those impact a player's performance from penalties as well. I think I took two-penalties with Martial and missed both, a strange occurrence given my usual make rate is in the high 90% and my technique hadn't changed. With such a small sample size, though, it's difficult to put a ton of weight in that concern.
A final attribute we've talked about but not discussed in this context is again his height. 80 base Heading could have and maybe should have led to a mediocre experience, but I found him extremely effective banging the ball into the back of the net on corners. I can't remember a single instance in any of the dozens of games he was used where he failed to convert a perfectly placed corner kick for a goal. That wasn't always the case with the shorter POTM Aguero with the same rating.
Summary
As arguably the premier attacker of his promo, it probably shouldn't go down as surprising that Martial is as advertised. He's not the best attacker I've used in this season of FIFA Mobile, but he's definitely up there. The lingering issue is how hard he is to get your hands on, with maybe the only silver lining being is the slight off chance we see him in a future Squad Building Challenge, Tournament SBC, or the like (wishful thinking, perhaps).
If you see a Red 82+ pop up anytime this Easter weekend and you've got the eggs to gamble, my advice would be to go for it. If you get the 92 Martial, the grind will 1000x have been worth it. And even if you strike out, you'll have something you can sell or burn for your troubles.
Rating:  9.5/10

We've officially reached the point of the FIFA 18 Ultimate Team Team of the Week release cycle when the Team of the Season hype is making it less and less desirable.
That said, if you're a fan of a few specific clubs (or players), there might just be a gem or two you'll want to capitalize on in the coming week.
Ones to Watch Philippe Coutinho, he of a brilliant through ball and corner assist, and Juventus' Douglas Costa, get their first black-dynamic-player-item boosts of FUT 18. Better late than never? With OTWs set to call it a season in less than a month, it might just be better to invest in the in-forms, if you aren't super confident these guys will get another in-form, Man of the Match, or perhaps even Team of the Knockout Stage between now and then.
Francsico Roman Alarcon Suarez, better known as Isco, is joined by Chelsea's Olivier Giroud and Bayern's Sandro Wagner in the Path to Glory boost department. Isco and Giroud seem like near locks for their national teams too, so it wouldn't be at all surprising to see them automatically turn into PTG Selected items in early June.
Finally, if you're looking for your weekly sleeper, this TOTW side's backup keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma looks a bit tasty. He'll have a perfect link to TOTY Bonucci, an underrated overpowered beast in this year's release. If he meets our own FUT Economist's ""Lozano Rule"", e.g. costs less than SIF Hirving Lozano, with TOTS a stretch, he might well be worth the coins to become your new keeper.

Dortmund v Schalke
The Revierderby comes at the perfect time for one side, and the worst possible time. Both sides are missing key players, with Dortmund having both Reus and Piszczek out with long term injuries, while Schalke may be without their key midfield playmaker Goretzka. With Schalke 3 points ahead of their neighbours, both sides will be looking to take home a win to get bragging rights but also 3 very valuable points in the close group of clubs fighting 2nd to 14th separated by just 9 points. 
Dortmund’s first 9 games saw them boast a record of 7-1-1 in all competitions. However, that has turned round to 1-3-5 in their most recent 9, with that win being in that DFB Pokal against 3rd tier Madgeburg. With losses against Spurs, Bayern and Leipzig and two draws against APOEL, Dortmund are in dire form and in desperate need of some positive results if they want to even keep their hopes of qualifying for next years Champions League alive, never mind the title challenge they were making just a month or so ago.
On the other side, Schalke are in great form, and occupy Dortmund's normal 2nd place spot in the league table. After tough losses in against Bayern and Hoffenheim, they are unbeaten in their last 7 games. With 5 clean sheets and only 10 conceded, they have their second best defensive record this season behind Bayern. 
The past 3 encounters have all ended in a stalemate, with this weeks hosts winning the 2 previous games. As a Dortmund fan, I obviously want a home win, but I have big doubts about whether that will happen or not.
My prediction: Draw

Racing Club v Independiente
After a Mexican game last week, we have one from Argentina this time round as Racing Club host Independiente. It is still early on in the season, but the table is still very close with just 3 points separating 6th and 21st. Both of our teams are in the middle of that group, with 15th hosting 8th.
Racing Club have only won 2 of their last 10 games, but one of them was last weekend against league leaders Boca Juniors. Having been knocked out of the Copa Libertadores, the league is now their main focus, so they will be hoping to get another win under their belts and start moving up the table again.
Opponents Independiente are in much better form, with just 1 loss in their last 8 games - a 1-0 loss in the first leg of their Copa Libertadores semi-final earlier this week. However, with just 9 goals scored and 9 conceded in their 10 league games this season, they aren’t known for their high scoring matches, with 4 games ending at 1-0.
With both teams not really having many high scoring encounters this season, I believe that will keep happening, with the hosts winning by a small margin.
My prediction: Racing Club win

Liverpool v Chelsea
This will be a very interesting game, with both teams in very high scoring form and both wanting a win to keep their slight title chances alive.
Liverpool have scored 3 or more in 6 of their previous 7 games, keeping 4 clean sheets in that time as well. However, they suffered a surprise 3-3 draw on Tuesday after were leading 3-0 at half time. With Coutinho possibly nursing a slight injury, his fitness alone as the potential to determine this game. 
Chelsea come into the game on the back of back-to-back 4-0 wins against West Brom and Qarabag. Hazard and Morata are forming a fine partnership up front, which is leading to a very dangerous striker pairing. Both should be well rested as well, and with 6 goals and 3 assists between them in the last 5 games, they are a threat to any team, never mind one as defensively fragile as Liverpool.
I can see both teams scoring, which makes this game very difficult to call, but I sense a 3-2 win may happen to either side, but I’m going with a draw as that seems to be the most likely result - 5 of the previous 7 games have ended in a draw running back to 2015.
My prediction:  Draw

Monaco v PSG
The big game in Ligue 1 is the battle at the top of the table, with second placed Monaco hosting leaders PSG. 
Hosts Monaco have lost twice in Ligue 1, which has made them play catch-up on this weeks opponents PSG from the very start, and what better time to close the gap than this week. After a disappointing 1-1 draw last week against Amiens last week, they are in desperate need of a big win to restart the title race. 
The visitors sit 6 points clear at the top of the table and are scoring for fun, with 43 goals in 13 games so far. With Cavani, Neymar and Mbappe all more than comfortable in front of goal, it looks set to be a high scoring encounter for sure.
With Monaco suffering a big defeat against Leipzig midweek, I can only see this going one way, and that’s with an away win.
My prediction: PSG win

That concludes this weeks game and my predictions. Let me know on twitter, @Darren_8196. Happy predicting!"

We're just over three months to FIFA 18 (and a brand new season of Ultimate Team)'s launch and with it, new player stats and ratings to debate and argue over.
If you haven't already seen them, be sure to check out Futhead's FIFA 18 player ratings prediction pages, including the new Icons (formerly known as Legends). You can make your voice heard by voting, plus take your thoughts to the comments  and fight tooth and nail in an effort to make sure your favorite players get theirs.
Before you do, you'd be well served to check out the latest from friend of FH, former FIFA community manager, and YouTuber standout Chu ""Chu Boi"" Morah. A self-professed Ronaldo Stan, Chu takes a look at all the top players from the defending back-to-back champions of Europe and forecasts where all the Galacticos will be rated next FUT.
As a bit of a Gareth Bale homer in my own right, not too sure I agree with where he sees the Welshman's rating going. 
Be sure to check out Chu's latest and let us know which Madrid players he nailed and which he should go back to the drawing board on:

Market Overview
As the FUT market moves into the New Year, there has been plenty to talk about. Yet, as a summary we’ll keep it as concise as we can. Generally, the price of elite players have seen a continued decline, while the end of the guaranteed inform SBCs has dropped the prices of the 83/84 golds as well. 
Overall it seems the market is at a point were players are relatively cheap; however, before buying, definitely consider the uncertainty of Team of the Year, and the pack promos that will bring. 
Now for the market you’re all here for, Ones to Watch. This week the OTW market has seen its fair share of ups and downs. Towards the end of the week player prices seem to lean more towards down, but with an upgraded item and potential SBC on the horizon there is still a ton to talk about! 
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  Interestingly, there were too polar ranges between players this week. It s was either large differences or narrow gaps and the likes in Romelu Lukaku, Kyle Walker and Bruma represented the former, while Franck Kessie, Douglas Costa and Alvaro Morata embodied the latter.

Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take: Looking at the figure above, the most noticeable aspect of volatility came towards the bottom of the list. Federico Bernardeschi, Davinson Sanchez and Bertrand Traore all sported large figures compared to their price, so it might be time to consider them for their investment potential. 
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Players like Alexandre Lacazette, Leonardo Bonucci and Nelson Semedo really stand out due to their high numbers, but what it’s telling you is that these cards could be poised for large price changes if the market rebounds or busts.
TOTW Shout
With some many leagues on break it was up the Premier League to lead the charge for informs, and it did not disappoint! Ederson and Mohamed Salah both put in compelling performances; however the Brazilian keeper featured while the Egyptian just missed out. 
In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner --  Ederson (Manchester City)  
Winner winner, chicken dinner! The Man City shot stopper finally picked up and inform and a 89.3% return cannot be ignored, so this weeks biggest winner (by far) is Ederson. After a disappointing snub from the Team of the Group Stage we are glad to see him get some recognition.
Talking numbers, a huge volatility (~37,000) and beta (3.72) show just how much hype this Brazilian generated. For an 85-rated card that is kinda wild, and his price should settle down from where it currently is just like many other OTW who’ve received upgrade. That being said, those numbers bode extremely well if the ex-Benfica man puts in another quality performance.
His price is inflated now, but when he settles Ederson is one to monitor as another upgrade could yield huge returns! 
Big Loser -- James Rodriguez (Bayern)
A OTW weekly analysis first, but hey why not in 2018! James Rodriguez finds himself as the biggest loser for the second week in a row. There were a lot negative numbers this week, but after receive quite a few questions about him we had to highlight the Colombian. 
Looking at his weekly stats, the midfield man really had tame volatility (~3000) and beta (0.25) figures. This shows that he followed the market and is evident by his price decline, but there's something deeper in those numbers. Delving deeper, those statistics might shed a hopeful light on the ex-Madridista. Both of the preceding figures are risk measures, so with lower values it could spell the end of our mans price drop meaning its a compelling time to invest if you can get in low.

Also, a positive for James is the return of Bundesliga football so don’t sleep on him. 
Recap & outlook
To wrap it up, arguably the biggest event looms in the Team of the Year which has scared players. Since they’re not buying prices have fallen. Yet, looking just beyond that to February we could see a OTW SBC for the new batch after January transfers. This could completely shock the exiting OTW items so watch this space! Some interesting final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Lots of volatility this week and uncertainty can always lead to quick flips. Be weary of the low buyer pool though.   

-- OTW investors: Now could be the ideal time to start picking up some piece before the February SBC hype really picks up.
If you're like us and can’t get enough of the market check out the Path to Glory update from earlier in the week for another look at dynamic players!

After going perfect the week before last, anything short of repeating that would be a disappointment. So, after the SBC release this week, fifty percent was a bummer. This week has a ton of rivalries to choose from, but that always makes it fun for investors who feel comfortable diversifying their selections. As always, expect a curveball or two from EA, but we'll be swinging for the fences again in our predictions below anyways. 
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Manchester United vs Chelsea
Match Info:  Truly a marquee match to start the predictions this week. Two powerhouses from the PL square off this weekend, and both teams have a lot riding on this game. This tie will receive a ton of hype, but the only thing investors should be wary of is what happened with the Manchester derby.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 79 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Besiktas vs Fenerbahce 
Match Info:  Shifting across the continent, another big rivalry headlines a match week, as these two Turkish giants square off. Lots of bragging rights to play for, as well as European spots to solidify. Definitely look to the non-rares here, and regardless of what happens flipping them overnight should yield profit. 

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 rated


Player Requirement: 2 to 3 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


PSG vs Marseille
Match Info:  Yep, you guessed it! Another big rivalry, and it deserves our consideration. One major thing to downside is that fact that Marseille featured just two weeks ago, is that enough time for EA? If it is, expect these players' prices to jump. 

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Colon vs Union
Match Info: We’re taking a little bit of liberty here, but we believe it's about time for Argentina to see some more love from EA. The Sante Fe derby makes it four for four on rivalries in our main predictions, and hopefully it will pay off. Look to the non-rares here and maybe some higher rated golds around the league.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 70 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there tends to be some variance each week, let's take a look at some more outside the box picks that could make their way in:
AC Milan vs Roma
Match Info:  EA seem to be on a big Serie A kick lately, so we looked at the most compelling fixture from their match week. Milan is in solid form, while Roma has just been solid all season. Some Europe spots on the line here, so points will be important to both sides. Non-rares of course. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Bremen vs Hamburg
Match Info: The only reason this rivalry gets pushed down is because EA chose to feature a Bundesliga matchup in the current SBC. As a big Bremen fan it’ll always be nice to see them feature, but this rivalry already got over looked once. Nonetheless, non-rares in Germany’s top flight have been holding value really well lately, so this is a lower risk option.   

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


FC Tokyo vs Urawa Red Diamonds
Match Info: Japan’s domestic season is about to begin, so to pay our respects we decided to select the highest profile matchup. Not a conventional rivals, but this shout should be really low hype meaning you can pick up quite a few deals.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 70 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sydney vs West Sydney Wanderers
Match Info: Is it us or does it seem the A-League has been spitting out Marquee Matchups this year? Well, another solid shout comes in the form of this Sydney derby. It's always best to be prepared, and no league gets hyped like the A-League.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 68 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
The Swiss League narrowly missed out last week so we’re taking another stab. We also wanted to include a newer rivalry to the list too. Can we do two deep sleepers? Why not, we make the rules.
Grasshopper vs FC Zurich & Doncaster vs Rotherham

It's been a while, Futheaders! I hope you had a wonderful holiday season with your family, and a great New Years. I wish you all the best for the year to come.
We're kicking off the year with a whole bunch of reviews. I'll be doing player reviews, player comparisons, and other new types of articles.
Today, we start off with the best player in FUT -- the 90-rated Ruud Gullit.
I know that ninety-something percent of you will never use this item, and to you, this review may be useless. But bear with me, and you'll see why I'm doing this.
In-Game Stats
Potentially the best in-game stats in the game.

87+ acceleration, sprint speed, shot power, positioning, finishing, long shots, vision, free kicks, long and short passing, reactions, ball control, composure, heading and stamina - he's the best around. He's only got three stats below 80, and they are all defensive stats (and still 75+).
I use him with the Hawk chemistry style, which gives him the following boosts:

Fun fact -- he's a 93-rated striker with this boost.
Stats
Price: 3,333,000
Games: 163
Goals: 433
Assists: 114
All stats are from Legendary/Ultimate Squad Battles, Online Divisions and Online Singles Matches.
Squad
Here is the squad I currently use him in (I switch to 4-3-1-2 in game). I've used him predominantly at ST, but he's currently playing at CAM.

Let's get into the review.
Review
Pace: 10/10
Once he gets going, he's unstoppable. I was very pleasantly surprised at how fast he feels in game. With the Hawk chemistry style, he outpaces any defenders or midfielders, and once he gets away, there is no catching up. I frequently just sprint past the opponents, relying on nothing but his pace to get through to goal.
Shooting: 10/10
The best shot I've used this year. Perfect positioning, perfect finishing, and the best long shots and shot power I have used (on both feet). Inside the box, any type of shot is going in. Outside the box, any shot can go in if you hit it right. My favorite shot to score with him is near post screamers (from anywhere between 5 and 35 yards), and his finesse shots are delightfully good.
Passing: 10/10
He pulls off every pass with ease. The long passing is the best I've used this year by a long ways, and the short passing is as good as it gets. I am always blown away by his vision -- he can see and pull off passes that no other player can. His free kicks are incredible (he is the only player I can consistently score them with), and his curve is unreal.
Dribbling: 10/10
One of my favorite parts of the item. Perfect ball control, seamless dribbling, incredible agility and balance. He doesn't feel clunky at all, he never makes a mistake on the ball, and he can dribble through entire teams with ease. For a player as big and strong as he is, he's incredible. The best dribbler I have used this year.
Defending: 10/10
Perfection. Feels so much higher than 80 in-game, even without the boosts. He intercepts everything, and his long reach and incredible strength plus acceleration means he wins every tackle. He can break up the play like the best of them.
Physical: 10/10
Utterly dominant. His braids, his height, and his unbelievable power makes him unstoppable. He's never bullied on the ball, never contained, never beaten in the air, and never bested in a challenge. He is the definition of a tank. The only player who can even come close is Prime Patrick Vieira, and even then, Gullit is usually the winner.
Weak-foot: 10/10
Makes the item truly god-tier. He can do everything, and he can do it with either foot. The five-star weak foot means you don't have to think when using this -- you just do, and he does it perfectly. It makes him completely unpredictable, and totally unstoppable.
Skills: 9/10
Every skill is perfectly executed. The combination of pace, strength and unreal dribbling makes him a skiller's wet dream.
The only downside is that he doesn't have five-star skills. But that is literally the only flaw.
Summary
This is the best item in the game so far. He's the most dominant, complete, utterly incredible player I've ever used. If you ever have the opportunity, get it.
The main point of this review is to show you that the perfect player exists. He is the ultimate man for your Ultimate Team. As I review players this year, this man will be the scale on which they are measured -- his perfection makes him the perfect yard stick.
But here's the question -- is he worth it? Is any player worth it at almost four million?
In one word -- yes. I was of the strong opinion that no player is worth that much, but Gullit single handedly wins me games and divisions. He has singlehandedly won he hundreds of thousands in rewards, and by the end of the year, he'll pay that four million back.
Also, he's a joy to play with, and at the end of the day, it's a game.
Rating: 10/10
Value for Coins: 10/10"

Xbox One champion Aldossary 'Falcon Msdossary' Mosaad topped PlayStation champion Philipp 'Eisvogel' Schermer, 6-4, in the Manchester FUT Champions Cup Grand Final to earn the claim of being the reignin ""best FIFA player in the world"" Sunday. The Saudi Arabian had already established himself as a favorite after the group stages, while Eisvogel flew mostly under the radar before emerging as the PS4 champ.
HE'S DONE IT! @Msdossary7 is the champion in Manchester!   #FIFAeWorldCup https://t.co/6KSBqgKLvO pic.twitter.com/B5RLge5cbD— EA SPORTS FIFA (@EASPORTSFIFA) April 15, 2018

Msdossary came out flying in the first leg of the Grand Final, scoring two quick goals in the first half, but Eisvogel pinned him back just as quickly in the second. The tie ended 2-2, and the two goals in the second half were crucial for the latter as they got the German back in position to potentially win the tie.
The Xbox champion retaliated in the 14th minute of the second leg, however, picking up a rebound goal through his Lionel Messi, to earn his own away goal and take the 3-2 aggregate lead early. He doubled his advantage with his Icon Ronaldo another 15 minutes later, and the tie looked like it had been put to bed. Even with the two-goal cushion, however, Aldossary could not rest for the game was truly end-to-end entertainment, and Eisvogel had shown in the first leg that he could mount a comeback quickly.
And that was exactly how the second half of the second leg started, Eisvogel, using his standard 4-2-2-2 formation, wove through Aldossary's defense and finished with a Cristiano Ronaldo finesse to make it 4-3 in the 59th minute. But, what felt like seconds later, Msdossary scored again to make it 3-1, and 5-3 on aggregate. But, with 10 minutes left, the Saudi Arabian showed audiences why he deserved the title with a Ronaldo finesse from outside the box. Eisvogel replied quickly yet again to make it 6-4 on aggregate, but that was all she wrote.
In order to fill the remaining playoff spots that were left unoccupied due to prior qualifiers, EA staged an ancillary playoff of the quarterfinalists who failed to advance. Schalke's Tim 'S04 Tim Latka' Schwartmann and Kurt 'Kurt0411' Fenech were two of the notables amongst the five.
Aldossary's road to the Grand Final did not look easy on paper, but the champion sure made it look easy. The Saudi Arabian blew out his opponents until the Xbox console grand final. He scored 26 goals and only conceded five goals, beating Melbourne City's Marcus Gomez, 6-1, then taking care of business against Marcio 'FELIPE ABD' Marinho Abade by a scoreline of 7-1. In the quarterfinals today, he rolled past Martin 'RemiMartinn' Oregel, 5-1; Oregel had been fresh off a win against reigning Barcelona champion Donovan 'F2TeKkz' Hunt. He faced another North American opponent, the Canadian Nawid 'GoalMachine' Noorzai, 8-2, in the semifinals.
""In past tournaments, I would get nervous. I think in FIFA, the most important thing is the mentality. I trust myself [now]. I know that I will score goals,"" Aldossary said after his win over Grand Final win over Eisvogel. ""I have no problem with it. I just have problems with my defense.""
I AM THE CAPTAIN NOW. @Msdossary7 defeats @NRaseck7 in a thrilling @Xbox Final to advance to the Grand Final. WOW #FIFAeWorldCuphttps://t.co/6KSBqgKLvO pic.twitter.com/hLS0pewYFS— EA SPORTS FIFA (@EASPORTSFIFA) April 15, 2018

The competition only truly ramped up for Msdossary in the console finals, in his matchup against Niklas 'Nraseck 7' Raseck. The German gave his opponent the fight of his life, as the two-leg affair ended 7-6 in favor of the eventual winner of the entire competition.
""I think that was the best game that I played, it put me in the right mentality to be prepared for the final,"" Aldossary said. ""Raseck was the best opponent I played [all tournament].""
The story on the PlayStation side was relatively different, with Eisvogel almost being knocked out on multiple occasions. The German played and won a tough Round of 64 matchup against Stefano Pinna, beating him 8-7 on aggregate. Schermer finished off Ettore   Abrucio, 5-2, in the Round of 32 before coming up against Corentin 'LOSC Maestro' Thuillier in the quarterfinals today. That matchup ended 4-3 to Eisvogel, but his marquee matchup was waiting for him in the PS4 console semifinals. There, he'd play Barcelona runner-up Nicolás “Nicolas99fc” Villalba, who had yet to lose a matchup in the entire tournament. The game proved to live up to hype, the tight affair finishing 4-3 to Eisvogel again. He went on to play Henrique 'Zezinho23'   Silva in the console finals, a surprise candidate.
Zezinho had just beat Manchester City's Kai 'deto' Wollin, the 2017 FIFA Interactive World Cup runner-up, and a player who had shown up strong all tournament. The Playstation console final ended up finishing 5-3 to Schermer, and thus, the Grand Final was set.
The FIFA eWorld Cup will return will the playoff legs in June, the top eight players from January's competition in Barcelona and the top eight from this weekend (including the second-chance playoff) have already qualified, so we'll see some familiar names in the mix come this Summer."

FIFA Mobile's biggest event of the year comes to its epic conclusion with Ultimate Team of the Season. While the name's been coopted by console this FIFA as well, rest assured, Mobile's Ultimate TOTS players more than lives up to the billing. 
The third ""tier"" of the Team of the Season ""pyramid"", these untradeable 97-to-99 overall rated mega-player items require you to have done a Starter plan, a subsequent ""FIFA Mobile TOTS"" upgrade plan, and now a third and final Ultimate TOTS plan using a set number of Ultimate Upgrade tokens, elite TOTS tokens, league specific TOTS tokens, and general TOTS tokens . After doing so, you're bestowed an item which should make waves for you in VS Attack Mode for the rest of the first season of FM.
Forewarning: the costs are mighty steep. It remains to be seen whether or not Elite TOTS token drop rates will be increased as even with an also expensive TOTS token trade-in plan, most cards are out of reach at the moment, even for pay-to-play players.
Influenced by the most popular plans completed in the second-round of the program, the so-called FIFA Mobile TOTS, many of the names from this morning's console Ultimate TOTS feature in the best XI FM's seen to date.
Here's the complete FIFA Mobile Ultimate TOTS and how many Ultimate Upgrade tokens they need:

GK: 98 OVR - Gianluigi Buffon - Juventus (Italy) - Italy (3)
CB: 97 OVR - Kalidou Koulibaly - Napoli (Italy) - Senegal (1)
LB: 98 OVR - Filipe Luís - Atletico Madrid (Spain) - Brazil (2)
LWB: 97 OVR - Marcos Alonso - Chelsea (England) - Spain (1)
LM: 97 OVR - Emil Forsberg - RB Leipzig (Germany) - Sweden (1)
CM: 98 OVR - Toni Kroos - Real Madrid CF (Spain) - Germany (2)
CM: 99 OVR - N'Golo Kanté - Chelsea (England) - France (4)
CAM: 97 OVR - Dele Alli - Tottenham Hotspur (England) - England (1)
LW: 99 OVR - Cristiano Ronaldo - Real Madrid CF (Spain) - Portugal (3)
ST: 98 OVR - Robert Lewandowski - FC Bayern Munchen (Germany) - Poland (2)
RW: 99 OVR - Lionel Messi - FC Barcelona (Spain) - Argentina (3)"

Team of the Week on FIFA console gets so bleak during the offseason for the big five domestic leagues that some FIFA community (and Futhead commentariat) members have taken to pejoratively calling it ""Team of the Weak"".
In an effort to avoid the same fate, FIFA Mobile's scrapped TOTW altogether for their summer.
Enter Community Team of the Week.
Honoring top players from the new-ish Versus Attack Mode, FIFA Mobile aims to instead create a TOTW plan (and Master player) each week based on the players in the lineup of a top player. The first is FM's first VsA Champion, SirLe. Ostensibly MooPiCait, the number two ranked player and second to make it to Champion, can't be far behind.
Of course a few key questions remain: what will they do when they run out of players given how similar so many of the highest ranked players' squad are, and how will they manage to keep this affordable? This first cTOTW features a 91-overall Manuel Neuer which will surely go for around a million coins or more. 
Perhaps most excitingly, there's finally incentive to consider keeping the master player as they now offer a pair of +All boosts to your squad. There's also a new Martial Plan token to be had.
You can check out the new cTOTW plan here as well as in-game in FM:


Master player: CM - Luka Modrić - Real Madrid


GK - Manuel Neuer - FC Bayern München


LWB - Danny Rose - Tottenham Hotspur


CB - Thiago Silva - Paris Saint-Germain


RB - Darijo Srna - Shakhtar Donetsk


RWB - Daniel Alves da Silva - Juventus


LM - Heung Min Son - Tottenham Hotspur


CDM - Esteban Cambiasso - Olympiacos CFP


CDM - Arturo Vidal - FC Bayern München


RM - Gareth Bale - Real Madrid


ST - Marc Janko - FC Basel"

Pretty much everyone could see this one coming. But now it's FIFA Ultimate Team official.
After a dominant January 2018 -- and a near equally fire-emoji worthy start to February -- Manchester City's mainstay Sergio Aguero is your first Premier League Player of the Month of 2018. In FUT parlance, that means he's getting an OP (though untradeable) purple Squad Building Challenge unlockable player item, available for the next several weeks. 
Aguero edges out teammate Kevin De Bruyne, Spurs' duo of Christian Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen, Chelsea's Eden Hazard, and Bournemouth's Callum Wilson for the honor. Sergio and City won three of four in January with Kun accounting for 5 goals and an assist en route to the 12 points.
With plenty of anticipation (and likely investments to boot), the only real lingering question was what was the price to complete the SBC going to look like?
A player of Aguero's ilk with these kind of ratings was never going to be cheap, but this one is particularly expensive (you'll need an IF Aguero to get it done). And with a lower rated but tradeable in-form in packs for this weekend's Lunar New Year promotion, City, Premier League, Argentina, and prodigious in-game FIFA striker lovers alike will have some tough decisions to make.
You can check out the requirements for both the permanent Aguero POTM item as well as a loan version in Futhead's SBC section."

                        Final week of the big leagues ends with a bang
                    

Last week's score:16/23
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad Link: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/6482543/

Goalkeeper
Keylor Navas - GK - 85 OVR
Navas has often been in line for TOTW's however he has yet to pick one up this year. Now could well be that time though after the Costa Rican made a total of six saves in Madrid's 2-0 win which saw him pick up MOTM with a perfect 3 rating.
Defenders
Jemerson - CB - 77 OVR
Although Monaco pretty much had the title wrapped up last week it was mathematically confirmed mid-week and then they recorded a 3-2 win over Rennes for good measure. Costil picked up MOTM with an 8 but with Jemerson making TOTW with a 7 after he scored I can see him making the cut.
Espen Ruud - RB - 72 OVR
Ruud could well miss out due to it being a Thursday match but with two goals and a clean sheet to his name from the RB position he really should be getting the nod, especially with the sheer lack of options when it comes to defenders this week. 
Ben Davies - LB - 78 OVR
This one’s a bit of a punt but with Spurs recording two huge wins this week I can see more than the obvious being selected. Davies contributed in both the wins with an assist over Leicester and a goal over Hull alongside playing well defensively in both matches, Hull especially.
Midfielders
Heung Min Son - LW - 79 OVR
Kane claimed all the headlines once again scoring four in Spur's first win before bagging another three in in their 7-1 win over Hull however with his TOTS currently in packs he is unable to pick up an IF. After 6-1 and 7-1 results, I can't see Spurs missing out though and thus Son who has 2 goals and 2 assists over the two games makes my side.
Paulo Dybala - CAM - 86 OVR
Dybala is picking up a silly amount of IF's this year but with him picking up a goal and an assist in Juventus's 3-0 home win over Crotone in a match which saw them officially claim the title (yet again) he could well be picking up a hero item.
Domenico Berardi - RW - 82 OVR
Berardi picked up the highest mark it Italy this week after he scored one of his own alongside picking up two assists in Sassuolo's 6-2 home win. Pointless match but they are often the high scoring ones.
Vitolo - LM - 83 OVR
Sevilla picked up a convincing 5-0 win over Osasuna and although several players played well as you would expect in a convincing win Vitolo was by far the best player. The Spaniard scored twice and assisted another claiming 3 from Marca in the process.
Forwards
Sergio Aguero - ST - 89 OVR
The Argentine wrongfully missed out on a TOTS spot in my eyes with him always being a threat while present in the side. Despite that he will be getting a boost this week in the way of another IF. He scored twice and assisted another as City finished their season with a 5-0 away win over Hull
Alexandre Lacazette - ST - 85 OVR
Lacazette could easily miss out if Ligue 1 is close on the agenda in terms of TOTS but with Bundesliga seemingly being next I am taking the punt on him getting a little boost. The Frenchman picked up an 8/10 from L'equipe after he scored twice in Lyon's 3-3 draw with Nice.
Marco Reus - ST - 88 OVR
I believe it will be the turn of Bundesliga in terms of TOTS order and with PEA being ruled out because of that I can see Reus easily sneaking in. The German played the role of striker and scored twice picking up a 1.5 from Kicker in the process.
Substitutes
Sergio Romero - GK - 79 OVR
United have several players which could end up making the cut this week with both Pogba and Bailly being valid shouts however it is the unusual face of Romero who I am opting for. The Argentine saved a penalty along with making several other saves in United’s mid-week 0-0 draw with Southampton
Georgino Wijnaldum - CM - 81 OVR
With both the title race and relegation battle both tied up all eyes were on who was getting top 4 in the EPL and courtesy of a 3-0 home win it was Liverpool who managed to claim in knocking Arsenal down to 5th. Wijnaldum is arguably the best option from the match after he scored one and assisted another.
Nicolas De Preville - LM - 77 OVR
Lille were dominant with their end to the season with a comfortable 3-0 win over Nancy. Preville scored all three of those goals making him player of the week in France.
Miguel Almiron - CAM - 75 OVR
The first of two MLS players to make the cut for me this week is Almiron. The Atlanta midfielder scored three of their 4 goals during a 4-1 home win over Dynamo.
Daniel Ginczek - ST - 77 OVR
Stuttgart confirmed the Bundesliga 2 title courtesy of a 4-1 win on Sunday. Ginczek was involved in all the goals with three assists before grabbing one of his own. He picked up POTW with a 1 rating and I would presume that sees him pick up a hero item.
Fedor Smolov- ST - 79 OVR
I'm not entirely sure how EA will work with Smolov in terms of rating but after the Russian scored a hat trick for Krasnodar this weekend I can't see him not being selected by them.
Shinzo Koroki - ST - 73 OVR
Koroki is pretty much the Clint Dempsey of the Japanese league in terms of FUT items once he receives his SIF. The striker scored all three of his sides goals in a 3-3 draw.
Reserves
Christian Mathenia - GK - 74 OVR
Mathenia picked up Bundesliga POTW as he made four saves in a winner takes all match with Wolfsburg of which Hamburg won 2-1. Kicker awarded his performance with the top rating possible which could easily result in him picking up a hero item.
Gerso - RW - 74 OVR
Once again, we saw a multitude of hat tricks from Bronze and silver players which makes the reserves section easy, especially in terms of midfielders, Gerso falls into that category after scoring all of KC's goals in a 3-0 win over Sounders.
Christian Jakobsen - LM - 58 OVR
A second hat trick from midfield now as Jakobsen managed to score all his sides goals in their 3-0 home win over Brondby. The bronzes are coming in full force this month.
Luca Tremolada - CAM - 64 OVR
Talking of Bronzes although this one is not a hat trick it's just as good, if not better in my eyes. Tremolada managed both two goals and two assists in his sides 4-1 home win.
Ruben Farfan - ST - 67 OVR
A Thursday game in Chile is not often what you will see featured in TOTW but after Farfan scored three in his sides 4-1 win he becomes hard to ignore. Looks like a very good item in terms of silver IF's as well."

                        With BPL TOTS likely to be around the corner a TOTW with Neymar, Coutinho, Robben and a couple of hero's is a good way to get ready.
                    

Formation: 3-4-1-2
Last week's score 17/23
Squad Link:http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/6351704/

Goalkeeper
Timo Horn- GK - 77 OVR
Horn only recently picked up his first IF but with horn being the only stand out keeper which is gold it makes him very difficult to ignore. The German stopper picked up a 1 from kicker for his seven saves in Koln's 2-2 draw with Leverkusen.
Defenders
 Gaya - LB - 80 OVR
Another week, another Valencia defender. It was Gaya who helped them to pick up three points this time around, scoring the only goal in their 1-0 win over Espanyol.
Kyle Naughton- RB - 75 OVR
Swansea picked up a vital three points away at Sunderland with a 2-0 win. Naughton scored the second of those two in a result, combined with Hull's loss, that confirmed safety for another season. Sigurdsson should receive a few thank you cards.
 Nacho Fernandez - LB - 80 OVR
Another BBVA LB now and despite doing more on paper Nacho is the weaker of the two options. The young Spaniard both scored and assist one goal as Madrid managed a 4-1 win over Sevilla. Ronaldo was the stand out player but can he really pick up anymore IF's?
Midfielders
Neymar - LW - 92 OVR
Neymar is in line for another little boost to is item just before TOTS after he was involved in all four of Barcelona's goals in a 4-1 away win over Las Palmas. The tricky winger scored three of his own alongside picking up the assist for Suarez.
 Coutinho - CM - 86 OVR
I'm not sure what to make of the Liverpool line-up but on paper it looks as though Coutinho played a CM role which I find hard to believe. Either way, regardless of where Coutinho played he will be making the cut after the Brazilian scored twice and assisted another in Liverpool's convincing 4-0 win over West Ham.
Arjen Robben - RM - 80 OVR
Robben was officially Bundesliga POTW for his goal and assist in Munich's 5-4 away win over Leipzig of which included a very late turnaround. Although this would be his fourth IF the fact that he is player of the week usually goes a long way.
 Jose Callejon - RW - 82 OVR
Callejon was right on the border of making TOTS MC and thankfully he didn’t as he is now pretty much guaranteed to make TOTW after picking up player of the week in Italy. The Spaniard scored twice and assisted another in Napoli's 5-0 demolition of Torino, claiming an 8/10 from Gazzetta in the process.
Lucas - RW - 82 OVR
Although PSG managed a convincing 5-0 away win over St Etienne it was still not enough for them. They will probably be picking up an IF though with several players picking up good L'equipe ratings. Lucas managed an 8 and thus gets my selection.
Forwards
Oliver Giroud - ST - 83 OVR
Despite it being Sanchez who picked up MOTM in Arsenal's 4-1 away win over Stoke I am going with the Frenchman to pick up the IF. Giroud scored two of the four goals and with Sanchez being next to a certainty for the next TOTS I can't see him getting the nod over Giroud.
 Jonas - ST - 84 OVR
Benfica had led the division for a very long time but with Porto on the chase it was important that they continued to win their games. They officially confirmed the title this weekend courtesy of a convincing 5-0 win and with Jonas picking up two goals and an assist in the match it makes sense for him to make the cut for so many reasons.
Substitutes
Eiji Kawashima - GK - 69 OVR
Once again, we are opting for the silver keeper option with a lack of options in the goalkeeper department. Kawashima picked up a 9/10 from L'equipe which is not something which occurs often and although Metz failed to win the match 5 saves and a penalty save in a 1-1 draw is nothing to overlook.
Manuel Fernandes - LM - 80 OVR
Annoyingly it looks as though Fernandes played out wide else he would have been an amazing central item. The Portuguese midfielder picked up Russia's POTW after he scored one and assisted another two in Lokomotiv's 4-0 home win picking up an impressive 9/10
Andrej Kramaric - LW - 77 OVR
The Bundesliga was the hardest league to select players from despite the large amount of options present. Kramaric is one which I feel will walk in though after he scored twice in Hoffenheim's 5-3 away win over Werder Bremen which saw him awarded with a 1.5 and MOTM from Kicker.
Dirk Kuyt - CM - 76 OVR
Feyenoord picked up the title this weekend, shocking both PSV and Ajax in the three-horse race. Kuyt played the pivotal role in a 3-1 win which eventually secured them the title scoring all three of the goals.
Diego Farias - RM - 74 OVR
Farias played a further back role than his usual ST position with Cagliarli opting to play him out wide. He still performed well scoring twice in their 3-2 win picking up a 7.5 from Gazzetta.
Falcao - ST - 82 OVR
PSG's streak is finally over after it was Monaco who picked up the title this weekend (all but confirmed). No Monaco player officially made TOTW but seeing as Falcao received an 8/10 for his brace he could easily make the cut as a hero item. 
Vagner Love - ST - 78 OVR
Turkey look set to pick up yet another forward option in Vagner Love after the Brazilian scored a hat trick in his sides 4-2 win. Not the player he used to be in terms of FUT but still a useable item nonetheless.
Reserves
 Jamie McGrath - CM - 57 OVR
I'm usually quite blunt when it comes to the Irish IF's with them being completely unusable a good 90% of the time and although McGrath will pretty much only be pace at least he has something going for him. The Dundalk midfielder scored three of their four goals to secure his spot in this side.
 Gilbert Koomson - RW - 64 OVR
No need for EA to shove undeserving Bronzes into the side in the final week this time around after two bronzes deserve a spot in this week’s side. Koomson is the second after he also managed to score a hat trick. Once again it came in a 4-0 win as Sogndal cruised past Viking.
Justin Meram - LM - 70 OVR
Yet another hat trick from midfield now with Meram finding the net three times for Columbus Crew in their closely fought 3-2 away win over Montreal, who continue to struggle near the foot of the table.
Reinhold Yabo - CAM - 70 OVR
What would you know, yet another hat trick from midfield with Yabo managing it in the second division of Germany. His side went on to win 6-0 with the man himself claiming POTW.
Kamil Bilinski - ST - 68 OVR
Wroclaw came away with an impressive 6-0 win in their relegation group match-up with Ruch taking them a step closer from relegation. Bilinski was the best player on the pitch scoring three of the goals and thus makes his way into this side."

The penultimate day of the Manchester FUT Champions Cup saw two of the biggest names in FIFA esports -- Donovan ""F2TeKkz"" Hunt and Spencer ""Unilad Gorilla"" Ealing -- succumb to North American competitors. In a field traditionally dominated by European players, these were some of the biggest upsets in recent memory.
Saturday's proceedings started with the last two rounds of the group stages, which solidified the matchups for the knockout rounds. After all seven rounds, two players, one on each console, remained undefeated. 
On the Playstation side, Barcelona runner-up Nicolás “Nicolas99fc” Villalba beat FIFA Interactive World Cup runner-up Manchester City's Kai ""deto"" Wollin in the sixth round and took care of business against Marvin ""M4RV"" Hintz in the seventh to end the group stages, 7-0. Similarly, Xbox One's Javier ""Janoz"" Munoz Cordoba beat his fellow 5-0 record holder Mosaad ""Falcon Msdossary"" Aldossary in the sixth and beat Gorilla, 6-3, to match Villalba's feat.
A total of 64 players qualified for the knockout stages, and 16 remained at the end of the day. The Round of 32 saw FC Basel's Tim ""FCB TheStrxngeR"" Katnawatos, Hashtag United's ""Hashtag Agge"" Rosenmeier bow out on the Playstation side. Both competitors had established themselves as favorites after the Swiss rounds, sporting 6-1 and 5-2 records, respectively.
Hashtag's other big challenger, Ryan Pessoa, got knocked out in the Xbox Round of 32 by Nathan ""M Herozia"" Gil. Tassal ""FaZe Tass"" Rushan lost out to Martin ""RemiMartinn"" Oregel, a relatively unknown quantity coming into today. Oregel would, however, be one of the biggest storylines after his 6-4 defeat of reigning champion F2TeKkz.
Msdossary, despite slipping to a 5-2 record after a 5-0 start on Friday, continued to completely run over his opponents, scoring 13 goals and only conceding two in the first two rounds of the knockout stage. He will face RemiMartinn in one of the most hotly-contested quarterfinals on Sunday.
Niklas ""Nraseck 7"" Raseck will face Paris Saint-Germain's Lucas ""PSG DaXee"" Cuillerier. Raseck made it through to the quarterfinals after a tense 6-5 affair against Millenium's Samy   Bakhti. Cuillerier also braved a difficult road to the quarters, fending off Schalke's Tim ""S04 Tim Latka"" Schwartmann, 5-4, in their Round of 16 matchup.
Possibly the biggest upset of the competition came against Unilad Gorilla, as he lost out to Nawid ""GoalMachine"" Noorzai, another North American to make a name for himself today. Gorilla established an early 3-0 lead in the first leg, but the reigning FIWC Champion was unable to maintain his composure and the two-leg affair ended 5-4 to GoalMachine. He will face Michael ""MegaBit"" Bittner in the quarterfinals tomorrow.
Absolute madness. @_GoalMachine21 stuns Gorilla at the death to advance to the Quarterfinals in Manchester. #FIFAeWorldCup https://t.co/mBafvhJsVD pic.twitter.com/aVI1IROtgx— EA SPORTS FIFA (@EASPORTSFIFA) April 14, 2018

Kurt ""Kurt0411"" Fenech, an outspoken player known for touting his abilities, lost in the Round of 16 to M Herozia, after beating Sean ""LP Dragon""   Allen, 10-8, in a high-octane 18-goal Round of 32 match. Herozia will play Harry Hesketh, Hashtag United and the United Kingdom's only remaining competitor, in the quarterfinals.
The broadcast crew will be back Sunday morning at 7 a.m. ET for the quarterfinals of the knockout rounds. The semifinals, console finals, and the grand finals will follow. After today's events, one thing is for sure: a new player will lay claim to the FUT Champions belt.

After last week's attacking focus, we have another week of Retro Stars players which this time have a focus on wingers, and also the EPL.
We start off with a Carniball upgrade for Chelsea winger Pedro. The Spaniards original 93 rated card was very popular at the time, so an upgrade to him was almost to be expected. 97 OVR, fast, good shooting and great dribbling stats should make him a great choice for anyone who doesn't get have the 99 OVR Martial or didn't get the Ultimate TOTS Forsberg and is in need of a high rated LM. Obviously, we can't forget his boosts of +2 Short Passing and +3 Positioning which make him an excellent purchase.
After his 2 goals against Arsenal on the opening day of the season, EA decided that it was time for the Jamie Vardy Party to continue with an upgrade to his 81 RF Halloween Scream card. From one of the first promos of the game, Vardy was amazing when he was upgraded by +13 for a short time, so a Retro card going up by the same amount must be good. With many people now having Domination Ángel Di María this 94 rated RF will hopefully be quite cheap. Not to mention his boosts of +2 Finishing and +1 Positioning which will certainly add to your team. 
Finally, we have the latest in an odd trend of wingers being moved to wing back positions, with Manchester City’s second most expensive acquisition Raheem Sterling the latest player to move from left mid to left wing back. His 86 OVR Flash Freeze was very common in January and February. With his original card already having some solid stats, his upgrade to 92 OVR, along with a position change to LWB, should mean that he is given some amazing stats while giving a boost of +1 Speed and +1 Ball Control to all.
As the Retro Stars promo looks to be going for the foreseeable future, is there anyone else you want to see upgraded that hasn't been already? Let us know in the comments below!"

The football playing world's best and brightest are either off for the summer or honing their craft for their international teams. Accordingly, EA SPORTS FIFA 17 Ultimate Team's 40th installment of Team of the Week isn't exactly much to write home about.
The formula is fairly set at this point in the game's lifecycle: a player or two you might be intrigued by, a mix of real life performances that may have caught your eye if you happen to live in a country in-season, and a couple of guys who could only be loved by the most ardent collectors.
Even if you're big time into bronze or silver packs, it's a bit of a mixed blessing with only 18-men TOTWs for the foreseeable future.
It's the Summer Solstice and while it may well feel like the longest wait to get to this fall's game launch, beta will be here before you know it.
Roll on FIFA 18.
Here's the complete FUT 17 TOTW 40:

After a lengthy two-month hiatus, this weekend will mark the return of the FUT Champions Global Series, held in Manchester, one of football's biggest cities in the world. January's Barcelona cup featured one of the bigger Cinderella stories in the esport's history, with 16-year-old Donovan “DHTekKz” Hunt taking home the crown.
Hunt, as well as the Barcelona runner-up, Nicolás “Nicolas99fc” Villalba will return in Manchester to stake their claim and solidify their reputation as the world's best, but they'll obviously have some stiff competition.
UNILAD esport's top notch duo of Shaun ""Shellzz"" Springette and 2017 FIWC Champion Spencer ""Gorilla"" Ealing will return. Springette finished as the runner-up in last year's FIFA 17 Ultimate Team Championship Berlin Grand Final.
Kai ""deto"" Wollin, who lost out to Gorilla in the FIWC final last year, will also feature. Spencer ""Spencer FC"" Owen's Hashtag United will field a five-man team in Manchester. ""Hashtag Ryan"" Pessoa is a player that is poised for a deep tournament run. ""Hashtag Agge"" Rosenmeier, formerly of Paris Saint-Germain, has been a staple in the competitive esports scene as well. ""Hashtag Harry"" Hesketh and Ivan ""Hashtag Boras"" Lapanje will also try to make their mark, along with newcomer Adam ""Hashtag dreamR"" Barton.
Lucas ""PSG DaXee"" Cuillerier is back, and so is Tassal ""FaZe Tass"" Rushan, the Paris Regional Final winner from last year. German club Schalke will field the duo of Tim ""S04 Tim Latka"" Schwartmann and Lukas ""S04 Idealz"" Schmandt. FC Basel's Tim ""FCB TheStrxngeR"" Katnawatos, who has always been a dark horse candidate in former competitions, is back as well.
The top 16 players from Manchester, i.e. the top eight from each console, will move on to qualify for the Global Series playoffs. This tournament will follow the same Swiss structure that was used in Barcelona, a departure from the format used in last year's FIFA Ultimate Team Championship and the FIFA Interactive World Cup. If you need a refresher on how things will play out, here's how it works.
Every match between two players, including the Knockout Stage matches and the Grand Final, will be played over two legs. The player with the higher aggregate score will be declared the winner, but, if the scoreline remains tied after two games, extra-time and penalties will decide the winner.
The Group Stage will be broken up by console, and the players will be seeded based on their qualifying results. What this means is that the No. 1 seed from Xbox One will play the No. 64 seed, and so on; the same goes for the flip side, with PlayStation competitors. After the first match based on the seedings, players will then be matched up against others with the same win-loss record. No player will face the same opponent twice. The competitors will have the chance to play up to seven matches in the Group Stage, or 14 games in total. Four wins from seven matches will ensure entry into the Knockout rounds, but if a player loses four matches, they will immediately be eliminated from the competition.
The Knockout Stage is relatively simple. The 32 players to advance from each console will be seeded into a single-elimination bracket based on their win-loss record from the Group Stage. At the end, only two players will remain, one from Xbox One and one from PlayStation, and they will go on to play each other in the cross-console Grand Final. In the Grand Final, one game will be played on each console and the player with the higher aggregate score will be declared the champion and get to take home 22,000 dollars.
The tournament will kick-off on Friday at 7 a.m. ET with the Group Stage, and can be viewed on Twitch.
The broadcast crew will be back Saturday morning at 7 a.m. ET for the Knockout Rounds. For a more fleshed-out look at the entire weekend's schedule, you can go here. Extended coverage and behind-the-scenes action can be found on EA's Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat channels."

                        Onto the French league now and with Monaco upsetting the odds there are a fair few featuring.
                    

Formation: 4-4-2
Squad Link:  http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/6358175/

Goalkeeper
Stephane Ruffier - GK - 85 OVR
The keepers were much more difficult to select in comparison to other leagues I have already done but Ruffier is the stand out one. Etienne have conceded just the 37 goals this season which is the fourth best defensive record. For a team in 8th position of which have struggled to score goals just shows how important the defensive side is to them. Ruffier has been a huge part of that and thus makes the cut.
Defenders
Benjamin Mendy - LB - 75 OVR
The first of many Monaco players to make my side is Mendy. Arguably the weakest selected but with a lack of LB options if 4-4-2 is opted for I expect him to be included. The French defender has five assists to his name to go alongside Monaco's defense which reads the second best in the division.
Thiago Silva - CB - 89 OVR
Thiago Silva narrowly missed out on a TOTY inclusion and rightfully so in truth. There is little doubt about him remaining among the elite defenders in the world though and with another decent season under his belt for PSG he should be making this side with his eyes closed.
Kamil Glik- CB - 84 OVR
Monaco''s defensive side of the game has always been what has stood out for them and although they have added goals which has been a key factor in their title win the defensive side has still been there. Glik helps towards that defensive record however largely contributes in attack as well managing six goals and two assists. 
Dijibril Sidibe - RB - 80 OVR
Yet another Monaco defender now with Sidibe. He made the move from LB to RB and has continued his performances to the top standard. He has two goals and four assists to his name which is more than respectable but once again it is his defensive display which helps stand out
Midfielders
Thomas Lemar - LM - 80 OVR
Monaco have produced a lot of exciting youth players over recent years and Lemar is another one. Arguably the stand out player in Ligue 1 this season contributing in most games he played from the left side of midfield. The youngster only played 26 games for Monaco this season but with 9 goals and 8 assists to his name he is pretty much locked down for this side.
Marco Verratti - CM - 85 OVR
Despite only picking up three goals and five assists Veratti remains one of the highest rated players in the division. There is good reason for that with the role the Italian plays in the side. You only have to watch PSG to realise just how good he is. There is no doubt surrounding his place in this side.
Fabinho - CDM - 80 OVR
Fabinho was played primarily in a central role this season over a RB role which he had previously operated in and has developed into one of the best central midfielders in the league. The Brazilian scored eight goals for Monaco and although most of them came from the spot he does a lot more for the champions and deserves recognition for that.
Florian Thauvin - RW - 81 OVR
You only need to look that Thauvin's FIFA ratings to realise the season he’s had. The 23-year-old started at just a 77 rating and I now sitting on 88 with a TOTS yet to come. 15 goals and 8 assists is what the Marseille winger currently sits on and is now likely to become one of the hot prospects over the summer.
Forwards
Edinson Cavani - ST - 86 OVR
Ibra was always going to be some tough shoes to fill but with Cavani at the club PSG knew they had someone capable of doing so. He has lived up to the task scoring a remarkable 35 goals in the 34 games he has played, making him the league’s top goal scorer by nine goals. 
Alexandre Lacazette - ST - 85 OVR
Another familiar face now with Lyon's Lacazette. The French striker has been patchy this season and although he has not been as impressive as he has been in the past with 26 goals to his name you can't deny his importance to Lyon. Maybe not as good as some people make out but he would do a job for just about anyone.
Substitutes
Yohann Pele - GK - 74 OVR
This spot could go to one of many but with recent performances going in his favour Pele becomes a very viable option. Marseille have conceded 41 goals in the 37 games they have played which although is not as impressive as some sides still deserves recognition and it would have been more if it were not for Pele.
Loic Perrin- CB - 82 OVR
I have already mentioned that St Etienne have an impressive defensive record for their position in the table and Perrin is another player who has helped towards that. Perrin also has offensive stats to his game though managing to score four of his own, making him one of the best defensive options in Ligue 1
Bernardo Silva - RM - 82 OVR
There was a stage when Silva was in line for a TOTW item every week and although he has significantly slowed down on that front he has still been a big part of Monaco’s season. The winger has tallied up eight goals and nine assists now which in 32 games for a wide midfielder is a good tally to have.
Ryad Boudebouz - CAM - 00 OVR
Outside of the obvious sides once again it was Boudebouz who was among the best performers. The Algerian has continued to perform in the top division of France for Montpellier and with eleven goals and nine assists to his name makes this side with ease.
Jean Michael Seri- CM - 80 OVR
Seri has always been a decent enough but has really come into his own for Nice this season, helping them for a serious title push. The Ivorian added attacking contributions to his game with six goals and nine assists which has really helped him stand out.
Bafetimbi Gomis - ST - 78 OVR
The weakest striker of those selected is Gomis but with 19 goals to his name will probably be included in the final side. His importance to Marseille shouldn't be overlooked though with the French striker scoring a third of his club’s goals.
Falcao - ST - 82 OVR
Falcao received a lot of stick for his performances in the EPL but he has shown this season that he still has it in his locker. He was Monaco's highest goal scorer with 21 to his name in their title winning season. The Colombian still has a few years left in him and I wouldn't be surprised if another big side came in for him.
Reserves
Dante - CB - 81 OVR
Nice were another side with a defensive record worth talking about, only conceding 33 goals in 37 games they played. Dante was always a decent enough player in Germany and has proved to be a brilliant signing for Nice in Ligue 1 now. It's all about his defensive performances for his selection here and can be backed up by his regular high scores from L'equipe.
Morgan Sanson - CDM - 80 OVR
Sanson found his way into MC which significantly helps his chances and I probably wouldn't have included him if it was not for that. The midfielder does have a goal and seven assists to his name but in truth in comparison to the other options available it’s a tough call.
 Blaise Matuidi- CM - 86 OVR
Matuidi has not been mentioned as much as previous years but he has still done a job in the middle for PSG. After all it's not like PSG were bad this season but instead it was Monaco and Nice who both excelled. Just the four goals and four assists to his name however like many players in his position that is not where he’s best.
Lucas - RW - 82 OVR
A bit of a punt now but seeing as Lucas has 12 goals and 5 assists to his name he does stand out in general. He seems to have come from nowhere with the Brazilian failing to be even mentioned for the TOTW process until the most recent week but with those offensive stats he leads outside of the ST options.
Kylian Mbappe Lottin - ST - 71 OVR
When it comes to young talents across the world, Mbappe is among the very best in terms of names right now. The 17-year-old striker produced sheer magic in Ligue 1 across the whole campaign with 14 goals and 8 assists to his name in limited starts there is no wonder several of Europe's top clubs are after him
Extra player
Marcal - LB - 76 OVR
I was wrong with the extra player coming in the form of an SBC but still it looks as though 24 players will be continued. Although it's unlikely to be a LB with the way I have done this Marcal is the player I would have otherwise left out. The Brazilian has impressive offensive stats with 7 assists to his name but while playing for Guingamp his defensive record is not the best."

UPDATE: Thanks to all who participated! The Futhead FIFA 18 TOTY ballot is officially cast. 

Original post:
The hype is real.
After plenty of gossip, rumors, innuendo, and everything we’ve come to expect in the lead up to massive FIFA Ultimate Team events, it’s finally here. Breaking ranks with tradition, which had previously seen the FIFPro World XI released as the “Team of the Year”, with those awards moving to October, EA SPORTS’ FIFA team will be christening a TOTY of their very own -- and we’re making sure you have a say in it.
The EA SPORTS FIFA Team of the Year will be selected by a collective made up of community influencers, media, and professional athletes, as well as EA themselves. We want to make sure the community has a say in the process, so we're letting you choose who we vote for.
With voting closing this Thursday, January 11, let’s get right into it, shall we?
So how does TOTY work in FIFA 18?
55 players have been shortlisted. While similar, they’re not identical to the FIFPro World XI’s shortlist.
You can check out the full shortlist here, view Aaron and Darren’s predictions respectively, and starting at 7 p.m. UK time/2 p.m. ET time on January 8, cast your vote for the three attackers, three midfielders, four defensive players, and one goalkeeper who you think should make up the team. We’ll sum your votes up, add in our staff’s ballots, and announce our final vote here and on Twitter Thursday, January 11 after 7 p.m. UK time.
Cast your vote for Futhead's TOTY ballot here.
What time does the FIFA TOTY come out in packs?
The rest of the specifics aren’t 100% set in stone yet, but you should expect the first installment of Team of the Year players out beginning January 15. Based on previous years, two days will feature the attackers in packs, with one or two days a piece for the midfielders and defenders/goalkeeper to be available. That weekend, the whole squad will likely be in packs. We’ll update more as we have it.
Who votes in TOTY?
Well you, for starters. We’ll try and keep a running tab as well of all the community influencers, media representatives, and pro athletes making up the rest of the vote as well. Tweet us @Futhead if you see someone and we’ll add them as we learn about them:

With rumors swirling about Team of the Year potentially coming in the weeks ahead, it's a good time to survey the FIFA landscape. What's FIFA 18 done well? What are its failures? What are our personal highlights a little less than a third of the way through the game's natural lifecycle?
Our Luke and FUT Economist (aka Jamey) team up with the folks over at the FUT Weekly Podcast to talk all of that and more including ""skill gap"" -- what is it, why is it so misunderstood, and how is it impacting the state of FUT Champs? -- plus pre-TOTY (assuming it's coming soon) trading tips from Jamey and analysis of the latest Team of the Week (our picks as well as some hidden gems).

The leaks were as advertised.
Prime Thierry Henry,  Rio Ferdinand, Roberto Carlos, and Romanian legend Gheorghe Hagi are all here, just in time for America's Thanksgiving Holiday.
The Prime Icon Squad Building Challenges requirements, as available in Futhead's SBC section, are doozies, as per usual. Henry in particular is extremely steep, requiring 3 Icons and 88 and 89 overall rated squads. But with a tradeable item (made evident from the ones that somehow made it to market early) price cap of around 1.2 million coins for the likes of Ferdinand, will the market dictate a more favorable peak cost for some of the other untradeable versions?
The best may be yet to come with pack offerings and potential flash Squad Building Challenges tomorrow. For those new to FIFA (and/or FUT's Black Fridays), there hasn't particularly been discounted priced packs in the past, but a greater variety (typically 50k, 100k, or perhaps even 125k) made available for a quantity-limited time only. We'll have to see what tomorrow brings."

No leaks (that we were aware of anyway). And other than the general sense that the lull in the FIFA calendar pre-an expected Team of the Year could yield something, no real concrete expectations for a definite content release today.
While not quite #ExpectTheUnexpected, we did manage to get a couple gems on Friday in Calcio A League Squad Building Challenge Marek Hamsik and MLS League SBC Sebastian Giovinco. The Slovakian sensation will be an immediate boon to Italian League sides, while the Atomic Ant should be able to strong link nicely with End of an Era Andrea Pirlo.
Both SBCs are available immediately and through the end of this year's game's lifecycle. Kudos to those of you that planned in advance and will be able to complete all the teams involved on the relative cheap. For the rest of us, it may not be a bad time to check out what our MLS and Calcio A players are going for and consider punting on doing these in the interim in exchange for some easy coins.

Parting is such sweet sorrow.
While FIFA Ultimate Team 17's Team of the Season feels like it's dragged a bit -- there weren't quite enough unique Squad Building Challenges, new pack offerings, and Ligue 1 arguably barely deserved its own promotion -- there's one last bang until we do it all again next year (yes, yes; we know, MLS fans).
The annual Ultimate Team of the Season (formerly known as ""EAFC TOTS"") showcases 23 of the best players from over the course of the past six weeks, re-released and back in packs altogether at the same time. For the second time in as many weeks, the fine social people at EA SPORTS FIFA Turkey gave us a bit of a sneak peak as to what's hitting FUT 17 this weekend. The usual suspects are all there -- hello, 99 OVR Ronaldo and Messi -- plus a couple breakout stars from the past domestic league seasons.
If you've still got disposable income left after all the lightning rounds of the past month and change, there certainly are some big fish to potentially reel in.

Make your voice heard! Vote for the FIFA 18 Community TOTS on Futhead

As you'll no doubt have gathered from today's big announcement and Aaron’s post as well, EA have decided to follow a similar model they used for TOTY by allowing the community to have their say on who they want to see get a big upgrade.
With there only being one Community TOTS this year, this team is going to be made up of a mix of bronzes, silvers and golds, and I anticipate a similar sort of split to what happens in Team of the Weeks.
So, let's get into my picks and recommendations for who I think will get in, and who deserves it most.


Jan Oblak - We start off with a relatively easy pick in my eyes. The Atletico Madrid keeper has had another fine season, helping take his side to the semi-finals of the Europa League as well as second in La Liga. In his 31 league appearances this season, he has managed to keep 19 clean sheets and conceded just 15 goals. Although a lot of credit has to go to the back line in front of him, there is no doubting how good he has been throughout the season, with his excellent average of just under 2 stars per game over the course of the season. 
Ben Davies - In the full Premier League TOTS, the left back spot is perhaps the most difficult to fill. One of the best candidates for that spot is Spurs left back. With Danny Rose suffering from persistent injuries, the Welshman has taken full advantage and established himself as one of the most consistent full backs in the league. Often operating as a roaming wing back, he hasn’t been as good as some others going forward, but his defensive contributions that make him stand out ahead of the crowd. With 11 clean sheets in his 25 appearances and only 20 conceded, he has helped keep Spurs defence as solid as last season despite various injury problems throughout the season.
James Tarkowski - After breaking into Burnley’s first team last season, he has made himself a mainstay in the team. His importance to Burnley is undeniable, and his constant excellent performances have helped Burnley keep the fourth best defensive record in the league, despite the club having one of the lowest budgets in the league. His performances have attracted the attention of both the Polish and English FA’s, before he decided upon playing for England and will no doubt be on the plane to Russia in a couple of months time.
Gerard Pique - Another year, another excellent season for Barcelona. The Spanish giants have been almost impossible to catch this season, only dropping points four times throughout the season. Although he may not be as dominant as he has been in the past, there is no denying how important the veteran Spaniard is to the team, with Umtiti’s growth and improvement no doubt partly due to his influence. He may only have two goals this season, but he isn't as renowned for his attacking threat as the likes of his national team defensive partner Ramos. A deserved inclusion.
Philipp Max - Another year, another emerging star in the Bundesliga whose career has gone from strength to strength this past year. Operating mainly as a left wing back or left back, his attacking threat is what makes him stand out stats wise, with a league high 12 assists, but his defensive work has also been a big help in keeping Augsburg well clear of the relegation zone. On Kicker, he has the best rating of all left backs in the league with 3.07, and has featured in their TOTW an impressive five times in 29 games. Not a bad season for a 24 year old who is in his first full season as a full first team starter.
Aviles Hurtado - For my next pick, we head over to Mexico and to Monterrey. Although his form hasn’t been as good in the Clausura as it was in the Apertura, he played a key role in helping his side top the Apertura. Scoring 11 goals in the first half of the season, his performances and contributions were a big part of that success and his importance is showing now more than ever. A slight loss in form for him has seen Monterrey’s performances drop as a whole and they currently sit fifth in the Clausura with three games to go. He has failed to contribute in just 11 of the 26 games he has played, and averaged a goal contribution every 108 minutes.
Javi Martinez - Since Lahm’s retirement back in 2014, Bayern have been searching for someone who can occupy the space he left both at right back and, more recently, CDM. Joshua Kimmich proved a great find to fill in at full back, but it has taken a couple of years and a change in manager for Javi Martinez to establish himself as their first choice CDM. The big Spaniard has proven to be a revelation under Jupp Heynckes, moving back into the position where he played a lot in his early career after being benched by Carlo Ancelotti at the start of the season. Constantly breaking up plays and quickly turning defence into attack, as well as being comfortable on the ball and slowing things down, he currently ranks on Kicker as the fourth best midfielder in the league behind Lars Bender, Leon Bailey and teammate James Rodriguez, showing just how good he has been.
Geoffrey Kondogbia - Valencia may be on track to cause a massive upset and force Real Madrid down into a fourth place finish in La Liga, with the Spanish giants currently a point behind Valencia. Valencia’s impressive record, including an unbeaten run that lasted from the start of the season until December, saw them sit just a just behind Barcelona for long periods at the start of the season. A lot of that success is due to their solid defence, which Kondogbia helps lead from just ahead of them alongside Parejo. With 4 goals and 4 assists, he is a danger going forward as well, and the level of his performances shows by the fact that he is rated as one of the best midfielders in the league, with WhoScored ranking him just behind Kroos and Casemiro and ahead of the likes of Saul, Modric and Busquets - who is also on the shortlist for this TOTS.
Jose Callejon - Although he wasn’t able to replicate his performances from last season, which saw him score and assist 14 goals, he has still proven vital to Napoli’s title challenge. Napoli have won every game he has scored or assisted this season in all competitions and, although he has played a lesser part this season compared to Insigne and Mertens, the trio have been almost unstoppable once again this season. His average Gazzetta rating of 6.19 is not amazing, but is nothing to be scoffed at as well.
Jamie Vardy - The party returns for another year with the Leicester man returning to form to help Leicester get back into the top half of the league. Vardy may not have reached his excellent form from their title winning season, having only scored twice in one game this season, but with 17 goals so far this season, he has proved vital to Leicester this season. With this being a community vote, and Vardy being a big FUT favourite, that only adds to his claim for a spot in the TOTS.
Sebastian Giovinco - This was perhaps the toughest spot in the team for me to pick, with the other strikers all seeming fairly obvious, I was torn between Giovinco, a FUT Favourite, and Bendtner, who I feel could earn a lot of votes purely because he is ‘Lord Bendtner’. I have opted for the Italian as he helped Toronto made up for their loss in the previous MLS Cup final by beating Seattle in a rematch of the final this year. He was their star player of the season was without a doubt, running defences riot once again. Despite being plagued by injuries throughout the season, he still managed to score 17 and set up another 7, averaging a contribution just over every 100 minutes. Of the six games Toronto lost last season, Giovinco was out injured for two and failed to score or assist in the other four, showing just how important for the Canadian side he is. 

Alisson - After Julio Cesar’s retirement from the Brazilian national team, they were lacking an obvious successor. Step up Roma stopper Alisson. Since his €7.5m move from Internacional back in summer 2016 he has improved massively, even ousting former Arsenal keeper Wojciech Szczesny from the first team. With a clean sheet roughly every other game and conceding just 26 goals in 31 games, he has been a key part to Roma’s success this season which was topped off by their recent comeback against Barcelona.
Kieran Tierney - This spot was one of the last I filled, as I simply couldn’t decide between Tierney and Chiellini. The Italian veteran hasn’t played for large parts of this season, but his influence and consistency has helped Juve to what looks like another league title. However, my Scottish bias couldn’t tempt me away from Celtic’s constantly improving left back. He has shown his ability to play anywhere across the back line, something he has done several times this season for club and country, as well as in a more advanced wing back role. He has shown experience far beyond his years, and puts in high standard performances almost every week, with solid defensive displays and also making valuable contributions going forward. His ability to compete at the top level is in no doubt, and with a host of big clubs rumoured to be interested, Manchester United being the latest rumoured to have stepped up their interest, it can’t be long until he starts making a name for himself at one of the top teams somewhere in Europe.
Presnel Kimpembe - At the start of the season, I doubt many people would have suspected that the 22 year old was going to be PSG’s main defender this season, but that is how things have turned out. Although he is still considered their third choice centre back behind Marquinhos and Thiago Silva, and has been benched several times because of them, he has played the most minutes out of the trio. With L’Equipe still being used as the main source in Ligue 1, and the French paper ranking him as the second best player in the entire league, it shows just how good he has been this year.
Marco van Ginkel - After joining Chelsea at the age of 20, van Ginkel had a hard time breaking into a midfield with the likes of Lampard, Ramires and Oscar. Various loan spells later, he has finally found form back in his homeland playing for PSV Eindhoven, where he has been made club captain. After a disappointing third place finish last season, PSV look set to win their third league title in four years, and could even do it today if they beat second place Ajax at home. With 14 goals and 4 assists, he has led by example and, along with the extremely talented Hirving Lozano, helped carry PSV to the top of the table.
Ruud Vormer - A great season for the Dutchman has helped Club Brugge to a healthy lead at the top of the Championship group in the Pro League. With an impressive 10 goals and 15 assists from CM, he has been involved in 37% of his teams goals this season, which have helped his team pick up an impressive 18 extra points. He will be a well deserved inclusion and one that will no doubt be fairly cheap with some excellent IG stats to match his big rating increase.
Lee Jae Sung - I have gone with a bit of an unknown player to many for this spot. Lee Jae Sung helped carry Jeonbuk Motors to their third league title in four seasons, providing excellent performances from midfield. Voted the league MVP last year, it shows just how highly rated he was throughout the season, and with 8 goals and 12 assists during the normal season and the playoffs, averaging a goal contribution every 117 minutes, there is no doubting that he deserves a spot in the team.
Camillo Ciano - The Italian winger has shone since moving to Frosinone last summer. After his successful year back in 2014/15, which saw him get a TOTS MC card, he has had another great season. With 11 goals and 15 assists, he has been a revelation this season and helped Frosinone to be in with a chance of promotion to Serie A after being relegated two years ago. Ciano has played a vital role in their success, with his contributions helping them gain another 27 points. There is little doubt that he thoroughly deserves a spot in the team.
Alireza Jahanbakhsh - The Iranian winger is having a fine season, boasting the best average rating on VI (6.64) and the second best on WhoScored (8.15), behind only the Moroccan playmaker Ziyech. With a strong 15 goals and 10 assists this season, he sits third in the goalscoring charts and also the assist charts which have no doubt played a massive part in AZ Alkmaar’s impressive season that sees them sit 11 points ahead of last season’s champions Feyenoord and needing just two points to guarantee themselves a Champions League qualifier next season.
Moussa Marega - With five games left to play, Porto sit just one point behind Benfica, who they play this weekend in what could easily be a title deciding game. An average rating of just under 7 from A Bola, mainly thanks to his 20 goals and 3 assists, the Porto striker has played a key part in their title challenge this season. Throughout the season, the longest he went without being involved in a goal was just two games, which in an incredible feat. 
Burak Yilmaz - Yilmaz is one of only nine players to cross the divide between the three Turkish giants, but it as his current side Trabzonspor that he is currently tearing up defences. Although age may be starting to catch up with him and injuries starting to become more common, he has only missed six games all season, but is still averaging a goal a game. With the Super Lig being very close in the mid-table, a top quality goalscorer can be the difference between survival and relegation in a season and Yilmaz is that difference. His goals and assists have gathered his side an extra 16 points this season, and his influence on the team is most obvious looking at one simple stat:- Goals per game with him playing v without him playing: 2.1 v 0.67
Jaime Mata - What a season the Real Valladolid striker is having. After a disappointing season last year, he has completely turned things around this season. 32 games, 26 goals and 5 assists later, he has helped carry his side to a comfortable mid-table position by single handedly getting them another 27 points, without which they would be almost doomed for relegation already. There have been a couple of occasions where he may have had a chance of getting an IF, but his overall form and consistency makes him almost guaranteed to make the side.
Adebayo Akinfenwa - Beast Mode was definitely turned on this year as a FUT favourite from a few years ago found form once again. With his second highest goal tally in his career of 17, and his highest ever assists count of 14, he should be a guarantee for a spot in the TOTS based on his performances and contributions alone. Those goals and assists have helped earn Wycombe an extra 28 points which have helped them push for promotion.

So that’s who I think will get in the TOTS. With this being a community vote once again, it may be difficult to predict what will happen, but I hope that both of the predictions posted can help show how we feel best to vote."

Last week's score: 14/23
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad link: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/6595409/

Goalkeeper
Bill Hamid - GK - 76 OVR
There was literally one option for a gold keeper this week and that comes with Hamid who made four saves in DC United's 1-0 win. Very little competition and I would assume EA would want a gold keeper.
Defenders
Rafael Toloi - CB - 75 OVR
All of the defenders are pretty much punts this week with none officially standing out. Toloi played well defensively for Atalanta in their 1-0 win claiming a 7/10 for doing so.
Lorenzo De Silvestri - RB - 78 OVR
Torino played out a 5-3 win this weekend and any of about 5 players from either side could actually make the cut. I have opted for De Silvestri simply because he is a defender who scored.
Miguel Lopes - RB - 78 OVR
Lopes was unlucky that he played on a Monday last week else he would have made the cut. This time he played on a Sunday though and thus with his goal in a 3-0 win he looks set to be included
Midfielders
Lorenzo Insigne - LW - 84 OVR
Its been a while since Insigne featured in TOTW despite consistently performing to a high level. He continued his good form this week with another goal and assist in Napoli's 4-2 away win claiming a huge 8.5 from Gazzetta
Victor Vazquez - CM - 75 OVR
Vazquez is a gold which can fall under the category of actually deserving his spot in this side. The Spaniard scored two of Toronto's five goals in their 5-0 win
Anderson Talisca - CAM - 76 OVR
The first of two Besiktas players I have opted for this week in Talisca after he scored both the third and fourth goals in a 4-0 win for them
Oguzhan Ozyakup - CDM - 81 OVR
As mentioned with Talisca I selected two from Besiktas's 4-0 win and the second of those players is Ozyakup. I believe Talisca is the best option but with a goal and assist to his name Ozyakup also stands strong
Forwards
Edin Dzeko - ST - 81 OVR
A little bit of a punt with Dzeko seeing as he has a lot of special items alongside also recently being included however with him being a big name in a quiet week a brace and an assist could well be enough for him.
Samuel Eto'o - ST - 81 OVR
Eto'o only got a goal and assist in his sides comfortable with however with the lack of gold options and Eto'o being a relatively big name I can see preference being given towards him. 87  rated should this happen, prime FIFA memories
Eder - ST - 80 OVR
One player with no risk of picking up a TOTS item is Eder however the Italian does look set for TOTW after picking up two goals and an assist during Inter Milans 5-2 win (edited)
Substitutes
Bobby Shuttleworth - GK - 68 OVR
Keepers and defenders were nigh on impossible to select this week and thus we continue with the punts. Shuttleworth made 7 saves
In total during a 1-0 win over Orlando City.
Fabio Pisacane - RB - 65 OVR
Pisacane managed to score a 93rd minute winner in order to help Cagliarli to a 2-1 win over AC Milan. He picked up a 7.5 from Gazzetta for his efforts
Andrea Nalini - LM - 64 OVR
Crotones Nalini managed to pick up player of the week in Italy after he bagged himself two goals in their surprise 3-1 win over Lazio he was rewarded with a huge 9/10 making his chances pretty much 100%
Alexander Grunwald - CM - 70 OVR
Austria Vienna picked up a dominant 6-1 win on Sunday from which Grunwald particularly starred in scoring twice and assisting another.
German Denis - ST - 75 OVR
With golds being needed many strikers with braces look set to make the cut this week. Denis is one of those after he scored both goals in a 2-0 win.
Giovani Dos Santos - ST - 79 OVR
This is the time when the MLS gets flooded with IFs and GDS looks set to pick up his first after the Mexican grabbed a brace during Galaxy's 4-2 win
Quique - ST - 72 OVR
With Quique already picking up a 74 silver IF he has a huge advantage as it now makes him a gold should he get in again. With a brace to his name in a 2-0 Almeria win
Reserves
Ryan Delaney - CB - 53 OVR
There were a couple of defenders with two goals in Ireland this week however considering that Delaney's goals helped his side to a 4-1 win I can see him being selected over the other options
Kevin Walker - CM - 66 OVR
Some places have Walker down as scoring three while others have him with just the two. Either way he stands a brilliant chance of making the cut for his contribution in his sides 4-1 home win
Ikechukwu Uche - ST - 74 OVR
I have selected a few from the second division of Spain this week which could be pushing it bit with several top performances it become difficult to ignore them. Uche joins that list after he received multiple plaudits for his brace and assist.
Erling Knudtzon - ST - 68 OVR
One of the easiest selections this week by some distance comes with Knudtzon who scored three goals in Lillestroms 4-1 win.
Marco Paixao - ST - 70 OVR
Ending with a hat trick now after Paixao grabbed three of his sides four goals in a 4-0 win. It will be interesting to see what EA decide to do with FUT champ rewards requirements"

FUT Champions/The Weekend League was widely celebrated when introduced in the lead up to FIFA 17. A chance to prove yourself amongst your peers -- and perhaps even competitive FUT's elite. Some very solid (on paper) rewards, weekly and monthly, to boot. And if nothing else, a seemingly compelling reason to play more (and ostensibly higher quality) FIFA than ever before.
Flash forward to a year later. Is too much of a good thing at the root of the current burn out, high stress, animosity, and toxicity prevalent on social medias amongst the game's pros, influencers (YouTubers and streamers), and power users in the community at the moment?
The podcast's founding duo of Ben and Horace are joined by regular Jamey, better known as FUT Economist, in an episode well worth making time for this weekend. Make sure you add to the conversation in the comments below and/or on Twitter.

            Updated on
            



Three out of four last week put me back on the right track after a couple of disappointing weeks, so let’s hope this week is just as good!
The big game this week is the Battle of the Borussia’s in Germany, as Monchengladbach host Dortmund in what looks set to be a close game. So, let’s get into this week's games.
Torino v Juventus
The ‘Derby della Mole’ or Turin derby sees ninth place Torino host their far more successful rivals Juventus.
Torino have been in good form recently, with three wins and two draws in their last five games. New signing Nicolas N’Koulou has proved vital in improving their defensive solidity, while Niang, Falque and Belotti have offered some attacking potential. If Serie A started in January, then Torino would be in fourth place, behind only Napoli, AC Milan and, of course, Juventus in the form table.
Juventus are still keeping very close tabs on league leaders Napoli, and only conceded for the first time this year in their Champions League draw with Spurs on Tuesday. Since they last lost, they have a goal differential of 33:3 in 17 games, with just three draws in the process. Safe to say they are in decent form and massive favourites for this game.
It should come as no surprise that Juventus are dominant in this fixture, with Torino having won the tie just once and drawn three since 2002 -- out of 20 games. So, it should come as no surprise that I can see this game being an easy win for Juventus.
Game time: Sunday 18th, 11:30 a.m. (GMT) / 6:30 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Juventus win

Borussia Monchengladbach v Borussia Dortmund
I’ll try and keep any bias I may have in this game to a minimum. Both teams are almost always there or thereabouts when it comes to the business end of the season, so a good game is almost certainly on the cards.
Gladbach proved me wrong last time when I said they would get a positive result against RB Leipzig, but they lost and are now on a three game losing streak. Having finished a disappointing 9th last season, they will be hoping to improve on that and get back amongst the European qualification places again.
Gladbach’s poor league finish last season could prove to be their advantage this time round, with Dortmund now having to play on Thursday nights in the Europa League. With their squad beginning to near full strength again, with the return of Reus last weekend, and Batshuayi hitting the ground running after his loan move, it seems that they are becoming a side to be wary of once again. It remains to be seen how strong a side Peter Stöger will put out against Atalanta on Thursday, but a full strength side may mean some tired legs could be forced into a full 90 minutes on Sunday as well.
I would recommend waiting until after their Europa League tie has been played before predicting this game, to see who plays or may get injured. Right now, I believe that Dortmund hold the upper hand, having only lost to Bayern in the Pokal in their last 10 games, so they are in great form and hoping to keep the pressure up on second placed RB Leipzig. 
Game time: Sunday 18th, 5:00 p.m. (GMT) / 12:00 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Dortmund win

Real Betis v Real Madrid
After finishing last season a dismal 15th, Real Betis will be hoping they can keep this seasons form up, as they sit just outside the Europa League qualification spots. Their recent signing of Marc Bartra from Dortmund should solidify their leaky defence -- the joint third worst in the league -- while also providing much needed experience at the top level which they will be hoping can help others perform at a higher level and keep their European push going. 
Real Madrid’s Champions League dominance looked like it was going to stall on Wednesday night, but two goals from Ronaldo and a late one from Marcelo saw them take the advantage into their second leg in Paris in a couple of weeks time, leading 3-1 on aggregate. 
Betis managed a shock 1-0 win in the Bernabeu back in September, but now that Real’s form has drastically improved, I can’t see Los Blancos failing to pick up the three points this weekend.
Game time: Sunday 18th, 7:45 p.m. (GMT) / 2:45 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Real Madrid win

Nice v Nantes
Lastly we go to France, where Nantes and Nice face off in a mid-table scrap. With the top four teams already seeming to have been decided, Nantes and Nice are in the pack just behind them who are battling over nothing more than pride and prize money. 
Nice were involved in some controversy last weekend when Balotelli was booked for complaining to the referee about alleged racism from fans during Nice’s 3-2 loss to Dijon. That loss was their third in a row, so they will be hoping to end that run and get back to winning ways. Their home form has been good though, with six wins in their last nine games - all by either 1-0 or 3-1 scorelines.
Nantes are at the top of the pack but are also in poor form with just one win in their last seven games. They have been scoring highly, just their defence has been shocking -- scoring seven and conceding five in their last three games with one win, one draw and one loss showing just how unpredictable they have been.
Nice have had the slight advantage in terms of head-to-head results recently, winning two of the last three. I can see this game ending in stalemate, with both teams weaknesses cancelling each other out, but I think that Nice may edge the game and take the three points.
Game time: Sunday 18th, 2:00 p.m. (GMT) / 9:00 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Nice win

That’s what I think will happen this week. A perfect 4/4 will give you the tough choice between a CAM or LW Marco Reus for four tokens, or splitting it between an 82 LM or LF Thorgan Hazard for two tokens each, or 150k coins for a single token, so some great rewards are on offer.
As always, let us know in the comments what you’re predicting, and make sure to follow us on Twitter to keep updated with all the scores over the course of the weekend.
Good luck and happy predicting!"

As we near the end of one of the longest running programs in FIFA Mobile this year, it is time for a Prediction on who will make the ‘Ultimate XI’ - the 11 players whose upgrade plans have been completed the most by us players. The plans for these players may be unknown just now, but I expect they will involve a variety of league TOTS tokens, trophies and/or gold and elite players, along with the item you are upgrading and either 1, 2 or 3 upgrade tokens depending on their rating, with the reward being an untradeable player rated between 97 and 99. 
So without further ado, let's get into who I believe will be the Ultimate XI:

Manuel Neuer
After yet another solid season for Bayern, Neuer had more clean sheets than goals conceded. As a firm fan favourite in both real life and FM, he is one of the toughest keepers to score against, and I can't see him not making it into the Ultimate XI as rival Gigi Buffon looks less likely due to the other three Serie A upgrades being more desirable. 
Predicted Rating: 95 → 97
Thiago Silva
Many people will know just how good the Carniball version of Silva is, so it should come as little surprise that people have been trying to recreate that card with his TOTS. As the only 96-rated defender, his value should be even higher than normal, so I expect him to make it into the Ultimate XI. 
Predicted Rating: 96 → 99 
Cesar Azpilicueta
I have to admit this spot was fairly open, with no fewer than three possible candidates for it. I went with Azpilicueta over his teammate Alonso and Brazil left back Filipe Luis, as I feel that his plan has been more popular, due to many people already owning the untradeable Attack Mode Alaba and Rose at LWB and LB respectively. 
Predicted Rating: 95 → 98
Kalidou Koulibaly
As the Ultimate XI is down to the popularity of plans completed, I can see the Senegalese defender ranking very highly due to his insane stats, as well as Serie A being a very popular choice of team in the game. 
Predicted Rating:94 → 97
Lionel Messi
Was there ever any doubt that Messi would get a 99-rated item at some point this year? After being arguably the player of the year in Europe, with yet another Golden Boot award, he looks set to get an upgrade better than his TOTY card as he gets a 99 overall TOTS in the Ultimate XI. 
Predicted Rating:: 96 → 99
Toni Kroos
When I saw Kroos in the TOTS, I wasn't hopeful about how useful he would be, mainly due to the pace of his TOTY. However, with over 80 in both acceleration and sprint speed, he finally looks usable. I feel that his pace, along with being one of the lower rated La Liga TOTS Upgrades, should be enough to see him in the Ultimate XI. 
Predicted Rating: 95 → 98
N'golo Kanté
It should come as no surprise that the Frenchman will make it into the Ultimate XI, after yet another incredible title winning season. As one of the most complete midfielders in the game, he is a firm favourite of many players, and an upgrade will just make him even better. If you are lucky enough to be able to afford him, you will own what will be one of the best cards in the game.
Predicted Rating: 96 → 99
Emil Forsberg
From personal experience, the Swedish international seems to be one of the most used upgraded TOTS players, with Bundesliga teams remaining fairly popular due to the likes of Neuer and Aubameyang. This has resulted in Forsberg being a well-used player, and one who has been upgraded many times. As a Dortmund fan, I still have a slight hope that Dembélé will sneak in, but the Swede seems to have the edge over him as he only needed one Upgrade token rather than two. 
Predicted Rating: 94 → 97
Radja Nainggolan
What. An. Item.
The first player to have 90+ on each of his 6 ‘face-card' stats on both FIFA Mobile and the console version of the game, there is little doubt that he has been a favourite player to be upgraded and should easily make it into the Ultimate XI. 
Predicted Rating: 96 → 98
Dries Mertens
Many games have a ‘Legendary’ item in them, either deliberately or completely accidentally. Mertens falls into that second category after his incredible Impact, and then MOTM cards, which terrorised defences for months on end. This has all led to him becoming a firm favourite of many players, making him a guarantee for the Ultimate XI as he will be one of the most popular upgrades.
Predicted Rating: 95 → 97
Robert Lewandowski
I have to admit, this spot is fairly wide open. Ronaldo could take it, but with his 99 TOTY and other high rated LW’s like Reus and RB Coutinho, I can't see him being extremely popular. Lewandowski has several higher rated cards, but his TOTS is by far the best he has, making him one of the top completed plans as people want to add a great striker to join Aubameyang up front.
Predicted Rating: 96 → 98

Some of you who are more observant may notice that these upgrades will only use 21 Upgrade tokens, rather than the 23 which are available. 
With these extra two tokens, EA may choose to make an extra 99-rated player instead of a 97. However, this is just a guess and what they do will be a mystery to us all until they release the final team."

VsA Season 1 has wrapped up with the fourth and final Season 1 Weekend Tournament, heralding the arrival of VsA Season 2. Fan favourites and console beasts light up the 60 VsA S2 players selected by EA, and in a move sure to be welcomed by the ‘F2P’ player base, VsA passes are now FIFA Point purchases. If you’re short on FP, you can of course buy more through in-app purchases, and then spend that FP on the pass. The format remains the same as S1, with a Free Path and a Premium Path, check out my Season 1 Guide if you need a recap. 98 Prime Maradona, the first 92 GK in Prime VsA Samir Handanović, and some FIFA Mobile Season 1 flashbacks are some of the headliners we’ll look at, plus some new additions to the FIFA Mobile database, but first, what to do with your VsA S1 players?
VsA S1 Players
Four SBCs are available that will let you trade in your VsA S1 WT team for coins, SBs, and coins. If these don’t suit you, you can always use them to train your normal line up, your VsA S2 players for WT, or for Icon SBCs. If you’ve already used your VsA S1 players, you can buy more from the market, however they could get expensive if others have similar ideas! You'll find these under the 'Rewards' tab for VsA past the 'Top 250' tab. These SBCs have active Skill Boosts, so use golds in the right position to make them easier! The SBCs will be around for a week only, so don't forget to complete them.
The 1st SBC requires 5 VsA S1 players with a minimum 79 OVR for 100 SBs, 20k XP, and 50k coins. A step up for the 2nd SBC is 81 OVR and 7 VsA S1 players for 250 SBs, 100k XP and 250k coins. The 3rd SBC continues the trend, 83 OVR with 9 VsA S1 players for 350 SBs, 200k XP, and 500k coins. The 4th SBC offers the most rewards for an 85 OVR, 11 VsA S1 players squad. 500 SBs, 300k XP and 1 million coins. There are Icon Intro SBCs that offer twice the coins, and similar amounts of XP for lower OVR squads, however, so unless you're looking for SBs, consider selling your players or using them for Icon SBCs.
The Players
At the end of the VsA S1 Premium Path was Prime Icon Ruud Gullit, an expensive pursuit requiring over twice the amount of VsA points one could get without buying packs. For VsA S2, the final reward is legendary Argentine, Prime Icon Diego Maradona as a 98 CAM.
Throughout VsA S1 WT, Prime VsA players featured heavily, and you should expect them to again this season. A long term injury to Benjamin Mendy has forced Pep Guardiola to field Fabian Delph and Oleksandr Zinchenko at LB for Manchester City, and Zinchenko picks up his first special item in FIFA Mobile Season 2 with a Prime VsA 87 LB available along the Free Path in Word Class. Celta’s Emre Mor's high pace and dribbling will be very useful down the left flank -- or OOP -- as an 86 LW on the Premium Path in World Class. Athletic Bilbao’s Spanish speedster Iñaki Williams has terrifying a position change to an 88 ST, thankfully for your defence, he is on the Premium Path and will require the Legendary Pass to obtain. 
Also on the Premium Path in Legendary is fellow Spaniard Suso as a 90 RW. Not the fastest of players, his dribbling and passing abilities could make him a key playmaker for creating chances for Williams to finish. On the Free Path in Legendary is Schalke 04’s homegrown Max Meyer, a useful 89 CM for your WT teams. His defensive abilities are not the greatest, however, so consider partnering him with a more defensive player. 
The highest OVR Free Path player is Borussia Dortmund midfielder Mario Götze who showcases a 91 CAM that has hallmarks in his FIFA Mobile S1 Global Cup item. Götze is obtainable without any spending, but you’ll need to be in FIFA Champion to earn him, something less than 3,000 players obtained last season. 
Finally, Inter Milan’s shotstopper Samir Handanović is the last of the Prime VsA S2 players. Handanović becomes the second highest rated GK in-game after Prime Edwin van der Sar, and provides a way to Rank Up 3 GKs besides Rank Transfers. He is a Premium Path player, and is in fact a Bonus reward which will require the purchasing of VsA packs if you want to obtain him.
Like VsA S1, 53 non-Prime VsA S2 players are available throughout the month. Roma’s Champions League hero Kostas Manolas and Bayer Leverkusen’s GK Bernd Leno feature as 85 OVRs, and at 84 OVR, right wingers Sadio Mané and Willian switch positions to LW and CAM respectively. 
Receiving a throwback to his FIFA Mobile S1 Out of Position item is Juventus’ Juan Cuadrado at RWB. His 82 item might persuade some to try out 5ATB for WT, be prepared for him to terrorise your defence once more. 
You can view the rest of the VsA S2 players over here on Futhead, Futhead’s Squad Builder is also available to help your preparations for the first S2 WT this weekend.
Rewards
The major difference between VsA S1 and S2 is the availability of Division Passes for FP. Whether that means you go all out and use up your stashed FP on all four passes (6100 FP total), or you opt to go for one specifically, have a look below at the rewards to decide what you want to go for:

If you make it to FIFA Champion, consider picking up the FC Pass, 3500 FP for 500 SB (normally 10k FP in the Store) is a potential bargain. 
Except for some minor changes to rewards on the Free Path in Pro (35k more coins, 5k less VsA XP), and the new S2 Prime VsA Players, the reward totals for S2 are the same as those for S1.
VsA S2 Summary
It should be second nature now to play your 5 Daily VsA matches (with one win), no more EAster grinding should make this less tedious. Lots of variety in the VsA S2 player pool should make for some interesting WT teams, and the availability of fan favourites should increase the favoured formations. The end of season rewards were surprisingly generous -- 4 million coins, 1 million XP and an 87+ Elite in FIFA Champion -- however the lack of Skill Boost rewards is slightly disappointing. The VsA S1 trade-ins do offer some SBs, along with some other useful rewards, however Icon SBCs may be more worthwhile.
New Transfers
Futhead's database has received an influx of players as EA have added the latest batch of transfers to FIFA Mobile. Among them are Barcelona's new Colombian CB Yerry Mina, former FIFA console Legend Landon Donovan now plying his trade at Club Léon, and Argentine journeyman Carlos Tévez, who returns to Boca Juniors from China. Check out the rest of the transfers here under Latest Players."

We're a month and change into FIFA 18 Marquee Matchup SBCs. We've seen our fair share of ups and downs, surprises and expected picks as well. As we're getting into a good groove here at this point in the lifecycle, let's take a look at some possible matchups we'll see when these Squad Buildling Challenges are released next Tuesday, November 21.
Top Picks
As only four matchups tend to make the SBC, here are the four that we think are most probable to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and far from guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk
AS Monaco vs PSG
Match Info:  Ligue 1 didn’t feature this past week, so they’re a decent bet to be selected in the next SBC. There’s another compelling game between Nice & OM, yet a matchup of the title contenders and front runners would be hard to ignore. Get on those non-rares for potentially plumb profits.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 3 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Dortmund vs Schalke
Match Info: It’s always difficult to ignore the Bundesliga, so I won’t. The Revierderby offers a great derby for EA to select. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 79 rated


Player Requirement: 2 to 3 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Liverpool vs. Chelsea
Match Info: Another week, another important Premier League matchup. Two of the more attacking minded teams in the PL should make for a thrilling fixture. Although EA just selected a PL match, it wouldn't hurt to get your investments ready for this one (always useful for POTM as well).
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 79 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Spartak Moscow vs Zenit  
Match Info: In a week that is lacking some traditional derbies, these Russian teams provide a rivalry of the two capitals. Another fixture for solid non-rare investments means this game could be a nice low-risk/high-reward match.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall 


Player Requirement: 2 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there's pretty much never four mortal locks to make Marquee Matchups, let's take a look at some more fringe picks that could make their way in:
Cracovia vs Lechia Gdansk 
Match Info: In a matchup between the “Great Triad” vs ""Three Kings of Big Cities” (what a name, no?), these two Polish sides provide an interesting investment option. Correct me, but I do not think EA has chosen a Polish matchup yet, so look for them to potentially break that cycle.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 75 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Valencia vs Barcelona
Match Info: La Liga Santander currently features this week, but a matchup between the current top teams in the league could warrant EA’s inclusion. With some solid non-rare investment options from both sides, this matchup could be a potential cash cow.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 79 overall 


Player Requirement: 2 player from each team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry 


MLS Playoffs (Toronto vs Columbus or Houston vs Seattle)
Match Info: With the MLS playoffs in full swing, EA could choose one of the two Semifinals to appear. There are always a plethora of cheap MLS investments, so select wisely and you could see a solid return.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


European Fixtures 
*Important Note: Last year we saw EA release special Marquee Matchups for Champions and Europa League, and even though they have not done one yet it is always a good thing to keep on your mind. Even if the European matches are excluded this week, the players should see a spike in their value during the last match week in early December.
Investing Strategies
Let's review these basic tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team on how to possible make a few coins with potential Marquee Matchups:
-- Prioritize investing in players who are members of the two teams featuring in a specific Marquee Matchup (higher rated the better)
-- Non-Rare cards usually have a higher return on investment
-- Certain positions such as LB/RB, CMs and STs are generally more profitable 
It is important to have the three preceding principles in mind. However, depending on the caliber of the matchup, other techniques can be employed with less risk and greater rewards. Here are some examples:
High Popularity & High Required Rating
These matchup feature teams from leagues with massive global appeal and team overall requirements in and around the 80 mark. EA usually stick to leagues like the Premier Leageu and La Liga for these caliber of matchups. Our recommendation for this tier, is to invest in niche players from the featured teams, or in the highest rated non-rares from around the league. Stay away from the rare cards when possible.  

High Popularity & Low Required Rating
A fixture where the game is between two teams in a major league; however, the overall requirement is no higher than 78. For this category, investing in players rated 82 of higher is not recommended, since the best bang for your buck will be picking up non-rares that follow Tip 3.

Low Popularity & High Required Rating
A lot of matchups end up in this category. Teams/nations that feature a lot of gold options but lack global appeal. Typically, a matchup in this category tends to have the highest reward possibility when it comes to investing. 

Low Popularity & Low Required Rating
Embodied by some of the deep sleepers, these matchups feature teams from less desirable leagues, such as the lower divisions of England or the Hyundai-A league. Here, most players are silver or bronze. That being said, there is a high profit ceiling in these markets with relatively low risk. Our main tip is to pick up the highest rated card from either team, or the highest rated non-rares from the league."

First and foremost, Happy Thanksgiving to those of our readers in the United States! Tomorrow's one of the best times of the year to spend with friends and family. May your blessings and thanks be plentiful.
For the rest of us ... Happy Wednesday. Our reward for seeing through another day at the office/classroom? Team of the Week 10. And much like the feasts prepared for America's number one family holiday, the servings are plentiful.
Amongst a sea of big names, Path To Glory's Javier Pastore getting the first post-program ratings bump is eye catching to those who invested in or packed his neon player item. The big names are plentiful though, as mentioned: the likes of Radja Nainggolan, SIF Mauro Icardi (87 OVR!), another IF for Shkodran Mustafi as well, Paul Pogba, and of course, CAM Eden Hazard.
You know the TOTW means business when the likes of Lorenzo Insigne is one of the ""lesser"" players.

FIFA 18's fourth significant update's been released to PC. What this usually means is we can expect Microsoft and Sony to approve the submitted update sometime in the next week or so for Xbox One and PS4 respectively. If you don't see a specific bug, glitch, or feature you think absolutely needed to be tackled -- don't panic. EA's almost assuredly aware of it, and their new continuous patch release cycle likely means it just wasn't addressed in time to be included in this current patch.
Let's take a look at what Title Update 4 will be bringing to the next generation consoles soon. We've emphasized a couple of bullets worth being mindful/aware of:

The latest title update for FIFA 18 is now available.
This update includes the following changes:
Addressed the following issues in Gameplay:
- Incorrect penalty calls where a defender legally wins a header but also collides with an attacking player.
- Goalkeepers staying on the ground too long, not attempting to gather the ball, when the ball was within reach after a save.
- Goalkeepers sometimes not going for the ball after a back pass.
  - This issue would occur more often if using manual passing.

Addressed the following issues in FIFA Ultimate team:
- Players getting a message that there are no attempts remaining in the current Daily Knockout Tournament when their final attempt is still active.
- The game freezing when quickly selecting an opponent in Squad Battles immediately after getting to the Opponent Selection screen.
- Corrected some of the text for the squad requirements in FUT Champions.
- A visual issue with an incorrect overall player rating showing in the Player Performance screen of the Pause Menu in certain situations.

-Added additional matchmaking regions in Pro Clubs.
Addressed the following issues in Online Modes:
- Players being unable to make quick subs if they had used all their available pauses.
- The trophy not being presented in the Pro Clubs Championship celebration.
- Captains disconnecting from Pro Clubs matches when Voice Chat is disabled via game launcher.

Addressed the following issues in Career Mode:
- Players signed to pre-contracts, in the first season, not coming to your team if the first summer transfer window was disabled during your Career Mode setup.
- Some player attributes were missing from the Squad HUB.

-The tournament tree in the Women's International Cup being empty after the semifinals.
Addressed the following issues in Audio / Visual / Presentation:
- Repetitive whistling that was heard in some stadiums.
- Some visual issues with the Bundesliga broadcast package.
- Updates to a number of crests and kits.

Thanks to those who've provided feedback. Throughout the course of the FIFA 18 season we'll provide you with more information and updates if and when they come available.
The FIFA Team

Nothing dramatic, but as mentioned, some of the bigger fish to fry are likely still in the works. We should see more FIFA patches this FIFA than any other release (whether you like or dislike a current patch). We'll have to see what the future has in store."

With the rest of the football world putting their feet up over the festive period, TOTW 16 is a very England heavy selection because instead of resting them, we choose to run our national players in to the ground during a World Cup year in the name of ‘tradition’. But what that does mean is that there are some banging IFs from the Premier League, and a list of Unpredictables who were just that. 
Nicolas Nkoulou – CB – Torino
And the first tough prediction this week comes from Torino and Genoa’s 0-0 draw in Serie A where as you can imagine inform options for attackers were in short supply. So, it all came down to the defence in this one where Nicolas Nkoulou put in a commanding display which included five aerial clearances and a 100% tackle success rate. Okay, so he only made one tackle, but it was a damn good one.
Aaron's View: I mentioned that Calcio A was likely to get a random addition or two and here we have Nkoulou.
Leander Dendoncker – CB – Anderlecht
Anderlecht are a whopping 13 points off the top of the Belgian Jupiler League with rivals Club Brugge leading the charge. So it’s safe to say that Anderlecht aren't having the best of seasons but they did beat Gent 1-0 over the Christmas period where Sofiane Hanni found the net. The IF however goes to Leander Dendoncker who played out of position at centre half to help keep his side a clean sheet. Perhaps that’s why he’s taken the IF this week, but with a dearth of options, odd selections like this were always likely. 
Aaron's View: Being completely honest, I have no idea why Dendocker was even selected.
Jose Izquierdo – LM – Brighton
Brighton and Bournemouth played out an entertaining 2-2 on New Year's Day in the battle of the seaside towns with Bournemouth twice cancelling out strikes from Anthony Knockaert and Glenn Murray. Those two Brighton goals were both assisted by Jose Izquierdo from left wing, but the Columbian also put in a strong team performance with 5 tackles and 2 interceptions rounding off a great all-round display. 
Aaron's View: I already had a lot of PL selections this week so adding more was hard to justify.
Martin Braithwaite – LM – Middlesbrough
In a very rare Unpredictables occurrence, we must go back three separate Middlesbrough matches to find out why Martin Braithwaite makes TOTW 16. Where all the way back on 26 December he scored one and assisted another in Boro’s 2-0 win against Bolton. Boro have since lost to Aston Villa 1-0 and beaten Preston 3-2 in a packed Christmas schedule. Braithwaite's team mate Daniel Ayala is entitled to be a bit upset with this one...
Aaron's View: I opted for a different Middlesbrough player in Ayala who scored two from defence and I still feel as though he was the better option overall.
Danny Wilson – CB – Rangers
After back-to-back losses Rangers form improved somewhat over Christmas with a decent point earned in the Old Firm derby where Danny Wilson himself helped to preserver his sides clean sheet. And in the game prior Wilson popped with a goal and an assist in Rangers 2-0 win against Motherwell. One goal, one assist, and two clean sheets over two matches means Wilson walks in to TOTW 16, or any other game week for that matter. 
Aaron's View: Rangers drew 0-0 with Celtic which was always likely to result in an IF but who was a very difficult question. It looks as though the goal Wilson scored mid week has helped him.
Adrian Mierzejewski – RW – Sydney FC
Sydney FC smashed Perth Glory 6-0 over the festive break in a game which was always likely to bring IF opportunities. And it’s Adrian Mierzejewski who gets the nod for a goal and an assist in this game, but this IF is also a reward for his impressive form this season which has resulted in seven goals in nine games. 
Aaron's View: Another hat trick for Bobo but with him being unable to pick up consecutive IFs it looks as though they have opted for the next best thing. Normally I wouldn’t expect him to get in.
Jack Marriott – ST – Peterborough United
Another IF where we need to go back in time to find the source of Jack Marriott’s inclusion, and it comes courtesy of his brace and assist haul in Peterborough’s 3-1 win against Bradford. The rest of the festive period wasn’t quite so kind to The Posh who then lost at MK Dons and drew at Doncaster. Peterborough sit comfortably 8th in League 1.
Aaron's View: You have to go all the way back to Tuesday to find Marriott’s brace but with two poor results for Peterborough following that win I felt as though there were far better options."

Fans of the Airtricity (and Irish football in general) will get a boost with one of the most appetizing attacking Irish players to feature in FUT in some time.
Former Cork City standout Sean Maguire -- now with the Championship's Preston North End -- was selected as the PFA Ireland Player of the Year at their annual post-season awards Saturday. He edged out Dundalk's Patrick McEleney and Derry City's Aaron McEneff for the honor.
As part of the major Irish football award, Maguire gets a purple-and-gold fairly OP item in-game in FIFA 18 Ultimate Team for a limited time. It can be obtained by completing a Squad Building Challenge. The requirements for the POTY SBC can be found here. They seem mostly reasonable on paper, requiring 3 Airtricity + Championship players and one Team of the Week in-form item.
Besides the 90-paced attacking player item (which in fairness does possess 70 composure), Maguire might be worth completing for non-Irish/Championship fans to use in future SBCs.
You can watch Maguire receive his honor below. In real life, Maguire's nursing a lingering hamstring injury (as evident by the crutches in the video) that's caused him to miss extended time for PNE and the Irish national team's World Cup qualifying playoff as well.

International week is a TOTW predictor's worst nightmare, and that applies doubly this time around with final World Cup qualifiers being played on pretty much every day of the week inter-spliced with big-name friendlies to boot. It was a genuine prediction minefield, but our Aaron Grimmer navigated it as well as could be expected, missing just 10 players from his TOTW 9 prediction. 
So what went wrong with those 10? Let's take a look:
Sadio Mane – RW – Liverpool/Senegal
Senegal secured their place in next summer’s World Cup with a fairly comfortable 4-1 win on aggregate against South Africa. Their 2-0 away win in the first leg really did shut this play-off down, but why Mane? No goals, only one assist, and yet here he is rocking a purple Hero item? He’s Senegal's best and most iconic player, sure, but based on actual performance, he shouldn’t be anywhere near this TOTW. 
Aaron's View: I opted for Mane's teammate, Sakho, who scored the goal to gain Senegal's qualification. Alas, it was not to be, and we instead have the better item of the two in Mane who assisted said goal.
Corentin Tolisso – CDM – Bayern Munich/France
France had a pretty good International break too by all accounts, seeing off Wales comfortably, 2-0, before some Anthony Martial magic helped them to a 2-2 draw against Germany. But yet again I ask the same question: why Tolisso? One assist and a couple of good performances seem to be his entry criteria, which is fine, but lots of players play “well” every week. Oh wait, he has an OTW… 
Aaron's View: *Yet another midfielder with just one assist to his name in Tolisso. It was always going to be a rough week for predictions, but these ones are pushing it in my eyes. *
Artur Boruc – GK – Bournemouth/Poland
Poland are already qualified for the World Cup so instead played out a fairly drab 0-0 draw against Uruguay, followed by a 1-0 loss to Mexico. During the week however, Artur Boruc played his last game for Poland following his retirement (aww). So that’s why he’s in TOTW 9. That’s it. I mean, I get it, but why not give him a Hero card? Very strange considering the award of this is nothing to do with form.

Aaron's View: Boruc only played the first half in Poland's 0-0 against Uruguay and didn't do a whole lot during that time. It was his final game for Poland, but under that logic, shouldn't we be seeing a Buffon?
Granqvist – CB – FC Krasnodar/Sweden
Sweden were the big winners this week seeing off a very disappointing Italian side to make the World Cup with two clean sheets the bedrock of their success. Because of that, all members of their defensive unit were bound to be in contention for TOTW 9 and Andreas Granqvist is EA’s choice for a show of incredible aerial dominance. And it’s the first IF I’m not annoyed about this week, too. 
Aaron's View: I already had two Swedish players in my prediction. Olsen made it, however; Johansson was snubbed for Granqvist who was solid at the back during both matches against Italy. Hard to predict once again.
Manuel Fernandes – CM – Lokomotiv Moscow/Portugal
Portugal were in friendly action this week and Manuel Fernandes was back amongst the squad after a preiod of absence for the games against Saudi Arabia and the USA. And he did well, scoring the opener in Portugal’s 3-0 against Saudi Arabia and was generally great in both games. Which is more than enough based on this week's bar. 
Aaron's View: Portugal recorded a comfortable 3-0 win over Saudi Arabia which saw a brilliant team performance from them. Picking a sole player from the match was difficult for me to do and that's why Fernandes was missed.
Ljajic – CM – Torino/Serbia
Serbia headed off to the Far East for their two International friendlies and Adem Ljajic grabbed the limelight with the opener in their 2-0 win against China, and then another goal in their 1-1 draw with South Korea a few days later. Two goals for Ljajic and a very welcome position change to CAM which should open up lots of squad building opportunitites. 
Aaron's View: *I usually focus on each game separately when predicting which is why Llajic's one goal in each game didn't stand out all that much. With the lack of games available, taking both into consideration would have been a smart move in hindsight. *
Emanuele Calaio – ST – Parma
Unaffected by International week, Serie B went ahead as planned in Italy and Parma kept up their promising start to the season with a 2-1 win over Cittadella on Sunday. Calaio scored both goals in that win and that’s why he’s in TOTW 9. Simple. Can Parma get promoted yet again to return to Italy's top flight?
Aaron's View: With several Calcio B hat tricks being ignored towards the end of last season and the beginning of FIFA 18, I was questioning whether Calcio B were even able to pick up IFs. As it turns out, they can, and I will begin to consider them once more.
Brett Pitman – ST – Portsmouth
Also unaffected was Portsmouth’s League One game against Blackpool which ended in a thrilling 3-2 win for Pompey. Brett Pitman scored twice in this one, and boy did they need to grab those three points after losing their previous three matches in a row. Pitman now has 11 league goals this season and is a sure bet for goals at this level. 
Aaron's View: It was Pitman's fourth brace of the season already. There were several lower league strikers with two goals and not enough room for them all. From the ones missed, I believe Pitman was the most obvious.
Jorge Lozano – CB –  Tigres FC
Tigres FC put in a fine performance in Colombia this week to beat second place Atletico National at home 1-0 which made it back to back losses for the would be champions. Centre back Lozano was of course integral in the clean sheet but also scored the winning goal from the penalty spot in the 54th minute. Classic EA TOTW troll. 
Aaron's View: Another cheap IF now. Lozano did score the only goal of the game but it was from the spot and for me there were far better defensive options were out there this week.
Andrew Hoole – RM – Central Coast Mariners
The Central Coast Mariners went up against Sydney FC last Friday where they secured an impressive 2-0 win, in which Andrew Hoole scored one and assisted another to clinch the three points. This is by far the most obscure IF this weekly and oddly there's nothing from Australia’s national side who also picked up one of the final World Cup places.
Aaron's View: One goal, one assist in the A-League resulting in an IF? You don't normally see that again until the main leagues have finished."

Talking through his Esports UK Player of the Year award victory @Gorilla_Unilad is backstage at the #esportsia pic.twitter.com/PpQpjjx2QM— Esports Ind. Awards (@esportsIA) November 13, 2017

FIFA esports received a big boost in recognition Monday at the annual Esports Industry Awards, as the current FIFA Interactive World Cup champion and Ultimate Team stalwart Spencer 'Unilad Gorilla' Ealing was crowned the UK's Esports Player of the Year.
Ealing, who was crowned the best FIFA player in the world back in August, did not have the best start to his 2017 campaign. The Birmingham native was knocked out in the group stages of the first FIFA Ultimate Team Championship Series regional finals, held in Paris back in February. He roared back with a vengeance in the Madrid Regional in May, but was unable to overcome the final hurdle, placing second in the competition. In the FUT Champions Berlin Grand Final, he failed to even make the final. Ultimately though, Gorilla had the last laugh with his FIWC win in August.
""Last year, I was nominated for the Esports Player of the Year; unfortunately I didn't win it,"" said Ealing, after his win. ""I knew I was nominated for that award again this year, and also the UK Player of the Year. I thought I had a chance of winning, and I did, so it's a huge privilege and tops off a great year for me.""
Futhead and YouTube community influencer Chu 'Chu Boi' Morah was present at the event, as was Spencer 'Spencer FC' Owen:

Though he was the only FIFA esports player to come away with an award from the ceremonies, Ealing was not the only one nominated. Shaun 'Shellzz' Springette, whose remarkable run in the Berlin Grand Final shocked everybody, was up for Esports Rookie of the Year in the console category, but fell to Victor 'Punk' Woodley, an 18-year old American Street Fighter V player. Gorilla came up short to Matthew 'Formal' Piper, a Call of Duty esports pro (and former Halo standout), in the Esports Player of the Year category. ""FIFA 17"" was up for an Industry award, Esports Game of the Year, which it lost to ""Counter Strike: Global Offensive""."

When it comes to the thorny issue of loot boxes and prize boxes (or packs as we know them), FIFA Ultimate Team has never been far from the spotlight when the latest controversy hits the news. In the past, criticism from parents, players, consumer groups and even national newspapers have all highlighted issues with player protection, and the ability to spend real world money with seemingly reckless abandon on things like FIFA Points. 
But this last month, the loot box gaming landscape has shifted, perhaps forever. With EA’s ""Star Wars Battlefront II"" coming under industry wide attack for its use of loot boxes and ""Star Cards"" (which culminated in the most down-voted comment in Reddit history). Under that pressure, the BF II team have since backtracked and agreed to remove pay-loot boxes from Battlefront II until they can better balance the game's progression systems. They will, however, be returning at some point in the future. 
As well as that high-profile outrage, the UK government also became compelled to respond to a petition which highlighted the need for greater protection for vulnerable children and adults in relation to in-game gambling and loot boxes. Both of which as we know are on the rise with their presence found in nearly all AAA video games coming out both this year, and next. Similar cases have also been raised recently in Belgium and the Netherlands. 
So with loot boxes and in-game ""gambling"" at the height of controversy, and publishers across the land no doubt about to embark on a big change of strategy, it’s important for us as fans and commentators of all things FIFA to ask some difficult questions of our own. 
Firstly, the big one: is FIFA Ultimate Team itself aspirationally play to win, pay to win, or somewhere in between? And why is the perception of FIFA’s randomised packs, any different to those found in Star Wars Battlefront II?
Now I know most people will leap to answer the first question with some variation of “pay to win”, which to a degree I understand. But held up against Star Wars Battlefront II’s model, I think that snap reaction does somewhat of a disservice to the FIFA developers, who in the last few years especially, have added more ways to earn coins and packs through simply playing the game than we’ve ever had in FIFA before.

FUT Draft started the trend, offering coin rewards and packs for winning multiple matches on the spin. This year, the all-new Squad Battles have given even offline players perhaps their best ever chance at earning rewards. Then there are SBCs and of course FUT Champions for those good enough to duke it out online for the very best rewards FUT has to offer. So in terms of options and diversity, FUT is at a really good place right now in terms of balancing the incentivisation for us to play, instead of just pay. 
I think it’s also important to look at the history of FUT in this debate because the difference in the strength of reaction to the loot boxes in Battlefront II (compared to FIFA) is one of longevity. Whether you agree with the model or not, packs have been in FUT since day one, going all the way back to FIFA 09. Opening those little bundles of random terror/delight is very much part of the fabric of FUT to the point where the game couldn’t function without them. It’s not like EA suddenly dropped loot boxes in to FIFA 18. They’ve always been there and as such are a much more accepted part of the game for FIFA’s broader and more casual audience.
The big differentiator for FIFA as well is the Transfer Market, which allows players to spend the coins they’ve earnt directly on the players and items they want, rather than relying on the randomness of packs entirely for rewards. That system also allows FIFA players to make profit from trading and becomes yet another outlet for people to use their skill and knowledge of football to make coins instead of dipping in to their wallets. 
However, that doesn’t make concerns from parents, journalists, players and governing bodies any less legitimate, particularly for FIFA whose age rating is just PEGI 3 in Europe. Because whilst great strides have been made to improve game mode diversity, FUT is still very much built around a culture of buying packs, be it with in-game currency, or real currency. And these packs are in every sense of the word, random. For your £79.99 (12,000 FIFA Points) there’s absolutely no guarantee that you’ll receive anything even close to returning on that investment.
Much of the high-profile media coverage on in-game gambling centres on children who are of course more vulnerable, and often unaware of their spending. But it’s adults that are of greater concern to me when it comes to FIFA. Because even though they are well aware of what they are doing, they are the ones with access to greater pools of wealth be it credit, or earnt. And they are equally susceptible (if not more so) to the addictive rhythm of opening packs. A recent BBC survey found that 61% of 18-24-year-old football fans choose to engage with the sport via video games. Which on one hand for EA represents a huge market opportunity, but also a huge responsibility over duty of care. 
And it’s the duty of care space where I think EA can do more to protect and inform consumers both young and old when engaging with digital content in FIFA. The mystique over pack weights is one area of regular criticism and if there’s one thing government legislation will impact it’s this. We’ve already seen games published in China require their algorithms or “chance” rates for loot boxes to be openly published and I can see that happening in the UK too. When you gamble online on the National Lottery website for example, each Instant Play game tells you the average ""win"" percentage. So why not the same in something like FIFA? 
As a publisher and responsible company, the Star Wars Battlefront II debacle for me is actually an huge opportunity for EA to lead the gaming industry through this turbulence, rather than simply reacting whenever the latest internet lynch mob arrives at their door. If they can be proactive around micro-transactions, perhaps by removing the mystique around their algorithms, or maybe governing/limiting how many FIFA Points players can actually buy when they're exceeding usual spending habits, I think they could, in a meaningful way, shift the negative perception currently hanging over the company. And if EA don’t, another big publisher will.
Now would EA really cap their own profit by potentially limiting FIFA Point sales? I think that’s the most interesting part of this debate to be honest because then this becomes less about whether it's technically possible (it is), to how high EA see their duty of care for gamers on the priority scale? Now it’s easy for me to sit here and say “duty of care should trump all”, but for EA it would be a massive statement from a company of their size and status, but also potentially a way out of this mess. 
Whether FIFA itself has a “good” or diverse micro-transaction model or not, this whole event has sent shockwaves around the industry and it will potentially force the FIFA developers to look closely at their own framework and whether they’re doing enough to keep FIFA on the right side of this debate. Increasing game diversity further will help and I’m sure that’s already on the agenda for FIFA 19, but it’s the bigger, braver steps I’ve outlined could really define what will likely be an industry wide generation 2.0 of loot boxes in video games. 

FIFA Ultimate Team has one of the most commercially successful micro-transaction models in gaming history, grossing over $1 billion a year in digital revenue. It is an absolute monster of a success story for EA and I’m sure it will continue to be exactly that. However, due to recent developments EA, FIFA and the industry as a whole are at a cross-roads. And the direction EA choose to take with FIFA and other titles, I hope is one of leading, rather than being led."

FIFA 17's last but not least Team of the Season squad is here.
As first prematurely leaked in a social media promotional video from EA SPORTS Turkey, the ""Rest of the World"" side showcases players from domestic leagues on their own perhaps not worth an entire league-wide release. It's historically been the final traditional-TOTS-release-cycle group of new players until the MLS All-Star team in early August.
ROTW TOTS staple Croatian fullback Darijo Srna returns with another overpowered item, arguably the most noteworthy of any in the set. FC Shakhtar Donetsk teammate Taison Barcellos Freda (aka ""Taison"") has some spicy face card ratings, but with a three-star weak foot out of position from his base card at left midfielder, likely will leave some to be desired.
A few other Team of the Week semi-regulars from over the last several FUTs including Swedish striker (by way of the Greek League) Marcus Berg and Chilean point person Esteban Pardes feature, along with a blue re-release of Ekstraklasa Player of the Year, Belgian beast Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe.
Finally, Danish footballer Mike Jensen may have limited viable chemistry possibilities, but his previous Player of the Year SBC this past fall was essentially a Renato Sanches inform. If you've got TOTS Christian Eriksen or are simply looking for a super sub, he could well be worth the shout.
Here's the full FUT 17 Rest of the World Team of the Season:

You wanted more Prime Icons in packs and obtainable through Squad Buildling Challenges; you've got them.
For a third straight Thursday, EA's FIFA 18 live team has released a trio more of new Prime Icons, this time Dutch central defender Frank Rijkaard, Swedish striker Henrik Larsson, and surely the most coveted this cycle, OP-looking French CB Marcel Desailly.
Rijkaard isn't potentially at the position some would've preferred, but at CDM with the metrics that he has, could be the move (and perhaps at a not too unreasonable price point). Larsson probably isn't a player many who aren't Celtic, Barcelona, or hardcore Swedish football fans will be coveting, but it's nice he finally has an item more in line with what he brough to the pitch (appropriately enough) in his prime. And of course Desailly isn't going to come cheap, but you can expect to see him in some pros' sides without fail post haste.
All 3 Icons have 20-game loan versions available for a limited time and their untradeable SBCs and packable tradeable versions are here for the rest of FUT 18."

It feels good to accurate project all the fixtures featured in the current Marquee Matchups, and hopefully you were able to make a pretty penny. All matches picked were fairly high profile, so maybe that will lead EA to include some more ancillary fixtures next time. But without further ado, let's make some predictions for next week:
Top Picks
As only four matchups tend to make the SBC, here are the four that we think are most probable to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and far from guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Porto vs Benfica
Match Info:  The “O Classico” highlights a week that has a surprising amount of derbies! If EA ignore such a high profile match from Portugal, they’ll definitely receive some flak. So invest accordingly.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 3 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Anderlecht vs S. Liege
Match Info: A historic rivalry kicks off the Pro League playoffs, so this match could be a solid shout for non-rare investments. The risk is relatively low with a high ceiling for profits. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 rated


Player Requirement: 2 to 3 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Juventus vs Napoli
Match Info: Serie A was left out of the last two Marquee Matchups, yet a fixture between two top teams should make EA reconsider. A big game for Juventus could yield big profits for you.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 79 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Besiktas vs Galatasaray
Match Info:  It’s not often that the Turkish league has big derbies; however, when they do they usually feature. Make sure to consider the non-rare cards in for the lowest risk and most reward.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall 


Player Requirement: 2 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there's pretty much never four mortal locks to make Marquee Matchups, let's take a look at some more fringe picks that could make their way in:
Bournemouth vs. Southampton 
Match Info: It's always tough for EA to ignore the PL, so to do my due dilligence, I included one of the more compelling fixtures, the ""New Forest derby"".
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


 FC Thun vs Young Boys
Match Info: We head to Switzerland, where the ""Bernese Derby"" can provide some diversity to the weeks SBC. If it features, the silvers players should yield a hefty profit. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 79 overall 


Player Requirement: 2 player from each team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry 


Birmingham vs Wolves
Match Info: With the PL getting a lot of love lately, EA may turn to the lower divisions for another English rivalry, the ""West Midland Derby"". Investing in high rated non-rare silvers might be your best bet here.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Montpellier vs Marseille
Match Info: Even though Ligue 1 features this week, you have to consider it a possibility. This match, or Lille vs Lyon (Nov 29), look like good hedges.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Investing Strategies
Let's again review these basic tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team on how to possible make a few coins with potential Marquee Matchups:
-- Prioritize investing in players who are members of the two teams featuring in a specific Marquee Matchup (higher rated the better)
-- Non-Rare cards usually have a higher return on investment
-- Certain positions such as LB/RB, CMs and STs are generally more profitable"

48 new players are hidden throughout FIFA Mobile’s latest promotion, as EAster returns to the small screen. 4 eggs in 4 colours -- this year in red, blue, yellow, and white -- each featuring 2 Master Easter players alongside 10 other Easter players in a huge selection that should cater for most, if not all, players’ teams. More SBs, XP, and a much needed coin injection are standards for promotions, and there’s baskets full of rewards during EAster. Get ready to hunt in yet another exciting promotion from the FIFA Mobile team … is that a Golden Ticket I spy?
The Players
Similar to St. Patrick’s Day, EAster players are all based on the colour of their kit, which paves the way for the White Easter Masters, Real Madrid’s Spanish maestro Isco and Bayern Munich’s away kit garbed Austrian David Alaba. Featuring for the Blue Easter Masters are Chelsea’s German colossus, Antonio Rüdiger rocks an impressive 93 CB item and fellow German Leon Goretzka in Schalke 04’s traditional blue. Red isn’t short on star power, with two console favourites in Italian Alessandro Florenzi sporting AS Roma’s home kit and French master of sweat Anthony Martial looking sharp in Manchester United red. Not to forget the Yellow Easter Masters either, Spaniard Samu Castillejo leads the Yellow Submarine of Villarreal with a 91 RM item, and PSG’s homegrown Frenchman Adrien Rabiot sports their bright yellow away kit as a 91 CDM. The Masters are all untradable, so those looking to stockpile 93s for RU4s will have to get lucky and pack one themselves.
The best of the rest include 88 items for Valencia’s Brazilian GK Neto in their ‘keeper’s blue kit, Portugal’s forgotten poster boy in Swansea’s Renato Sanches CM decked in white, AC Milan’s Turkish playmaker Hakan Çalhanoǧlu out on the LW in the Rossoneri’s iconic red and black stripes, and the popular yellow Dortmund RB, Pole Łukasz Piszczek in familiar yellow. 87s in SL Benfica’s Spanish LB Álex Grimaldo, fellow Spaniard Luis Alberto of Lazio as a CF, a pair of Argentines in Watford’s CM Roberto Pereyra and Montreal’s LW Ignacio Piatti, and Romanian GK Ciprian Tǎtǎruşanu of FC Nantes. See all the Easter players right here on Futhead, with a summary below:

The EAster Campaign - Main Chapter
After some experimenting with 4 hour, 6 hour, and 12 hour cycles, it looks like EA have settled on 8 hour cycles, which are key in this 10 day long event. In the Main EAster chapter, 4 Skill Games and 4 VSA matches await thrice a day. The 4 Skill Games alternate between offering the five Skill Boosts from the four newest Skill Boosts and a guaranteed Easter Egg, as do the VSA matches. Say the first Skill Game offers 5 Skill Boosts, then the second would offer a specific Easter Egg, the third 5 SBs, and the fourth a different Easter Egg. Every 8 hours you can earn one guaranteed Easter Egg of each colour, plus 20 SBs guaranteed to be Captain, Composed, Counter, or Second Striker. This should come as a welcome move from the player base as a great way to catch up their lacking Skill Boosts to be more in-line with their other SBs.
We’ll break the Main Chapter down into two sections, Skill Games and VSA matches. As described above, Skill Games repeat every 8 hours, with all Skill Games being repeatable for 2 stamina and offering a chance at any coloured Easter Egg, a chance at a Rainbow Easter Egg -- more on them later -- or 1000 coins. The VSA matches are split amongst 4 nodes, and matchmaking only occurs on that node. That means that if you are on node 3, you won’t be matched with anyone playing normal VSA, or anyone on nodes 1, 2 or 4. The VSA Matches are not repeatable and do not affect your fans. 
The Hunt
Building on Lunar New Year’s Red Envelope chapter, the Hunt chapter utilises 32 randomly coloured eggs to hide 3 user-specific rewards. This time around, the 3 hidden rewards are randomised for every player, so if your league mate has a 92 Martial as a reward, your reward might not be a Red Easter player at all. One of the hidden rewards is guaranteed to be a player and could be either an 82+ Easter player of a specific colour, or even a specific Master player if you get lucky, remember that Master players are untradeable. The 82+ Easter player reward includes a chance at the Masters too, so there's a chance you could pack 93 Alaba from an 82+ White Easter player slot. Opening an Easter Egg requires one of that specific colour Eggs (earned through the Main Chapter or through packs) or a Rainbow Egg, and rewards 1000-30,000 coins plus a chance at one of the rewards. Like LNY, you could get all 3 prizes in your very first egg, or they could be in the very last 3. Adding incentive to saving Easter Eggs is the Golden Ticket. Every time you open all 32 Easter Eggs in an 8 hour cycle, you can earn an extra 500k coins, an Easter Logo and a Chance at a Golden Ticket. Only the first 12 Golden Tickets will be rewarded, but opening all 32 Easter Eggs is harder than it sounds. Golden Tickets can be redeemed on the account that obtained them for a 100 OVR version of any FIFA Mobile Season 2 player, who will receive updated card art, upgraded stats, and a new fancy bio. So if you wanted Prime Icon Lothar Matthäus, not only would he be upgraded immediately to 100 OVR, but his stats would receive a buff to beyond their already game-breaking abilities. Golden Ticket players are subject to Terms and Conditions, which can be read in game on the far right of the Hunt chapter.
Packs
Five 500k coin packs and unlimited 1000 FP packs are available throughout EAster, each offering 2 EAster items -- including Easter Eggs, Players, 1-5 guaranteed Easter Eggs,  and 10k Generic XP. A 10k FP bundle offers an Easter Kit, a guaranteed 82+ EAster player, and two Rainbow Eggs. There are also one-off in-app purchases for each colour egg if you happen to be just short in your quest for a Golden Ticket.
Guide
EAster is all about the Golden Tickets, earning the chance at one of 12 exclusive players. With 30 cycles over 10 days, you will be looking at at least 30 Easter Eggs of each colour. Finding the rewards is part of the fun, but ultimately you should be aiming for a rather boring opening of 32 Easter Eggs. You should have enough Easter Eggs to attempt a Golden Ticket at least 3 times, possible 4 if you’re lucky, without packs. Due to the random nature of the Hunt, you could have anywhere from 0 through 32 Red Easter Eggs at once, so I suggest waiting till you have at least 10 or so of each colour before attempting a Hunt. The randomness of the Hunt also affects your rewards, so you will have to weigh up whether you want a chance at a Golden Ticket straight away (remember, only the first 12 can be redeemed), or you want to wait out for better rewards. Say your rewards are 50 SBs, 25k Goalkeeper XP and an 82+ player, you may be better off waiting for the next cycle when you could get, say 500k coins, 25k Attacker XP and 93 Isco. With Weekend Tournament, your 5 Daily VSA matches, and a new round of SBCs, this weekend looks jam packed with things to do, so maybe save your grinding for after the weekend is over.
Collecting a Starting XI of all Easter players will reward you with the Easter Trophy, if you are looking to build on your trophy collection.
Summary
48 new players featuring some tantalising card art, plus the chance of being an exclusive Golden Ticket winner makes EAster a must for anyone seeking to advance their team.  Your choice of which rewards to go after is very welcome, and although there are 40 more tradable elites, they should be spread out enough that they don’t cause an oversupply on the market. 8 hour cycles are very welcome, although 17 VSA matches a day (plus WT) could start to get tedious.
TL;DR for you Reddit folks

48 new players in four colours
Two 91-93 Easter Masters per colour -- untradeable
10 tradeable 82-88 Easter players per colour
8 hour cycles, with 4 Skill Games and 4 VSA Matches

A pair of Manchester City teammates battled for top honors, but only one could take it. 
After a stunning 3 goals, 3 assists, 6 key passes, and 7 dribbles, including an average WhoScored.com match rating of 8.46 for the month of October, Manchester City's Leroy Sané is your EA SPORTS Premier League Player of the Month. For his troubles, as we've grown accustomed to the last two FIFAs, he's being honored with a shiny purple-and-gold FIFA 18 special player item.
Both an untradeable reward Squad Buildling Challenge as well as a loan version of the player item are available now for the next several weeks.
Sane's choice is particularly interesting given that he was just graced with an 82 LM Path to Glory item during that promotion. Those were not expected to be upgraded by Player of the Month honors but could theoretically influence his next in-form, Man of the Match, or Team of the Group Stage item's ratings, which would bump the PTG one.
You can see what the Mane Player of the Month SBCs' requirements are in Futhead's Squad Buildling Challenges section."

Besides more of the the usual November burnout related griping (""momentum!"", ""scripting!"", ""skill gap!"", etc.), one of the more juicy storylines in FIFA 18 over the course of the past few weeks has been the emerging curiosity surrounding FIFA's most popular new game mode this year, Squad Battles.
PC's been ripe with ostensible cheaters/game manipulators, as has long been presumed the case in Seasons and the like, on their leaderboards. But only recently have the top score getters on the next generation consoles gotten more and more extreme totals points-wise.
FIFA YouTuber/streamer NepentheZ has taken to social media, both Twitter and /r/fifa, to present his theories on the matter. The gist of it is boils down to the top-rated Squad Battles player(s) on PS4 was believed to be using low-strength possessing bronze attacking players in a scheme to solicit the computer into getting multiple players sent off on red-card-worthy tackles from behind, and then coast to an easier three-man advantage win on Ultimate difficulty (and massive 3,000+ points per match scores in the process).
That hustle may be doomed. From the EA forums:

Hey FIFA Fans,
The latest title update for FIFA 18 is now available on XB1. The update will be available on PS4 and PC later today.
This update includes the following change, which was made because some players were using an unintended gameplay mechanic to beat the computer on higher difficulty levels in FUT Squad Battles:
Made the following change in Gameplay:
Removed the chance for the CPU AI controlled player to receive a second yellow card when trying to push or pull an opponent, with the exception of an attacker who is through on goal and 1 on 1 with the keeper.
-- This has no impact on human controlled players.
To better explain this change we wanted to provide some additional context around how the CPU team plays the game.
-- The CPU plays the game as you would, limited by the same input restrictions as a human player is.
-- This means that the CPU team has an active player, just like you do, which we call the CPU AI controlled player.

-- A CPU AI controlled player exists in the following circumstances:
-- On a team with no human players.
  --  For example, the CPU controlled team in Squad Battles.
-- On a team with human players who are all locked to specific players, that also has CPU teammates.
 --   For example, a Pro Clubs team, with less than 11 human players, with no ANY player.
A CPU AI controlled player does not exist in the following circumstances:
-- On a team with human players who are not locked to specific players.
   -- For example, a team in FUT Champions.
Thanks to those who’ve provided feedback. Throughout the course of the FIFA 18 season we'll provide you with more information and updates if and when they become available.
The FIFA Team

Squad Battles has been a revelation for many of us wanting premium rewards but without the time (or stress) commitment of the Weekend League. Because it's an offline mode, especially some place like PC where mods and exploits are far more trivial, it's challenging to imagine a cheat/glitch filled world however. 
Will today's patch get us closer, at least on PS4 and Xbox One and close this loophole once and for all? And how long will it take from some other intrepid bug-abuser to start glitching high scores again?
We'll all have to wait and see."

After a very disappointing week in terms of my predictions, we are now back on familiar ground with the domestic season back underway. And what better way to get started than with four top fixtures from across the globe to try and predict.

Roma v Lazio
We start off in Italy, where it’s a battle of 5th v 4th. Both teams are in fine form, with unbeaten campaigns in European competition, and with 11 wins out of their last 12 games combined (a hiccup of a 1-0 loss for Roma against Napoli), it has the potential to be a thrilling encounter.
Roma are currently 1 point behind their opponents, and rely more on a very tight defence than goalscoring prowess to get points. With the best defensive record in the league, keeping 7 clean sheets and conceding 7 in their 11 games so far this season. 
Lazio are the opposite, as they are all about outscoring their opponents. Their only loss this season was a 4-1 defeat to Napoli, but with 2 wins against Juventus and 1 against AC Milan already this season, they are in fine form and hoping to keep pace with the league leaders with another win.
This one is very difficult to call so a draw is certainly not off the cards, but based on how high scoring Lazio are, I can see them taking the win in this game, as Roma’s defensive lapses have been exposed recently by both Chelsea and Fiorentina while Lazio are both keeping teams out and scoring very well.
My prediction: Lazio win

Arsenal v Spurs
The North London derby is always a big occasion, and in recent years it has changed from red to white with Spurs becoming one of the best sides in Europe while Arsenal seem to have dropped into mediocrity in their terms. 
Spurs are now the outright dominant team in the rivalry, sitting 4 points ahead of their rivals and performing excellently both at home and in Europe with recent wins against Real Madrid and Liverpool. However, they have a few injury concerns ahead of the match, with Kane, Alli, Lloris, Wanyama and both Vertonghen and Alderweireld all suffering from some form of injury. Who recovers in time may have a big impact on how Spurs will perform, so it may be advisable to wait and see nearer the end of the Matchups even to check who is likely to play before you pick your team.
Arsenal may not be the force they once were, but they are still battling it out at the top end of the Premier League table, and have scored as many goals as their close rivals this season. And with no major injury problems except Mustafi, they should field a near full strength team for the match.
The last three matches between the two sides that have been played at the Emirates have ended as 1-1 draws which could be an omen for this game, but I can’t see Spurs failing to win this one.
My prediction: Spurs win

Atletico v Real
I doubt anyone would had predicted that both Real and Atletico Madrid would be 8 points off the pace after just 11 matches of the La Liga season but that is the reality in yet another crazy La Liga season. This may just be the perfect time for this game to come, with both teams needing a win to try and kick start their campaign and try and start clawing back some of the gap to Barcelona at the top of the table.
Real Madrid’s struggle in the Champions League has been widely documented, but they are also struggling domestically. Their joint top scorers this season are Isco and Asensio, who have just 4 goals each, while Bale, Ronaldo and Benzema only have that number combined. 
Atletico’s defensive record may still be intact, but they are seriously lacking goals from Griezmann, Gameiro and co. having scored just 16 goals in 11 games. Having drawn 9 of their 16 games in all competitions this season, many fans may be starting to think that the move away from the Vicente Calderon was a bad move.
With both teams struggling for goals, I can see this game ending in a stalemate, but it’s such a tough game to call that it could easily go either way.
My prediction: Draw

Monterrey v Tigres
The game I’m assuming most people will struggle with predicting and may need a bit more insight into is the big clash in the Mexican Apertura. With 1 game left in the season, hosts Monterrey sit 2 points clear of opponents Tigres at the top of the table so it’s a winner takes all encounter.
Monterrey only need to draw to clinch the title, and can boast the best defensive and second best attacking record in the league, behind only their opponents Tigres. But with a draw and a loss against two midtable sides in their last two games, they have failed to get the 2 points necessary so far, so will they fail again?
Tigres, who boast an attacking trio of Enner Valencia, Andre-Pierre Gignac and Eduardo Vargas, are certainly not shy in front of goal, with the trio boasting an incredible 18 goals and 8 assists between them. With 4 wins in their last 5, they are coming into the game in great form, and have a slight record in head-to-head encounters with Monterrey - with Tigres winning the previous 2 in a row on an aggregate score of 6-1.
My prediction: Tigres win

That concludes our third set of predictions. What do you think the result of each game will be? Getting all four correct will earn you a very nice 83 Overall CM Sergej Milinkovic-Savic from Lazio, so good luck to all you Serie A fans chasing him!"

FIFA 18's next big event is upon us. EA Sports have dropped ""Path to Glory,"" an event that introduces a brand new item type that's focused on the journey to the 2018 FIFA World Cup. These new items are aimed at the younger generation looking to make a name for themselves on the world's stage. Much like regular Ones to Watch cards, these items will have the chance of getting upgrades throughout the year based on real-life performance. 
Avid players of the Weekend League or Squad Battles will be excited to see fan-favorite Gabriel Jesus among the list of players available. Same goes for Marcus Rashford. If you're looking for a new striker for your club and a nice investment opportunity, these could be the perfect cards for you. 
Will your own Path to Glory involve some of these brand new cards? 
For more info on any questions you may have about these new item types, here's a helpful Q&A provided by EA: 

Q: What makes Path to Glory special?  
A: Path to Glory Contender items dynamically upgrade and can get ratings boosts throughout the season. If you have a Path to Glory Contender item in your club, its ratings will automatically match that of the player's latest Team of the Week, Man of the Match, European Team of the Tournament, Hero, or Record Breaker in-form items. The better the player performs in real life, the higher their ratings can go.
Q: What is a Live Item?  
A: Path to Glory players will be released as Live Items. The ratings on this item type update automatically, whether the item is in your Club or listed on the Transfer Market.
Q: When do Path to Glory Contender items get updated?  
A: The items get automatically updated when a new Team of the Week, Man of the Match, European Team of the Tournament, Hero, or Record Breaker promotion is released, provided that the player is included.
Q: What happens if a Path to Glory Player is transferred/loaned to a different club?  
A: The Path to Glory Player Item attributes and latest in-form rating will be unaffected. However, the player's Path to Glory item will remain at the player's previous club until he gets an applicable in-form item, at which point the player's club, crest, and dynamic image will be updated.
Q: What happens if a Path to Glory player changes nationality?  
A: The Path to Glory Player Item will be updated with the new nationality as soon as possible.
Q: What happens if a Path to Glory Player is transferred/loaned to a club not in FUT18?  
A: The Path to Glory Player Item will remain at the club he was previously at, but the player will not receive any further updates. His Path to Glory Item will continue to carry the last applicable in-form rating he received.
Q: What is the criteria for picking Path to Glory players?  
A: Path to Glory contains a selection of players that are contending for spots on their respective national teams.
Q: What happens if a Path to Glory Player's in-form is in a different position to their Path to Glory item?
A: The player's position on his Path to Glory item type will not change. He will continue to receive any attribute upgrades from that and future applicable in-forms

Market Overview
With some big promotions in the past, the FUT market has begun to climb out of its huge crash. Player prices have climbed across the board, and when EA extended their Upgrade & Base Icon SBCs it means these prices should hold stable, and even continue to climb. That being said, be weary of some big promotions on the horizon in April, and of course Team of the Season looming.   

Although a quiet week for the FUT market overall, Ones to Watch shined during the international break. Some quality performances saw a couple Team of the Week items, which we’ll touch on later, but also some really positive returns across the board. It was nice to see our analysis pay off, so continue reading to see how you can use the OTW sector to position yourself profitably in the coming weeks.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats



The graphs above are concise overviews of all the keypoints from the data that I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:   Nice to see some green returning to the weekly roundup, and in case of the high/low spread, make sure to note that most players prices are close to their “highs”. Yet, we like the looks of Nicolas Tagliafico, Joao Mario and Inigo Martinez as items who are pretty close to their discard values with solid hype potential.   

Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take:  Another week with quite large figures, we want to reiterate that volatility is good for the market. It presents an opportunity for investors and traders to get in low and sell high, so players like Federico Bernardeschi, Serge Aurier and Michy Batshuayi catch our eye here. Make sure to stay patient on those open bids, and look to the overnight period to flip!
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Just like volatility, this section sports some pretty high figures as the market continues to correct itself. Beta helps us grasp the possibility of price shifts, and big figures here tell us a player’s price isn't settled. Looking for positive returns, items like Nelson Semedo, Davinson Sanchez and Lucas Moura are your guys here.  

TOTW Shout
How about that Kyle Walker position change?!? Had to say it, and the Englishman delivered, but don’t forget about the Colombian magician James Rodriguez. Both cards look really solid, and should fall to quite reasonable price points. 
Something else of note this week, was the uncertainty around a few players getting an inform such as Kylian Mbappe, Virgil Van Dijk and Romelu Lukaku. These players put in quality performances, but according to EA since it was after Sunday they didn’t count towards this week’s TOTW. Just another reason to sell into the hype, and keep that in mind going forward.
In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner - Kyle Walker (Manchester City)
A 91 pace Centre back highlighted TOTW28, but make sure to remember Kyle Walker’s OTW will remain at RB. Looking at his stats that might not be a bad thing at all, but make sure to keep that in mind when expecting where his price will fall. Overall though, a 140% weekly return lands Walker as this week’s biggest winner!
Just like the majority of OTW items included in the TOTW expect his price to decline, but that just means its best to plan on where he will settle. In terms of outlook, Man City are in a great position to win the EPL, and their form hasn’t dipped. The only downside to that is their attack seems to get all the attention.
That tendency to be overshadowed poses a huge risk for defender items, but lots of fixtures remaining gives us hope for Walker. If you want to invest, or just pick him up, make sure to research his price for a couple days, then be patient and pick one up on open bid. Once you have him though, make sure to sell whenever you can take profit!

Big Loser - Cenk Tosun (Everton)
Unlike previous weeks, choosing a player for this honour was difficult because of the lack of options. Sure, there were players in the red; however, nobody completely jumped out. So, we decided to shed some light on an item who lost big this week, but still has solid potential. Enter Cenk Tosun as this week’s biggest loser.
The Turkish forward is coming off a TOTW item that bumped his OTW to an 84, and just like most dynamic items who receive an upgrade their price declines the following week. This trend has persisted all year, so make sure you’re selling early to maximize profit, yet it's important to note this price decline presents an opportunity in Tosun’s case. 
With an 84 rated item below 20K you start to enter the low risk zone. Also, if Everton can put together a couple quality performances, Tosun already proved he has the ability to skyrocket in price. Make sure to watch this space. 

Recap & outlook
In general, the FUT market is continuing to climb out of the mega crash, and with no big promos for a few weeks it looks set to continue. The Ones to Watch sector had a much more eventful week over the international break, with two inform upgrades and a lot of positive weekly returns. This bodes well for the future, yet we still recommend sticking to low risk investments going forward. Planning ahead, make sure to be on the lookout for the Team of the Knockout Stage promo in mid/late April, and Team of the Season should always be on your mind. Some final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Market creeping back up, so get comfortable with a few items and flip overnight.     

-- OTW investors: Stick to the low risk investments considering most higher value players will drop drastically going forward after every fixture that doesn’t bring them an inform.

Lots of OTW items still in the Champions League, so who are you watching in the Quarterfinals? We’d love to hear your answer below, and also, if you can’t get enough market analysis check out our latest Path to Glory update.

Market Overview
The international break brought about another big week for the Ones to Watch (OTW) market. Two OTW items feature in the current Team of the Week (TOTW). However, looking at the data from the past week has allowed us to gain invaluable insight into the price trend of upgraded OTWs. And, when it comes to FUT investing/trading knowldge is power.
In the general FUT scene, EA finally released some quality Squad Building Challenge many players were looking for, and it seems to have stabilized players’ prices for now. This promo, Path to Glory, also came with a new batch of OTW-esque live cards. It will be interesting to see if their prices parallel the traditional Ones to Watch, but we’ll cover these cards later. Circling back to the stable prices, it raises the question if we’ve seen the worst of the crash, or if it’s just the calm before the storm?
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 enthusiasts have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take: Taking a look at the figure above, the highs and lows has captured the expected peak price of an upgraded OTW item. Specifically, looking at  Bertrand Traoré, one can see there are some big swings in prices over the week (similar trend in Kylian Mbappe Lottin & Mohamed Salah). So, sell into the hype, while investing in the subsequent drop could yield great profit.

Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take: Across the board, volatility has been pretty low this week. That reflects the stabilizing prices, yet in the players contending for an inform their volatility remained high. While volatility can be useful, the stable prices can also help traders know when they snagged a good deal.

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of a card to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Uncertainty still reigns about a Black Friday effect, so looking at Beta this week can really help an investor manage their risk. If you’re thinking the market is going to hold value, or increase, Serge Aurier, Federico Bernardeschi and Keita Balde Diao might be solid shouts. On the other hand, if you’re risk adverse Leonardo Bonucci and Franck Yannick Kessié have usually held their price. 
TOTW shout
Three players had decent shots at making the TOTW: Romelu Lukaku, Alexandre Lacazette and Corentin Tolisso . Two made it, and I’d say they are a couple fine items, so expect to see them in a Weekend League near you. 
In-depth daily analysis

For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner(s) -- Corentin Tolisso (Bayern Munich)
This spot could easily have gone to Lukaku who would’ve continued the tradition of Big Losers becoming Big Winners, but the ex-Lyon midfielder deserves it just as much. Tolisso picked up his upgrade after a couple compelling performance, rather than impressive stats, which is an ode to EA’s expect the unexpected. 
The preceding point meant not a lot of people invested in the card and that is apparent in his low volatility and narrow high/low range. Alas, there were still a few investors exemplified in his positive returns on the 12th and 13th. His high beta (0.80) also lends to the fact his card jumped to around 120k after the TOTW announcement. Taking a step back, Corentin’s weekly stats demonstrated the qualities of a good investment, stable price and solid game time, so look to his example for your next OTW bet. Although, always keep in mind it’s a gamble...          

Big Loser -- Keita Balde Diao (AS Monaco)
If you follow me on Twitter you’ll see that I have posted a few times that I think Keita was overpriced. I loved watching him in the Serie A and think he has a ton of potential, but paying anywhere above 60k for an 82 LW was suspect. 
Finally, this week Balde Diao took a big plunge in price and landed himself in the biggest loser spot. His price had remained stable over previous weeks; however, the -16.2% on the 10th really did him. My speculation on that massive of a drop was that someone hoarding him as an investment finally bit the bullet and listed their positions. Other than that, he had a noticeably high volatility (~3,000) for his price range, while also sporting a close to 2 beta signifying he was at risk to have a big price swing. 
A solid card (Pace & Skills) coupled with a good amount of hype does mean the Senegalese international could be a big winner in the future. Therefore, a more reasonably priced card could be a positive from this week. 
Path to Glory Picks
With World Cup spots on the line, EA took the opportunity to release a batch of “live” items that act basically like OTWs. For more detailed info about this promo click here, but otherwise I felt it appropriate to put in my two cents about some players to watch. Definitely have to thank our Darren8196 for helping put these together.
Gabriel Jesus -- in great form, just be cautious because of Man City's striker rotation. Pretty easy games til mid-December so may be a decent bet if you can handle the expensive price tag. 
Stephen El Sharaawy -- also in spectacular form for Roma with 3 goals in his last 3 games. A tough game v Lazio tomorrow, but then easy games until 23 December make him a compelling option. Also, a dark horse for a Team of the Group Stage? 
Marquinhos -- probably the best defender shout. Plays large majority of games, and his match vs Monaco next week may give him a chance at an IF if he plays well. 
Alejandro Gomez -- a personal favorite. His game time is difficult to say as he's returning from injury. I'd expect him to start (scored last week) and has mixed bag of easy and hard fixtures before their winter break. 
Leroy Sané -- one of the best bets. Player of the Month form and if he keeps it up expect some great upgrades. Easier games til mid-December (Manchester derby then Spurs a week later) but also an easy start to 2018 as well.
Kingsley Coman -- thriving with Ribery out injured. Bayern have easy games, and with their attacking potential, it could only be a matter of time before the Frenchman recieves an inform.

Rodrigo -- Valencia are in stunning form and so is this ST (8 goals in the league this season but only 1 per game). A clash with Barca next week, but then a lot of lower teams, so if he keeps scoring he has a good chance at an Inform. 
Recap & outlook
To wrap it up, the Ones to Watch market had another stellar week. We got to see how prices reacted after players recieved their upgrades, and we will get a chance to confirm those trends over this current week. Prices have finally settled from their marked decline, yet that could hold more questions than answers. Some final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Prices are stabilizing, and anytime you have consistency (and patience) let the open bid season begin! Pick a player you feel comfortable with, and look to flip at night for a few extra coins.
-- OTW investors: The elite tier players are still dropping, but a good investment shout could be in those low risk cards around the 15-20k mark. Also, with some leagues taking a winter break make sure you're investing accordingly.

These past few weeks have given us insight into some great trends, so we should be excited to see what next week holds. Keep Black Friday crash potential on your mind, but with prices leveling out it might be time to test the waters.

No repeat of a perfect week, but three out of four is still a pretty good week. In the current selection, EA picked some pretty mainstream fixtures, which bodes well if they can keep up that type of consistency. Yet, this week we’ll definitely still be planning for some curveballs.

As far as predictions go, last week EA had an international vs domestic dilemma, and this week it seems they may have another predicament choosing between European League fixtures, or domestic competitions. We are leaning more towards domestic this week (especially with Juventus included in current MMs), but it always pays to be prepared considering around this time last year EA dropped an all European version of Marquee Matchups. 
European Options
The current Marquee Matchups feature an entire selection of international fixtures, yet next cycle has both international and domestic ties to choose from. Although it is most likely EA will return to club matches, it is important investors stay aware of all possibilities. So, looking at the fixture list here are the four we feel most likely to feature. 
Juventus vs Real Madrid
Sevilla vs Bayern
Barcelona vs Roma
Liverpool vs Manchester City
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Manchester United vs Manchester City
Match Info: Kicking it off with the infamous snub from what feels like way back in FUT now. With no EPL matchup in the current SBC selection, we feel EA won’t overlook it again. A couple options from the fixture list, but we’ll touch on the other one later.     

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Real Madrid vs Atletico Madrid
Match Info:  At this point in FIFA we are starting to see repeat fixtures in terms of high profile derbies, and it seems like EA try to avoid picking duplicate matchups. However, when you have the Madrid Derby, a fixture of this magnitude is always difficult to ignore. So, be patient and stock up on some non-rare golds. 

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Sampdoria vs Genoa
Match Info: Moving to Italy, where there is no shortage of matches that could fit the selection bill this cycle. We opted for the Derby of the Lantern, but matches between AC Milan & Inter, as well as Fiorentina vs Roma deserve consideration too. In order to be best prepared here, we recommend finding non-rare Italians who can can easily get multiple strong links.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Al Ahli vs Al Hilal
Match Info: Rounding out our main picks is a battle between the top two teams in the Saudi League. Just the right amount of fringe for EA, we think this pick would be great to add a little diversity to the main selection. Some quality low risk non-rare silvers here, but if they start to creep up in price sell into the hype! 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 70 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there tends to be some variance each week, let's take a look at some more outside the box picks that could make their way in:
CSKA Moscow vs Dinamo Moscow
Match Info:  A Moscow rivalry had to be pushed down to the sleeper section, but make sure to keep it in mind. This fixture presents another diversity option for EA, but on the brightside for investors there are plenty of low risk options. Look to open bids on the highest rated non-rares. .
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Liverpool vs Everton
Match Info: The second BPL matchup that warrants our attention; however, the Merseyside derby gets pushed down due to the fact it has feature in the MM SBC already. There should be plenty of hype around this fixture, thus selling into the hype might be pretty profitable here.   

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Heerenveen vs Groningen
Match Info: A true sleeper here, we end this section in the Dutch top flight. Not too long ago we picked this to feature, so hopefully the reverse fixture will bring us better luck. This is another option for EA to incorporate some diversity into their selection, but also a fixture that won’t be getting much hype. 

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
Came up empty here last week, but again this section is pretty high risk/high reward anyways. This week we’re putting our trust in a Wyse favorite: Shrewsbury. It’s a cup game, so be warned.   

Lincoln City vs Shrewsbury
Recap
If you're new to Marquee Matchup investing take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team. 
With plenty of big games to choose from we would love to hear your pick below! Also, feel free to share your thoughts on any games we missed."

The beauty of International weeks is that while they don't always deliver on the football front, there's a higher chance you'll get some interesting special player items in FIFA Ultimate Team as a result there of.
FUT 18's Team of the Week 28 is no exception, with Gareth Bale getting his second striker(-ish) in-form and Kyle Walker getting the nod playing CB in an item that with Walker just barely cracking 6'0 could disrupt the meta. It's also good news for those who own his Ones to Watch dynamic player item.
Speaking of OTW, OTW James Rodriguez is now all the way up to 88 overall, becoming one of the better pre-TOTS Bundesliga CAMs. And his Bayern Munich teammate David Alaba has what could be the go-to leftback for many, after scoring a freekick for his Austria.

It must be a Wednesday with a Turkish social media account giving us a head start to who makes up Team of the Week 9.
As expected, a number of high profile World Cup qualifying and International Break standouts get delightful purple Hero player items this week, led by Spurs talisman Christian Eriksen. Sadio Mane, now an 86 overall at right wing, is the other headline maker though 84 Ricardo Rodriguez and 86 Medhi Benatia certainly are nice as well.
The rest of the side has a couple head turning standouts to boot: 89 RM David Silva might work just nicely for some of you who prefer slower buildup play from your outside players. Corentin Tolisso's first Bayern Munich in-form (hello, OTW owners) looks to be a dandy as an 84 CDM. And of course, who could forget 'Sonaldo', better known as Heung-Min Son, Eriksen's club teammates and one of the most OP players from the past two FIFAs returning to our lives. The 84-rated striker player item will be a Weekend League terror in no time.
Here's the complete FIFA 18 Team of the Week 9:"

Market Overview
This past week in FIFA Ultimate Team saw the start of a  much needed, and expected, market recovery. After three exciting Prime Icons last Thursday, the market began to climb up. However with FUT Birthday having a slightly lackluster ending, the decreased hype curtailed the rebound. With the coming week set to be tame, prices should continue to rise, but players should keep on their toes with Team of the Season (TOTS) on the horizon. 
Last week saw extreme price declines across the board for Path to Glory items, yet this week brought some price correction. Overall, the market still seemed to dip, but there were some solid returns on items that should give investors confidence. Since PTG items have the chance to be upgraded based on World Cup performance, these items should hold value for a while, but with domestic seasons ending soon it's important to stay on top of these players’ prices. So, keep reading to find out how you can best utilize these items to build up that coin count for TOTS.

Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats



The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  We are going to continue to preach about looking for hype potential ,and it is even more crucial as domestic seasons end. As player’s club seasons finish, their price drops more and more each week; however, the players that hold their value best are ones with high hype potential. Items with that potential can be seen in large high/low spreads (differences). So, players like Raphael Varane, Jamie Vardy and Thiago present some of the better options here. 
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take: The major trend this past week was the high profile items such as Marcus Rashford, Gabriel Jesus and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic sporting the highest volatilities. Large volatility for players in that price range are expected, but we wanted to highlight the fact that the previous players represent items that have the most to lose before Team of the Season. They have tremendous hype potential, but if you invest in these items sell whenever you see profit!  

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Looking at the rundown graphics it seems there are some crazy figures this week. Well, we think that can be attributed to the PTG market correcting itself alongside the overall FUT Market. Going forward, looking at some interesting figures we believe Leroy Sane, Marquinhos and Ilkay Gundogan are in position to have solid rebounds in the coming weeks if the market continues to rise.. 
TOTW & Upgrade Shout 
Unfortunately no Team of the Week shouts for the upcoming inform side (TOTW28), but it's worth mentioning that Gelson Martins squeaked into the previous side without much hype. This has led to his price staying higher than expected over the preceding week.

Big Winner - Thomas Lemar (AS Monaco)
With the international break in full swing, it is a good time to scout some of the PTG players hoping to make their nation’s World Cup squads. So, even though France fell to Colombia last week, Thomas Lemar put in a quality performance which has us naming him this week’s biggest winner. 
For a player that drummed up serious hype in the early months of FUT, Lemar had fallen off before his inclusion in the “Spring” PTG side. His card has tremendous hype potential, which is evident in his price rise after a goal. So, we wanted to highlight the Monaco winger as a player you want to be looking for in the current PTG market. For an 84 overall special card, his price was pretty close its bottom line making easy for his return to be profitable after the slightest hint of a good performance. 
Yet, the most important thing to highlight is one needs to sell these items into the hype, or you run the risk of losing out on profit in a time when it’ll be few and far between.

Big Loser - Stephan El Shaarawy (Roma) 
Another week with a lot of biggest loser candidates, we wanted to highlight a PTG item with a large weekly price decrease, as well as a player who won’t have a chance of featuring at the World Cup. So, with those filters narrowing our choices we decided on Stephan El Shaarawy as this week’s biggest loser. 
MIssing out on Italy’s squad for the current international friendlies, El Shaarawy always seemed poised for a price decline. This is a perfect case study to provide insight into what to expect when PTG items do not have any fixtures to look forward to at the end of club seasons. 
Outlook wise, there is plenty of time for Stephan to pickup an upgrade and become a big winner. Although Roma drew Barcelona in the UCL, it is still another opportunity for the five star skiller to shine, so although this has been a pleak section there is definitely hope. 
Recap
The FUT market is slowly rebounding, and look for that to continue for the next couple of weeks. Although most Path to Glory players experienced some price dips, it's only a matter of time for them to find their bottom price again. So, make sure to be on the lookout for the low risk investments considering domestic season finishes are on the horizon, as well as Team of the Season looming!           

We’d love to know which PTG players you feel will have the best World Cup? So share below, and as always, lookout for some more dynamic item analysis in our Ones to Watch market update later in the week.

An updated version of FIFA (as well as EA's) Terms of Services makes one thing about the game's companion apps clear: if you use certain Google Chrome extensions/add-ons to try and get a leg up in FIFA 18 to take shortcuts in valuating your club or completing Squad Buildling Challenges, you could receive a strike or even ultimately be banned for it.
While rumors had long circulated that some FIFA web app import/sync extensions put you at risk of possibly having your personal information (most notably your most recent login to the FUT web app) jeopardized, there now appears to be an even more concrete reason not to leverage these otherwise appealing third-party extensions or softwares.
From the updated verion of EA's ""Know the rules in EA SPORTS FIFA 18"" knowledge base article:

Connect to EA Servers using anything other than EA Web or Companion apps or an unmodified platform
You can only access FIFA, FIFA Ultimate Team, and our FIFA servers using an official version of EA SPORTS FIFA, otherwise it breaks our rules. An official version is one that you bought from us or an authorized retailer. You must also use either an unmodified platform or the official FUT Web and FUT Companion Apps to avoid breaking our rules. An unmodified platform is a console or PC that no one has adjusted or added anything to that would change the way it functions. In other words, the console must work the way it did when it came out of the box from an authorized retailer, and the PC does not have any software running to modify the game or the game’s interactions with EA.
If you share your credentials with someone who is using a modified platform, that breaks our rules too. 
We don’t want you to use third party apps and browser extensions because it puts your account at risk. When you use these third-party apps and browser extensions, your login info can be visible to third parties and someone could use that info to take over your account. Browser extensions can capture your passwords, track your web browsing, insert ads into web pages you visit, and more.

Worth noting that even Two-Factor Authorization won't protect your account from third-party extensions you give permission to access it.
The idea of such extensions have long appealed to the FIFA community but perhaps unsurprisingly, there hasn't been a lot of discussion as to whether the personal advantages came at the expense of account security and/or game health. 
Though some will probably instinctively react to these developments saying this is all merely posturing or scare tactics on EA's part, one individual on Twitter claims they are already facing the music for doing so.
It's definitely a bummer that these kind of extensions that certainly have a lot of potential utility appear to carry the risk that they do.
In full disclosure, Futhead, who had an extension in FIFA 16 that did not store your personal information or abuse any game mechanics in any way, explored the possibilities of such automated SBC solution suggestions and other like oft requested features like full club worth analysis before being made aware by EA of the then potential changes to their Terms of Service.
If you've been banned or faced other consequences as a result of using unauthorized third-party extensions, let us know in the comments below or on Twitter or Facebook."

Hometown Homies
Hometown Homies was the working name for Community Favourites, but according to urban myth from tin-foil hat types was a promotion EA had deliberately teased then never released. Well, never fear, because just in time for April Fool's comes the 'real' 24-hour Hometown Homies event! You'll need to complete 7 of the 6 non-repeatable live events within the Hometown Homies chapter to earn yourself an exclusive 'nothing' reward in your achievements, earning yourself a kit and a logo along the way. Enjoy the current EAster promotion, and don't forget to have a look around the Futhead console site for more April Fool's related Easter Eggs!
Weekend Tournament
Weekend Tournament arrives again, and with it come more rewards. The two SBC reward format looks set to stay, however instead of 88 Leroy Sané and 91 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, this time the SBC rewards are 500 Skill Boosts and a 93 CDM Sergio Busquets. The key cog in Barcelona's midfield requires a ST, CAM, CM and a CB averaging 90 OVR with at least one Spaniard and one FC Barcelona player. Don't forget that to actually attempt the SBC, you will need to win 10 games with a maximum of 2 losses. This time around the WT nodal rewards are coins, with a massive 3 million coins available to those who win 10 games.
SBCs
The second round of Weekly Squad Building Challenges arrives as well with POTM Memphis Depay headlining besides an untradeable 86 ST Ahmed Musa and an untradeable 82 CM Rodolfo Pizarro. Depay remains one of the premium LMs available in game, but his SBCs don't come cheap. To earn yourself Depay, you'll need to complete three progressively harder SBCs featuring teams and leagues from throughout Depay's career. Be careful using Dutchmen, Eredivisie/EPL/Ligue 1 players in the first two SBCs, as you don't want to ge to the last SBC and be ruing using a player previously.

Another week with three correct scores, with Colombia’s upset against France being the biggest shock result is the week.
With the domestic season drawing to a close soon, we see some very important games which could claim the league title or make the end of the season a little bit more intense. 
So, let's get into this weeks games.

Bayern Munich v Dortmund
We start off in Germany where the two giants face off in Der Klassiker, a rematch of one of the first Matchup games of the year, and game that could seal the Bundesliga title for Bayern.
Bayern need just four points to win the title, based on second placed Schalke winning every game they have to play. However, with Schalke playing in the early set of game, and Der Klassiker coming a few hours later, Bayern could seal the title with as little as a draw. Before the international break, they suffered a rare defeat at the hands of RB Leipzig, to postpone the celebrations slightly and make it less likely that they would seal the title this week. That loss was their first in all competitions since November. However  they still remain unbeaten at the Allianz, which shows the magnitude of the challenge facing the visitors.
Dortmund went on a decent run of form after the winter break, but their elimination from the Europa League to RB Salzburg has been part of a run of just two wins in seven games.  The second leg 0-0 draw was just the third  time all season that they have failed to score,  with all ending 0-0. That loss to Salzburg was Dortmund’s first loss of the year, with a current run of six wins and seven draws in 14 games since the winter break. 
These games are always very tough to call, with three of the last four games between them being decided by just one goal. In the last 11 games between these two teams, Bayern have won five to Dortmund’s two, with three of the four draws going to extra time in the Pokal or Super Cup. In an odd pattern of results, Bayern have won and then drawn (in 90 minutes) or lost at home to Dortmund in each of their meetings since 2011/12, with the run being LWDWLWDWDWLW. The last game between these two with Bayern as the home side ended 2:1 to the hosts so, if that run continues, Bayern will fail to pick up the victory this weekend.
That being said, I feel like Bayern’s form and motivation to try and seal the title against the team who were the last team to stop them winning the Bundesliga will help them through to pick up three points.
Game played: Saturday 31st, 2:30 p.m. (BST) / 9:30 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Bayern win

Chelsea v Spurs
Our second game is a close matchup between the two best teams in London, as Chelsea host Spurs in a game that could have a big impact on next year's European competitions.
Last season’s title winners find themselves in fifth, and only slightly closer to the current league leaders than to the relegation zone.  The Blues are in need of an upturn in form if they want to get into the Champions League for the fourth time in five season. With just one win in their last six games, and four losses in their last six in the league, they have dropped out of the top four, and a loss this weekend will almost certainly end their Champions League hopes. They face a wait to see if Courtois and Christensen are fit enough to play after injuries ruled them both out over the international break. 
Spurs come into the game on a high, but face a tough end to the season with Harry Kane currently out injured. However Heung-Min Son’s excellent run of form has made the loss of Kane almost unnoticeable. They have the second best away record in the league this season  and will he hoping for that run to continue to this game and beyond. One loss in their last 20 games shows just how good they have been, and just a poor late October and November is stopping them from battling it out for the title.
Spurs appear to have the form advantage, but it is Chelsea who seem to have the upper hand almost every time they meet, especially at Stamford Bridge. Spurs have only won at the Bridge on one occasion since 1991, with Chelsea winning 21 of their 33 meetings in that time. 
This will be a must-watch game, with both sides looking very even. Chelsea know that Spurs struggle when visiting them, but Spurs will be high on confidence with their impressive form of late. I feel like a draw is the most likely result, especially if Courtois is back starting for Chelsea, but if I had to pick a winner then I'd go with Spurs.
Game played: Sunday 1st, 4:00 p.m. (BST) / 11:00 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw

Young Boys v Basel
Next, we had over to Switzerland where the top two teams battle it out in a very important match. League leader Young Boys know that a win on Monday will put them 19 points ahead of their opponents, who have a game in hand, with just 10 games to go. Basel’s elimination from the Champions League means that their focus lies solely on winning the league for the ninth year in a row.
Young Boys have finished second or third in 11 of the past 14 seasons, so the fact that they are in with a chance of taking the title should be surprise. What is surprising is how dominant they have been this season, losing just twice in 26 league games. Their current run of form is incredible, with 14 win in a row in all competitions - scoring 43 and conceding just 13, with five clean sheets.
Basel’s form of late had been very poor, with just three wins so far this year - one of them being the surprise 2-1 win against Manchester City in a game of little importance. Their whole season had been built on a solid defence, but their lack of attacking threat recently is what is costing them dearly, with just six goals scored in their last nine games. 
In recent encounters, the home side has seemed to have the upper hand, with Basel only winning four of the last 20 games with Young Boys as hosts and Basel being undefeated in their last 10 at home. The two met just over a month ago in the Swiss Cup semi-final, with Young Boys coming out on top 2-0, increasing their unbeaten run against Basel to six games.
I feel like this game is a lot closer than the league table may suggest, but Young Boys form overall and recent results are just too good to ignore, so I feel like they'll win this time round again.
Game played: Monday 2nd, 3:00 p.m. (BST) / 10:00 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Young Boys win

Juventus v AC Milan
Lastly, we have a battle between Italian giants from the past two decades. 
After Napoli lost to Roma at the start of the month, Juventus have had the title fate in their hands, knowing that they will get their seventh Scudetto in a row if they will all their remaining games. With their impressive run of form, which has seen them go 18 games unbeaten, including 16 wins. Their last ten games have been insane, having kept 10 clean sheets in a row, with just one goal conceded in their last 15.
Milan’s golden days seem to be a thing of the past, with their current squad not quite as good as the one that had the likes of Nesta, Kaka and Ronaldinho. Despite bring knocked out the Europa League by Arsenal, Milan have also been in a long unbeaten run in the league. Five wins from their last five league games and eight wine from their last ten has seen them match almost match Juventus for form.
The hosts also have a big upper hand in head to head, with seven wins and two draws in three last ten games at either venue, conceding just six goals in those games. The last time Milan scored more than once against the Turin side was back in 2013 in a 3-2 loss, and it will take something just as impressive to do the same again this time.
With just five points dropped at home all season, Juventus are almost unstoppable, and I can't see Milan getting anything from this game because of just how good Juve are.
Game played: Saturday 31st, 7:45 p.m. (BST) / 2:45 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Juventus win

That's what I think will happen this week. If you are lucky enough to get 4/4 then you have the choice between picking up AC Milan’s young attacking prodigy Patrick Cutrone, or you can pick up some skill boosts instead to help get you close to that next level. 
As always, good luck and happy predicting!"

It was International Week last week, which brings with it an entire world of wonderous in-form possibilities. These are the toughest weeks in the FIFA calendar year for Predictions gurus, but Aaron has done an admirable job missing just ten players from TOTW 28. But all the same we have Iniesta, Lingard and Alaba to discuss and also the scariest centre back in FUT 18. Let's go! 
Andres Iniesta – CM – Barcelona/Spain
Spain and Germany duked it out in a heavyweight International Friendly clash on Friday night where it ended up honours even with a 1-1 draw in Dusseldorf. So, no likely IF candidates you would think, but Iniesta makes the cut for his assist (and what an assist it was) for Rodrigo Moreno who opened the scoring in the 6th minute before Thomas Muller levelled things up. 
Aarons View: One assist in a 1-1 draw; I feel this one has been included due to it being two big teams facing off. Usually Iniesta would stand no chance of a TOTW spot.
Jesse Lingard – CM – Man United/England
With Dele Alli in less than sparkling form for Three Lions, this was Jesse Lingard’s week to grab a seat on the plane to Russia and grab it he most likely did, scoring the winner against Netherlands in England’s 1-0 win, and picking up a quick thinking assist versus Italy a few days later. England have plenty of attacking midfield options but based on form, Jesse is definitely in the hot seat right now.

Aarons View: I opted for Pickford due to the usual goalkeeper scenario we see during international weeks. Lingard was another option after he scored the only goal in a 1-0 win.
David Alaba – LWB – Bayern Munich/Austria
There were two IF’s for Austria this week, with their 3-0 win against Slovenia being handsomely rewarded by EA. One IF went to Marco Arnautovic for his brace, and the other to David Alaba who opened the scoring for Austria in the 15th minute, and of course helped to secure his sides clean sheet. Amazingly this is Alaba’s first IF proper of 2018. 
Aarons View: I still believe that Alaba was deployed as an LM rather than a LWB, which alongside Arnaoutovic also making the cut was not enough for me.
Kyle Walker – CB – Man City/England
In a surprise move by Gareth Southgate, career right back Kyle Walker was deployed as a centre back in both of England's games against the Netherlands and Italy. But he took to the role like a duck to water with his mobility and range of passing impressing on the right side of a back three. His repositioning is the likely reason for this IF, above the single clean sheet. But more importantly FUT has a new centre back overlord. Embrace him. 
Aarons View: I didn’t have Walker down as a consideration with both Pickford and Lingard ahead in the pecking order. He does make one hell of an IF though.
Kasper Schmeichel – GK – Leicester City/Denmark
Denmark started their International Friendlies this week with a less than convincing 1-0 win against World Cup newcomers Panama, but things did improve somewhat in their second game as they held Chile to a 0-0 draw at home. So that made it two International clean sheets in a row for Kasper Schmeichel and therefore he strolls in to TOTW 28. 
Aarons View: International weeks often bring up random keeper IFs, with Pantillimon famously included for one save. Now we have Kasper who did pretty much nothing.
Yasser Al Mosailem – GK – Al Ahli/Saudi Arabia
One of the toughest IF’s to pick-out this week was undoubtedly Yasser Al Mosailem who only played in one of Saudi Arabia’s Internationals last week which was; a 1-1 draw away to the Ukraine. With limited game info on this one I’m going to have to assume he made some saves in this one. And if so, he absolutely nailed being a goalkeeper. 
Aarons View: I have no data on this one so I can’t really comment on the selection. Ukraine v. Saudi Arabia was always going to be difficult outside of goals.
Matthijis De Ligt – CB – Ajax/Netherlands
After their disappointing loss to England, the Netherlands bounced right back against Portugal beating them handsomely 3-0. Cancelo was sent off for Portugal early in the second half but the damage was already done with goals from Depay, Babel and Van Djiik all coming in the first half. De Ligt picked up two assists from centre half, a clean sheet and pocketed Ronaldo. A good day out for the young man who will surely have the big boys of Europe circling in the summer. 
Aarons View: Due to De Ligt having two previous IFs, I opted for team mate VDV, who scored one of the three goals. Alongside his OTW item, that gave him the edge in my mind.
Vincent Aboubakar – CAM – Porto/Cameroon
Cameroon took on Kuwait on Sunday where Christian Bassogog put himself in the TOTW 28 IF mix with two of his sides goals in their 3-1 win. The IF however, goes to Vincent Aboubakar who scored the other goal and picked up an assist too. Bit of a nothing game here even as friendlies go, so another tough IF to predict this week. 
Aarons View: The African games are often difficult to find correct positions for and as such I was unaware that Aboubakar played a CAM role, when I had him down as a ST.
Blerim Dzemaili – LM – Bologna/Switzerland
Switzerland took on Greece and Panama during the International break and they recorded back-to-back wins. Blerim Dzmali was prominent in both games scoring Switzerland’s only goal against Greece and notching against Panama along with five of his team mates in their 6-0 demolition. 
Aarons View: One goal midfielders were always going to be seen this week. I opted for another in Topal but EA decided to go with Dzemali instead, who did exactly the same.
Bryan Ovideo – LWB – Sunderland/Costa Rica
And finally, Costa Rica took on Scotland at Hamden Park on Friday where they took an early lead through Marco Urena and they held that lead right to the end recording a 1-0 win. The assist for that goal came from Bryan Oviedo who also recorded a clean sheet to take the IF in what is likely to be Sunderland’s one and only IF of the season. 
Aarons View: One assist for a Silver defender. I felt there were far better options available in domestic divisions."

Another 3/4 last week makes us in good predicting form, so hopefully we're able to match or even beat that this week.
A couple of tough games in France, Germany and Turkey, along with a big clash in the Premier League make for interesting predicting this week.
Let's get into this weeks games.

Lyon v Saint-Etienne
We start off with what is hopefully a fairly straightforward game to predict.
Lyon currently sit fourth in the table, and will be hoping that they can find some form again after going through a rough patch, which has seen them pick up just four points from their last 15 -- dropping them six points behind Marseille and seven behind Monaco, who they will be aiming to catch up with to gain entry to the Champions League next season. They also have to deal with a tough second leg in the Europa League on Thursday night, having won their first leg 3-1 against Villarreal so the tie is far from over.
Saint-Etienne are right in the middle of the table, sitting in the middle of a big pack of sides where 10 points is all that’s between 7th and 19th. They have been in good form recently, with three wins from their last four games - a run which has seen them go up from 16th to 11th.
Lyon’s 5-0 win in the reserve fixture back in November was the first time in five matches that the home side has failed to win, so Saint-Etienne will no doubt be hoping to get some revenge for that game. However their poor form recently, along with a tough away game on Thursday night, makes it a lot tougher to predict than it may look. I still think that Lyon should take the win, but it will be a tough one to for them.
Game time: Sunday 25th, 4:00 p.m. (GMT) / 11:00 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Lyon win

Manchester United v Chelsea
The biggest game this week is the Premier League clash between second and fourth. 
When Mourinho’s team came out for their Champions League first leg tie against Sevilla, it was clear that he was thinking about this game. Resting some big names like Pogba and Martial shows that his mindset was to try and grind out a reasonable result against Sevilla, then focus on winning the game at home this weekend and also their home leg against Sevilla in a couple of weeks time. Their form recently hasn’t been great, having lost two of their last four games. However both of those games were away from Old Trafford, and they are unbeaten in their last six games at home, with five clean sheets in those six games. 
Chelsea pulled off a shock result by drawing 1-1 at home to Barcelona. They seem to have found some form recently with two solid wins over West Brom and Hull, but they need to be able to carry that form over to away games if they want to keep challenging for Champions League spots. With just one win in their last six away games -- a 4-0 thrashing of Brighton -- they are struggling away from home and a game like this is the perfect time to find their form once again.
In the past four meetings between these sides, the home side has won each time and kept a clean sheet. Chelsea have been the dominant side in this tie in recent years, with seven wins compared to United’s one in the last 12 meetings. I can see this being a very close game, but with Chelsea coming into the game high on confidence from Tuesday’s draw, they should have a slight upper hand over a United side who seem incapable of creating chances. A draw wouldn’t surprise me, but I’m going a narrow Chelsea win.
Game time: Sunday 25th, 2:05 p.m. (GMT) / 9:05 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Chelsea win

Werder Bremen v Hamburg
At the opposite end of the table in Germany,  15th host 17th as Bremen and Hamburg face off in a relegation six-pointer. 
Going into the winter break, both sides were level on 15 points, but Bremen managed a couple of solid performances and now sit six points ahead of their opponents. Wins over Schalke and Wolfsburg, and an extra time loss in the Pokal to Leverkusen, has shown that they are finding good form as they push to avoid relegation.
Hamburg seem to always find a way to avoid relegation, having been involved in a relegation battle in the past four seasons,  played in two relegation playoffs and only just avoiding it the playoff year thanks to a win on the last game of the season. They look set to be involved in another relegation battle this year, as they sit just three points ahead of a Köln side who were on just six points going into the winter break, and now have to gain six points on Mainz and Bremen to even try and get out of the automatic relegation spots.
This game will be very scrappy, but I believe that the hosts will come out on top as they have managed to go nine games unbeaten at home, and have only lost at home to Hamburg once since 2010.
Game time: Saturday 24th, 5:30 p.m. (GMT) / 12:30 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Bremen win

Besiktas v Fenerbahce
Lastly we go to Turkey where fourth host third. Both sides will be hoping for a win to keep up their title challenge, as they try and keep pace with surprise league leaders Basaksehir. 
Besiktas are in solid form in the league, having gone unbeaten since before Christmas. However, they were on the wrong end of a thrashing on Tuesday night when Bayern eased past them with a 5-0 win. At home, they have won eight of their last nine games, and haven't lost at all this season at home.
Fenerbahce’s form has been just as good as their opponents. With just two losses in the league this season -- both happening before the end of September -- they are in great form and will be hoping to extend their unbeaten run against Besiktas to 6 games. 
This is probably the toughest game to predict this week, but I feel like home advantage may help Besiktas recover from their Champions League demolition and give them a better chance, but I feel like a draw is fairly likely given both teams recent form and how past games have ended up.
Game time: Sunday 25th, 4:00 p.m. (GMT) / 11:00 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw

That's what I think will happen this week. All going well, you will earn yourself an 85 Overall Ricardo Quaresma. If you choose not to pick him, or don't manage to get all four correct, then you can pick up some Skill Boosts instead. 
Good luck and happy predicting!"

Today, it's all about Leon Goretzka. The Germany and Schalke midfield powerhouse is turning out be quick a midfielder in real life, and it's carrying over to FUT 18. He's received an incredible 82-rated item, with some of the best stats in the game.

In-Game Stats
To say his stats are phenomenal would be an understatement. Just looking at his face card stats, he's got a 4-star weak foot, no card stats below 73, H/H work rates, he's 6'2, and boasts a whopping 469 total card stats (which is one of the highest in all of FIFA 18).
His in-game stats are pretty special. Not only is he fast (which 83 acceleration and 85 sprint speed), but he's also technically gifted, great on the ball, solid both offensively and defensively, and can run all game long.

I used him with the Basic chemistry style, which gives him a nice all-round boost:

Squad
I used Goretzka in this team:

The team is extremely, extremely solid. It completely bulldozes the AI on Legendary, and wrecked the two online opponents I faced.
Stats
I've used Goretzka for seven games so far, and here are my stats with him:
Price: 3,700 coins (He's now ~16,000)
Games: 7
Goals: 6
Assists: 2
Let's get into this review.
Review
Pace: 10/10
Everything you could possibly need in a central midfielder, and a lot more. Covers ground effortlessly, tearing up and down the pitch. His pace is incredibly useful when defending, and devastating in attack. It's one of my favorite things about the card, and makes him an absolute animal in game.
Dribbling: 10/10
For a big man, he's got a great touch. Ball-control is touch tight, first touch is reliable, and he can stop and turn with ease. He dribbles very smootly in game, and doesn't feel clunky at all. Genuinely glides across the pitch effortlessly.
Shooting: 8/10
From distance, he is lethal. Popped a couple of long shots with him, and they all went in. Inside the box, finishing is a little dodgy, but he gets them on target to win us a corner, or create a chance from a rebound. His heading is very, very good, and he scored a couple for me (by virtue of his jumping, height and heading accuracy).
Passing: 9/10
He may have only got two assists, but he's an integral part of my midfield. His distribution is top quality. Short- and long-passing and very, very good, and with his pace, his crossing is incredibly effective. He can play the role of playmaker with ease, and I'm sure that if I moved him further up the field, he'd rack up assists.
Defending: 9/10
Tackling is perfect. With his pace, long legs, and decent strength and aggression, he can dispossess anyone. He does it efficiently too, without giving away too many fouls, or missing many tackles. Interceptions are also very good, as is his marking -- he reads the game well, and covers his opponents effectively. His heading accuracy is very good, and he can direct headed passes very easily, as well as registering headers on target.
Physicality: 10/10
This is where he dominates. He feels far stronger in game, and his aggression and lanky frame means he plays like a tank in-game. He very hard to bully off the ball, and puts up a fight against every player he faces. His stamina is excellent, so he's running until the very last minute, and it makes him an incredibly useful asset to have at the end of games.
Summary
He's an incredible all-round player, and a true midfield maestro. I can't see how you can do much better than him. His play style and attributes really fit the meta this year, and he plays well above his rating in-game.
In the week leading up to the official release, I'll be trying to review as many players as possible. If you have any suggestions on what players you want reviewed, or if you have any questions about the ones I have already reviewed, feel free to comment below, or send me a tweet (@Wookiechew23)!"

Last week's score: 20/23
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad Link: http://www.futhead.com/18/squads/298129/


Goalkeeper
Adan - GK - OVR 81
Despite it coming in a set of mid-week fixtures, one of the surprising fixtures in contention comes with Real Betis managing a 1-0 win over Real Madrid. Usually in these shock results, there is a stand out player, and this one’s no exception with Adan putting in an outstanding performance making a total of seven saves.
Defenders
Faouzi Ghoulam - LB - OVR 79
Although Ghoulam and Napoli have two goals against them against Spal, a late goal and assist from Ghoulam allowed them to steal three points via a 3-2 win. Those three points allowed Napoli to remain at the top of the table winning six from six.
Hilton- CB - OVR 78
One of only a few punts this week comes with Hilton. There were no clear-cut options from France and thus we have to be imaginative; the only realistic options for them come from the defensive side of things with the attack jam packed. Hilton helped Montpellier to keep a clean sheet against PSG and picked up a 7 from L'Équipe making him a viable option.
Frank Fabra - LB - OVR 76
Boca Juniors recorded another comfortable win as they continued their early dominance in Argentina. Fabra picked up an assist on the opening goal before scoring one of his own to seal a 4-0 win for them. 
Midfielders
Stephan El Shaarawy - LW - OVR 80
A fan favourite in El Shaarawy managed to score twice for Roma in a 3-1 home win over Udinese. In doing so Stephan picked up the MOTM award with a 7.5 from Gazzetta.
Miralem Pjanic - CM - OVR 85
Another week, another Juventus IF. Just like Napoli, The Old Lady have won all six of the matches they have played. Once again it was Pjanic who stood out, claiming a goal and two assists. Alternatively, Alex Sandro who scored could feature, but with Pjanic earning the higher rating, I believe it will go to the Bosnian.
James Rodriguez - CAM - OVR 86
Rodriguez is potentially the man who will receive one of the first OTW upgrades after he claimed both a goal and an assist in Munich's mid-week win. By doing so he picked up POTW, and with PEA being the only obvious option from the weekend from Bundesliga, it only helps his cause.
Leroy Sane - RM - OVR 82
I'm almost certain that we will see a City IF this week but as to who that will be is a difficult question to answer: Sane with a goal and two assists, Sterling with a brace or Silva with two assists. From watching parts of the game, Sane was the main man in my eyes causing a constant threat down the right flank. 
Forwards
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - ST - OVR 88
Another side jumping in on the Week 2 IF bandwagon is Dortmund. With the speed demon himself being on the receiving side of it, many FUT fans will be rubbing their hands. The Gabonese striker was involved in four of six Dortmund goals, scoring three alongside picking up an assist.
Lionel Messi - ST - OVR 93
Messi is one of several players of whom managed to score four goals this week. Barcelona went on to win the match 6-1 as they hosted Eibar. Although it was once again a mid-week game, with multiple high-profile leagues playing and Frecklington being included last week, all signs suggest that Messi will be included.
Morata - ST - OVR 84
Morata has made an instant impact in the Premier League, making Costa a distant memory in the process. Although before this week his goals came primarily from headers, he found his shooting boots against Stoke, scoring three of their four goals in a 4-0 win.
Substitutes
Mamadou Samassa - GK - OVR 74
The French league is often a reliable source for goalkeeper’s due to L'Équipe's high ratings on for them. We had Ruffier in the opening side and now we are set for Samassa in TOTW 2. The Troyes stopper made a total of seven saves with the majority of the second half being played with 10 men to help Troyes claim a 1-0 away win, claiming an 8/10 rating in the process.
Danny Grainger - LB - OVR 63
There were several options for the bench defender spot with multiple double attacking contributions popping up. For me, the best of the bunch was Grainger, who not only scored twice from LB, but also helped to keep a clean sheet. On top of that, although it is not officially an assist, he did put in the cross which caused the OG; all things pointing in his favour.
Yamil Asad - LM - OVR 71
It's no longer an impressive feat to beat LA Galaxy, so although a 4-0 win looks brilliant on paper, its now a game Atlanta United would expect to win. Asad had a say in all four of those goals, scoring two and assisting another two which with the new system almost guarantees him a spot in the side.
Yoane Wissa - LM - OVR 64
Although it appears that Bronze IFs are near a thing of the past, silvers are not quite out. With bronze players being upgraded to silvers, and with the impressive upgrades being applied, Wissa could be a decent one at that. The Frenchman scored three times during Ajaccio's 6-1 away win.
Manuel Konrad -CDM - OVR 67
Although Dresden failed to win the game due to conceding two late goals to tie, 3-3, the fact that Konrad scored a hat trick from CDM is something you just can't overlook. There are several lower league German players in contention this week, but for me, Konrad is the best of them.
Carmelo Valencia - ST - OVR 67
La Equidad made it a five-game unbeaten streak to hop up to 4th courtesy of a 3-0 win. Valencia scored all three of said goals making him a prime candidate for this week’s side.
Patrick Mullins - ST - OVR 65
We finish off a straight forward bench with another player of whom picks himself in Mullins. The DC striker scored all four of their goals in a routine 4-0 win at home to San Jose Earthquakes, making it two MLS players selected. Although while all leagues are playing two from a league like the MLS rarely happens, it's tough to argue against it.
Reserves
Dani Ceballos - CM - OVR 78
Ceballos is yet another rising Spanish youngster who seems to be breaking through the ranks in La Liga. The 21-year-old scored both of Real Madrid's goals in a narrow 2-1 away win over Alaves.
Yacine Brahimi - LM - OVR 82
The Portuguese league contained one of only the three I missed in the opening side. Trying not to make the same mistake this time around, I am predicting Brahimi. The Algerian scored twice during a 5-2 home win claiming MOTM in the process.
Simone Zaza - ST - OVR 80
Zaza makes it two La Liga strikers to make the cut from Tuesday games. The Italian, who finds himself over in Spain after failed attempts in England, has hit the ground running, finding the net on three occasions this time around in a 5-0 home win for Valencia.
Jurgen Locadia - ST - OVR 76
Another four goals now, this time in a convincing 7-1 win for PSV. The majority of Locadia's goals came while the game was still competitive too, if you for some reason were not set on the Dutchman. Just to top things off, he also claimed POTW.
Vagner Love - ST - OVR 79
The hat tricks just keep coming! Although there were two penalties involved, considering that both players who managed the same last week were included, I can see Vagner Love joining that list. After all, his goals were vital considering Alanyaspor went on to win 4-3"

Today we look at one of the most overlooked and under-appreciated players in FUT 18 (IMO) -- the one and only Henrikh Mkhitaryan. The Armenia and Manchester United ace received an 85-rated card this year, with a nice little +3 pace boost over his card in FUT 17.

In-Game Stats
Even without a chemistry boost, Mkhitaryan has some of the best stats in the Premier League. Boasting 88 acceleration, 84 sprint speed, 82 positioning, 87 shot power, 85 vision, 84 short passing, 89 agility, 85 balance, 87 ball control and dribbling, 86 stamina, a five-star weak foot and four-star skills, he's a complete player.

I used him with the Hawk chemistry style, which takes his pace up to 93, his shooting up to 86 (with 97 shot power and 86 long shots), and his physical up to 75.

Squads
I've used Mkhi in a variety of teams, but they've all been in the 4321 formation. He plays as a RF with instructions to get in behind and press the backline.
I'm currently running this team:

Stats
I've now used Mkhitaryan for 26 games (for some reason, my EA Access is glitched and it doesn't count down properly, giving me more time to play), and these are his stats after those games:
Price: 11,500 (my second purchase of FUT 18, ten minutes after EA Access came out)
Games: 26
Goals: 15
Assists: 17
Let's get into the review.
Review
Pace: 9/10
He feels like he has around 85-90 pace, which is more than enough for a RF in this game. His pace is more than enough to get past most opposition defenders and midfielders, though he can struggle with some of the faster fullbacks. However, combined with his dribbling, it is a deadly weapon.
Dribbling: 10/10
The best I've used this year, bar none. He feels incredible on the ball, and it makes him lethal in game. Perfect dribbling, a consistent first touch, and the ability to execute skill moves with ease all make him a truly elite player. I was fortunate enough to be able to try out Pogba, and this card is far, far better on the ball than the Frenchman.
Shooting: 10/10
Not only is his shooting incredible, but it's equally good on either foot. He can score anything -- finesse shots, long shots, low driven finishes, or just power shots that almost tear the static nets. Get him into a pocket of space, and let one rip -- he'll always hit the target, and more often than not, he'll bury it. Absolutely unreal.
Passing: 10/10
He's the creative heart of my team. Passing is absolutely perfect, both over short and long distances. Crossing is the best I've used this year, and it creates so many opportunities for Martial and Ibrahimovic (and Antonio, when he's in the squad). Once again, the five-star weak foot means he can do it with either foot, making him very hard to read and close down. He feels like an elite passer, and I struggle to see how to improve in this category.
Defending: N/A
Doesn't have to do much as a RF, but good pace and physical stats often let him win the ball back high up the field.
Physical: 9/10
Feels very strong in game, and has enough stamina to run the full 90 (or 120) minutes. I am especially surprised at how strong he feels compared to defenders -- he often holds them off, or even wins the challenges. However, he can't hold off the strongest players for too long.
Summary
I love this card. He's a lot of fun to use, and is very effective in game. The five-star weakfoot is a game-changer, and it elevates him to the level of the best players in the game. He's killing it for me as a RF, but if you could use him centrally (as a CM or CAM), he might be even better.
In the week leading up to the official release, I'll be trying to review as many players as possible. If you have any suggestions on what players you want reviewed, or if you have any questions about the ones I have already reviewed, feel free to comment below, or send me a tweet (@Wookiechew23)!"

I guess at least you can say, it sure is a Team of the Week.
The star power of TOTW 10 spoiled us undoubtedly, but its successor leaves perhaps more than a little to be desired. A few pick may well turn your head, amongst them a tasty 89 CAM Antoine Griezmann and thigh-goal-redirecting-hero 86 Raheem Sterling.
The other highlights for this week's squad include Olympique Lyon's (and brief Manchester United player) Memphis Depay, Paris Saint Germain's Marco Verratti, and YouTuber/influencer FIFA 17 favorite, Casemiro of Real Madrid, a week after many thought he would/should get an in-form. 
The rest is a mixed bag, some discard, some nice glue guys for specific league squads. LWB Marvin Zeegelaar might be nice?

DJ Khaled is working overtime these days as we're set for yet another Throwback Thursday.
Today's peak Prime Icon is Frenchman Laurent Blanc. At 79 Pace, he's not the blazer his fellow countryman Marcel Desailly was a week ago, but at 92 Defense and 86 Physical, he could quickly become a favorite amongst high level FUT players.
Not lost in the mix is Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert, a sold mix of Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, and Physicality. He won't fit every FIFA players' play-style, but he's sure to cause some headaches in the Weekend League.
Finally, Danish CAM Michael Laudrup closes out this week's release, with an 85 Pace, 90 Passing, 92 Dribbling Prime Icon sure to link up nicely in the right formation with Christian Eriksen.
As per usual, Squad Buildling Challenge unlockable Untradeables are here for the rest of FIFA 18 and tradeable versions are packable for the life of the game. 20-match Loan versions will be available for the next week"

Market Overview
Dominating the headlines this week was EA’s Lunar New Year promotion! Lightning rounds, two-for-one packs, and Flash Squad Building Challenges combined for a perfect storm that drove down prices across the FUT market. This new year promotion dip was expected, so hopefully you sold into the hype. All hope is not lost as prices have been rebounding, and they look to continue to climb over the next couple of weeks. 
Unfortunately, the Path to Glory market followed the general FUT market down, with most players having negative price trends. That being said, there are some bright spots, in the form of a couple huge TOTW Shout, while the statistics also point to price stabilization. Keep reading to see how you can find your own path to glory in the PTG market.  

Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  A rough week for a lot of items usually means some pretty large high/low differences. That can be useful for buyers who are looking to see where an items hype can go, and bigger ranges provide better insight. With that in mind, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Saul and Divock Origi could be poised for some pretty hefty price increases if the notch a goal. 
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take: Interestingly, this week yielded some high volatility figures we hadn’t seen in a while. Player prices were all over the board during Lunar New Year, but high volatility is good for high risk/high reward investors. Looking at the rundown, if volatility is your game look for players like Tiemoue Bakayoko, Kingsley Coman and Danny Welbeck. 
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of a card to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Another week of mixed betas, with a slight majority being smaller figures. The small figures are an indicator of price stabilization, although the large figures provide insight into some high potential individuals. It seems like the left sided trio of Alejandro Gomez, Emil Forsberg and Stephen El Shaarawy could all be poised for big price boosts (if the hype is there). 
TOTW Shout 
Two marquee players highlight the Team of the Week shouts, as FIFA17 favortie Giuliano looks poised for a second inform and Real Madrid wonderkid Marco Asensio should get a tidy boost. Interestingly, they both look to become 86 overall if included, illuminati. 
Big Winner - Marco Asensio  (Real Madrid)
After a terrific start to the season, Marco Asensio seemed to fade for a couple months. Now, it seems like he’s back on the horse and after a solid weekend performance he is poised for a TOTW upgrade, but more importantly is our biggest winner! 
The 22 year-old’s price skyrocketed this weekend, but that is to be expected due to the hype around Real Madrid players. A 165.7% weekly return is enormous, so if you invested, GG. At the end of the day it comes down to if you should sell or hold. Honestly, we’re leaning towards selling into the hype which has been the montra all year. The main factor behind that is: are you willing to pay 90k for rather slow 86 (if upgraded) overall LW?
Regardless, we’re happy to see Asensio performing well again, and with loads of more fixtures a couple of upgrades could be in the cards.

Big Loser - Tiemoue Bakayoko (Chelsea)
A rough week for most PTG items means picking a biggest loser was tricky. After reviewing the stats, and taking a couple minutes to think, we landed on Tiemoue Bakayoko as our biggest loser. 
Around a 26% decline was too much to ignore, but in Bakayoko’s case there is more than meets the eye. Digging into more numbers, the Frenchman’s volatility was rather high (~8,000) for his price point. Coupled with a middling beta (-0.43), the ex-Monaco man presents an interesting case for investors going forward. He has tremendous hype potential  which could drive his price through the roof; however, without a strong performance his price will most likely continue to drop. 
If you’d like to wrestle with the sticky situation above be our guest, just make sure those invested coins are excess, and not vital to your supply
. 
Recap
Overall, the PTG market took a hit alongside EA’s Lunar New Year promotion. Seeing that the PTG followed the general FUT market trend during the promotion, look for items’ prices to rise alongside the FUT market in the coming week, or two. Even with mostly negative returns, a couple TOTW shouts demonstrated the PTG market still has relevance, which is key as domestic leagues draw to a close.             

Leave your thoughts on how EA could utilize these cards below!

Market Overview
Happy belated Black Friday and Thanksgiving to those who celebrated. EA kicked off the holiday season in a somewhat pleasantly surprising fashion. The Flash SBCs were mostly on point, especially the Team of the Week player ones. On top of that, they offered the expected packs; however, I echo those that wish they had offered some sort of discount on those.
Now as a whole, the market did see a decline in player prices, which again was expected. But, it is important to note that many special cards and Ones to Watch (OTW) kept their value fairly well. So, with some of these prices may be a little higher although by reviewing the previous week one can see the trends of how the OTW market dealt with the Black Friday hype and uncertainty. 

Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take: This week it's important to note that many of the “highs” for this week come from the overnight price I took on November 17. It's a little experiment to test when is the best time to sell, and I will be looking to confirm that in the coming weeks. 
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take: Volatility returned this week, which is largely due to Black Friday uncertainty. As usual, look to the elite players for the highest risk/reward options, but the likes of Keita Balde Diao and Serge Aurier can be nice trading options for the medium budget players. 
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of a card to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Looking at the graph above, a good amount of players have some pretty high betas. Notably, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Leonardo Bonucci, and Douglas Costa could all see significant price shifts depending on if you think the market will go back up. 
TOTW Shout
Just one real TOTW shout with Mohamed Salah putting away a couple goals. Always an uphill battle though with him receiving an inform two weeks ago. 
In-depth daily analysis

For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner -- Alvaro Morata (Chelsea)
Beside the hype around Salah and Tolisso receiving another inform, the real big winner is Alvaro Morata. Part of his increase is due to him scoring against Manchester United the previous weekend; however, people are also realizing he is getting plenty of game time and scoring a few goals. 
For “elite” players, his volatility is low (~12,000), which points to his card’s steady increase over the week. But his Beta is high at around 2.20 shedding light on the fact that the ex-Madrid man’s price has potential to shift heavily based on the market’s performance. Based on the preceding points, a starting role in a solid team could mean we see Morata back in the Winner spotlight for real if he can pick up another upgrade       

Big Loser -- Alexandre Lacazette (Arsenal)
For the past couple of weeks I should have seen this coming, as Alexandre Lacazette has seen a sharp dip in price during the “crash”. This week was more of the same as the Frenchman saw an overall -13.7% shift. It was not the largest percentage drop; however, looking at the past two weeks data it has definitely been significant. 
With a high volatility (~20,100) and a low beta (-.056), Lacazette demonstrated the frustration of investors that have been holding his card. His large price fluctuations have been mostly negative and he seems to be reflecting whatever is the current state of the market . That being said, the market seems to be in a slight uptick post Black Friday, and Arsenal seemed strong in their win over Spurs, so maybe Lacazette can turn it around 
Team of the Group Stage Watch
For the past couple FIFAs, at the conclusion of the Champions and Europa league group stages EA have released a team of special items for players who’ve performed exceptionally well. This batch of special items, aka Team of the Group Stage (TTGS) will also warrant an upgrade for a player’s corresponding One to Watch, or Path to Glory items. So, here’s a look at some players worth considering...
Mohamed Salah -- The Liverpool winger has been in scorching form and that has translated to his Champions league performances, notching 4 goals & 1 assist through the first five games. If he can put together another impressive performance in the final game, we should see an even more OP upgrade. 

Ederson Moraes -- With 3 Clean Sheets through five games, the new Manchester City goalkeeper has definitely impressed. After very compelling group performance 
Emiliano Rigoni -- Shifting focus to the Europa league and Path to Glory players, the Zenit winger has owned his group. 6 goals and 1 assist see the Argentine as the joint top scorer in the competition putting him in pole position for a TTGS. 
Stephen El Sharaawy -- A little bit of a dark horse, but it's important to remember he destroyed Chelsea in Match Week 4. Just 2 goals and 1 assist seem lacking, but he’s not getting much hype; therefore, could be a nice low risk/high reward player. 
For the big boy investors: 
Neymar ( 6 Goals and 4 assists), alongside his teammate Kylian Mbappe ( 3 goals and 3 assists) look like great options after leading Paris Saint-Germain to the top of their group and into the round of 16
Sleeper pick: Davidson Sanchez (Tottenham)
Recap & outlook
To wrap it up, weekly returns were mixed this week mostly brought on by many people questioning the events of the weekend. Currently, when this article goes live the prices of most special cards (OTW & PTG) have seen a slight rise in value. Some final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Post Black Friday prices are causing OTWs to rise slightly, so look to open bids and sell overnight for some great flips.
-- OTW investors: Hopefully you picked up some great deals in the early hours of Black Friday, but Cyber Monday could also help lower prices. On top of that make sure you are investing accordingly with TTGS and winter breaks approaching.

Over the past week, the uncertainty of Black Friday carried over to the OTW market, yet it seems that prices have stabilized and even risen As always, the week has offered fascinating insights into players prices, and I look forward to what next week holds.

In today's FIFA 18 Early Access launch's poorest kept secret, FUT 18 Team of the Week 1 is here.
Our own Aaron Grimmer pretty much hit the nail on the head, correctly predicting 20 of the 23 players to make the squad. But in an interesting surprise, the way silver and bronze base items are being upgraded seem to be happening in a dramatic departure from previous years of Ultimate Team.
Gone evidently are the 73-and-below-to-74 and 63-and-less-to-64 silver and bronze respective bumps of yesteryear. In what's possibly going to devalue FUT Champions rewards a touch, silvers seem to be getting more dramatic boosts to gold and bronzes to silver.
If there were ever any questions that silver and bronze's place in the FUT ecosystem have been relegated to Squad Buildling Challenges only, this is a sure sign. It's nice to have more gold inform items, undoubtedly. But it's also a bit of a bummer for those hardcore collectors and/or bronze pack method aficionados.

It's a Tuesday, so the latest FIFA 18 Marquee Matchups Squad Buildling Challenges are here. FUT Economist and Futhead's WyseFIFA came just a bit short of a second straight perfect week, but three of the four matchups are as expected.
Let's start at the top with the group rewards. If you don't do these SBCs regularly or are new to FIFA Ultimate Team, you have to complete all four of the SBCs in the group in order to receive the group reward. 
We'll subsequently work our way down through each of the sub groups taking a look at roughly what they'd cost to do at the time this was published, what the coin price of the rewards would ordinarily be, as well as a rough approximation of the minimum for what you could expect to sell the contents for in normal circumstances.
Group Reward: Rare Electrum Players Pack (30k)
 -- 12 items, 6 gold, 6 silver, 12 rare (~6.4k)

Juve vs. Napoli (~10k)
  -- Jumbo Premium Gold Pack (15k)
    -- 24 items, 20 gold, 4 silver, 7 rare (~8k)
Porto vs. Benfica (~8k)
  -- Rare Mixed Players pack (?)
    -- 12 items, 4 gold, 4 silver, 4 bronze, 12 rare (~4.7k)
Besiktas vs. Galatasaray (~6k)
  -- Small Gold Players Pack
    -- 6 items, 5 gold, 1 silver, 1 rare (~2.1k)
Aberdeen vs. Glasgow Rangers (~3.5k)
 -- Rare Consumables Pack (20k)
 -- 12 items, 12 gold, 12 rare (~5.5k)

Totals/Conclusions:
-- Costs: ~27.5k
-- Pack Values at discard: ~26.7k
-- It's actually not half bad considering player prices right now
-- If anything, you should 100% do Aberdeen vs. Glasgow Rangers!


It'll be interesting to see if the end of the Black Friday SBCs (including the vaunted guaranteed TOTW SBC) have the expected impact on 83/84-overall's prices. Market-wide prices increasing overall, however, may offset some of the potential opportunities the reduced demand in those would have presented later this week otherwise, particularly with the first Weekend League of December upon us."

After a few weeks of slim pickings for the Unpredictables series, we have a bumper edition for TOTW 22 with an entire starting 11 missing from our predictions, including some really nice IFs for you guys to go after. Rest assured Aaron will be disciplined. 
Firmino – ST – Liverpool
Liverpool took on their feeder team on Sunday afternoon and as you would expect they did the business against Southampton at St Mary’s. Mo Salah Scored (again) as did his partner in crime Firmino who also provided an assist. Liverpool look imperious going forwards so expect more IFs in the coming weeks. 
Aaron's View: I personally didn’t feel a goal and an assist would be enough for Firmino to pick up his third special item of FUT 18,  but with Liverpool’s form as good as it is, that may have helped his cause.
Parejo – CM – Valencia
Valencia finally picked up three points on Sunday after three straight losses in La Liga and it was Levante who were put to the sword 3-1 at the Mestalla. Both Mina and Parejo had a goal and an assist in this one, but Parejo snags his SIF for 92% pass completion and an all-around great performance. 
Aaron's View: Mina picked up the MOTM award with a goal and an assist, but unlike Firmino, EA decided that wasn’t enough and instead selected the higher rated Parejo in midfield.
Federico Bernardeschi – RM – Juventus
Napoli and Juventus are locked in a battle of consecutive wins in Serie A and on Friday night Juventus extended theirs by despatching Fiorentina comfortably 2-0. One of those goals was a freekick from Bernardeschi, but with just the single strike this SIF is likely a result of general good form with Bernardeschi notching one goal and three assists in his previous four matches. 
Aaron's View: Yet another midfielder with one goal and an average match rating. All I can think is the OTW bias kicking in for EA this week.
William Carvalho – CDM – Sporting Lisbon
William Carvalho has been on the verge of leaving Sporting Lisbon for as long as I can remember, and he put in another eye-catching display on the weekend as Sporting beat Feirense 2-0. Carvalho had four shots in total and scored the crucial goal in the 77th minute to open up the tie before Freddy Montero sealed the win in extra time. 
Aaron's View: The same as above applies to Carvalho, but instead of OTW bias it’s PTG.
Nicolas Tagliafico – LB – Ajax
With two Eredivisie games in contention for TOTW 22, free scoring Ajax were always likely to pick-up and IF or two but oddly EA have chosen full back Tagliafico. He picked up two assists in Wednesday’s 4-2 win against Roda, but then didn’t produce much at all against Twente on Saturday. That said, two assists always put defenders in with a shout so perhaps this isn’t that odd.
Aaron's View: Tagliafico picked up two assists in a 4-2 win but seeing as he wasn’t in the top five players of the week or the Ajax MOTM it put me off, OTW bias again, but actually a fair choice in the end.
Jan Vertonghen – CB – Spurs
There were times in the North London Derby where Spurs looked like they could score at will, but with just the one strike from Harry Kane hitting the back of the net, Arsenal came mighty close to sneaking a draw but for some wayward finishing. Vertonghen was a rock at the back as always for Spurs with 9 clearances, great distribution, great hair and a clean sheet. 
Aaron's View: I felt a Spurs player would be forced in to the TOTW after they beat Arsenal so I went for Ben Davies who picked up an assist. For whatever reason Vertonghen made the cut instead.
Andrej Kramaric – ST – Hoffenheim
Hoffenheim have steadied this ship in the Bundesliga after their winless run and are now positioned well heading in to the end of season race for European football. Hoffenheim beat Mainz 4-2 in the Bundesliga where Kramaric popped up with two goals as did his team mate Szalai, but the ex-Leicester City forward grabs the glory and an impressive looking SIF. 
Aaron's View: *Another choice that really shouldn’t be in is Kramaric, because team mate Szalai did exactly the same in terms of goals but also picked up the MOTM award as well. Once again Kramaric gets in seemingly for the higher rating. *
Florian Lejeune – CB – Newcastle United
A defensive IF from Newcastle’s excellent win against Man United was always likely and it ended up being a straight shootout between the two centre halves Lejeune and Lascelles who were both outstanding. However, it looks as if captain Lejeune’s eye-catching clearance off the line from Martial has given him the edge in this battle.

Aaron's View: It was a big win for Newcastle against Man United and there was always a chance of an IF as a result, but who that was going to be was guesswork due to the Dubrovnik not being in FUT 18.
Benjamin Lecomte – GK – Monepellier
Montpellier grabbed their second win in a row on the Weekend against Metz in a tight 1-0 win. And they were made to work for those three points with Metz dominating much of the possession. Lecomte was the hero of the hour making 7 saves to maintain that all-important clean sheet and secure his FUT 18 SIF. 
Aaron's View: Another player I could have predicted as Lecomte picked up a 7 from L’Equipe for his clean sheet, but I felt Guaita would have picked up he IF for Getafe’s shock result against Barca.
Raul – CB – Braga
Braga are doing their very best to secure European football early this season where they now hold a ten-point advantage over 5th place Rio Ave. The latest of those points came in their 3-1 win against Vitoria de Setubal. Raul scored one and was taken down for the penalty which Paulinho then scored. No clean sheet for the big man, but still enough action for the IF. 
Aaron's View: Raul may have scored but with him conceding as well there were better options in my opinion. In terms of the Portuguese league surely Cervi with two goals was ahead of both Carvalho and Raul?
Edson Puch – LM – Querétaro
Querétaro currently find themselves in the bottom three of the Liga MX but with two draws and one win in their last three matches, it isn’t all doom and gloom. And it’s that win I mentioned which gets Edson Puch in to the TOTW as he scored both of the goals in their 2-0 win against Tijuana. 
Aaron's View: Two goals from Puch however both of the sources I use for the Liga MX had him listed at striker which put me off."

A week ago, we found out FIFA Mobile Season 2 was coming and that we'd be experiencing a reset of squads from the first year of the game. Today we get our first details on the new game.
Anyone familiar with EA's latest Madden Mobile offering is already more than versed in ""Training"", a feature which lets you feed in lower rated (think bronze, silver, and discard golds) player items into your better players to upgrade their stats. The new season of FIFA Mobile will give you the opportunity to do the same in FIFA.
Every player, whether Bronze, Silver, Gold, Elite, or the new tier, Master, will have he ability to be upgraded using other players and training points, similar to the XP we've been teased in 'PreSeason'. Per an EA release, completing the 100 overall plans for Jan Oblak, Fernando Torres, Patrice Evra, and Xherdan Shaqiri will all help you get ingredients to expedite Training when the new season goes live.
In another exciting development, 'Campaigns', a new way to experience single player FIFA Mobile was unveiled. Think Live Events but interconnected with one another and better than ever. You'll be able to make your way through ""Chapters"" in unique campaigns to unlock both players and other rewards. EA confirmed 'PreSeason' Eden Hazard (whom many of you have already completed), Paul Pogba, Serge Aurier, Javier Mascherano, and Daniele De Rossi's plans all give you ammunition to help progress through Campaigns in S2 even quicker. 
Here's a look at a sample progression through a Campaign:


So what do you think about the new developments in FIFA Mobile? Hyped for Season 2 yet?"

A couple questionable inclusion from EA in the latest Marquee Matchups, but hey, at least they’re consistently inconsistent. All joking aside, the Marquee Matchup SBC is still something to look forward to, and plan accordingly for investors. Last year, it was around this point in time that EA rolled out the Guaranteed TOTW pack as a reward, so keep that in mind. 
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
AC Milan vs Inter Milan
Match Info:  The Milan Derby kicks off a really strong week of Marquee Matchups predictions. An extremely high profile match should be a great game to watch in real life too. Set aside the time to tune in, and also look for some gold non-rare investments. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Porto vs Sporting 
Match Info:  We keep the big derbies going with this matchup between these Portuguese giants. Liga Nos featured just a couple weeks back, so there is always a little doubt. Yet, it would be tough for EA to ignore this fixture making non-rare golds on these teams rather valuable.  

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 rated


Player Requirement: 2 to 3 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Chelsea vs Manchester City
Match Info:  Manchester City has two matches within this cycle that could feature (a game versus Arsenal on that Tuesday). We went with the game against Chelsea considering its a top four clash with more at stake. EA have been a little finicky with PL inclusions lately, so selling into the hype could be a good move here.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Vancouver Whitecaps vs Montreal Impact
Match Info: Major League Soccer kicks off its season during this cycle, and the matchup that highlights the fixture list is a big time rivalry from these Canadian teams. Could be a fun addition from EA. Look for the highest non-rares you can find.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 70 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there tends to be some variance each week, let's take a look at some more outside the box picks that could make their way in:
Lokomotiv vs Spartak
Match Info:  A tough break for the Russian League as this Moskow Derby gets relegated to a sleeper pick. That being said, this match has as much a chance as any on the list, so definitely don’t sleep on this pick.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Guadalajara vs América
Match Info: Returning to North America, El Super Classico highlights Mexican matches this cycle. It’s a huge rivalry which means investors should react accordingly. Regardless of inclusion, players from these team hold their value well due to the League SBC.   

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 70 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Blackburn vs Wigan
Match Info: England's third tier has a promotion race that is heating up! These two sides sit in first and third, and only separated by a few points. It is totally a marquee match, but it's up to EA to make the final decision. Selling into hype might be the best bet here.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 70 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Legia vs Lech Poznan
Match Info: Alright, we have another Polish tie with the credential to make the SBC. Seems like there has been one each of the past four weeks. There are a lot of big matches this week, so if you’re investing here make sure to take the profit. 

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 68 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
Honestly, our selections for this week’s deep sleepers could easily be sleeper picks any other week. Don’t sleep on them, or I mean if you’re tired, go ahead. 
Midtjylland vs Brondby
Recap
If you're new to Marquee Matchup investing take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team. 
With plenty of big games to choose from we would love to hear your pick below! Also, feel free to share your thoughts on any games we missed."

FIFA 18's seventh major title update is here for PC and expected soon for Xbox One and PS4. Let's start as we do with just about all of these lately before we go any further:
Just because something you want changed wasn't in this particular release doesn't mean EA isn't aware of it or that it necessarily will never be addressed. FIFA's current iterative release cycle means the majority of changes deployed are done so in the order they are finalized and finished. Rest assured there will be more changes and more patches to come over the life of the game.
That said, let's talk about what's different in this latest release. Gameplay seems completely unchanged and the focuses by and large are on presentation/polish/navigation, and perhaps most importantly, accessibility.
One of the biggest focuses this go around is a new Accessibility Settings screen, a way to help FIFA reach and be accessible by more gamers than ever before. People with disabilities and the non-disabled alike should have every ability to enjoy their football. While there's certainly still a long way to go, EA's points of emphasis on these fronts in the FIFA and Madden franches are frankly overdue and very welcome.
The FIFA team also mentions in the release notes a resolution to an issue where in which navigating ""Pressing the D-pad, when using a controller, would occasionally not register."" Some are interpreting this to mean a resolution to all menu lag, which may be a bit naive if not premature. PC menus already navigated far smoother than its console counterparts, and that language could simply refer to a specific situation where input lag was taking place, not necessarily a broader improvement to all menu navigational lag. We'll have to wait and see what PC players say about this specific change.
From a presentation stand point, the release notes adds ""Updates to the 2D portraits for 970 players"" as well as ""Added 2d portraits for 342 players that previously had a silhouette."" Clearly not game-changing, but a nice touch for those hoping to keep the in-game experience fresh after nearly five months of the game being out.
Title Update 7 surely isn't going to win hearts and minds amongst the more cynical social media crowds, but the (admittedly minor) tweaks by and large seem welcome. You can see the complete release notes below:

Hey FIFA Fans,

The latest title update for FIFA 18 is now available on PC.

This update includes the following:

Made the following changes to settings:
- The addition of an Accessibility Settings screen.
- This is available in the Main Menu on the Customize tab by selecting the Settings tile.
- This adds the following new settings:
  -- The ability for players to remove the need to use the right stick within the game menus, allowing for navigation with the left stick only when using a controller.
  -- The ability for players to remove the need to use the left and right trigger / left and right bumper buttons within the game menus, allowing for players to scroll up to the top of the menu and cycle through them with the left stick when using a controller.
     --- This change will impact the Game Settings and Controller Settings screens only.
   -- The ability to add an on-screen, and clickable, ESC button during gameplay to allow for opening the Pause Menu using the mouse only.
   -- The ability to increase the size of the clickable buttons within the game menus when using a mouse.

Addressed the following issues in all screens:
 - Pressing the D-pad, when using a controller, would occasionally not register.

Made the following changes in FIFA Ultimate team:
  - In FUT Champions Weekend League, on the Match Preview screen, you will no longer see the status of your opponent update between ""Making Changes"" and ""Ready"", it will always display as ""Making Changes"".
    -- There is a known issue with this change that sometimes results in the status for your opponent showing as blank, it will be addressed in a future update.
  - Selecting the difficulty of a match in FUT Squad Battles will no longer cause the player's default match difficulty setting outside of FUT Squad Battles to be changed.
  - In the preview panel for a FUT Champions Channel replay, the match records displayed for the participating players will now reflect their record when that match took place instead of their current record.

Addressed the following issues in FIFA Ultimate team:
- German and Polish text overlapping the button icons on the controls panel in FUT Champions Channel.
- Player Contracts and Manager Contracts were incorrectly capitalized in the search filter options of the FUT Transfer Market.
Made the following changes in Audio / Visual / Presentation:
- Updates to the 2D portraits for 970 players.
- Added 2d portraits for 342 players that previously had a silhouette.

Addressed the following issues in Audio / Visual / Presentation:
- Post goal commentary saying that a defender deflected the ball on goal, when it was actually the keeper that touched the ball before it went into the net, when using Arabic, German, Dutch, Spanish, French, Italian, Mexican Spanish, Polish, Russian or Japanese commentary.

Thanks to those who’ve provided feedback. Throughout the course of the FIFA 18 season we'll provide you with more information and updates if and when they become available.

FIFA 18 is still a work week from its full retail release, but the world's gaming press have begun to provide their own opinion on how this year's football game from EA is shaping up. 
Worth noting: Some of these are classified as ""Reviews in progress"".
Bleacher Report (Score: 9/10)
""FIFA 18 is a well-rounded package, crammed with subtle tweaks that will force players to improve their game by finding an identity. EA Sports' juggernaut is truly rolling, but as ever, months of play will define whether these changes really deliver. ""
Eurogamer (Score: Recommended) 
""If you're anything like me, though, you'll get a lot out of this hyper cleaned up version of FIFA 17. Like Spurs, FIFA 18 plays a fantastic game of football. But like Spurs, FIFA 18 probably won't win any trophies.""
GameInformer (Score: 8.8/10)
""On the pitch, FIFA 18's gameplay shows as many strides forward as it does legacy issues. I like how it feels to run and dribble with the left analog stick, with easy, minute changes of direction letting you move into open spaces. Overall, the game seems more wide open than some previous FIFAs, which more strictly governed how you moved up the pitch.""
Gamespot (Score: 7/10) 
""It's off the pitch that EA excels. From the variety of game modes on offer and how everything's presented, to the constant updates in FUT's Team of the Week, Daily Objectives, and discussion of real-world happenings in commentary, FIFA 18 captures the world of football and confidently translates it into a video game""
The Telegraph (Score: In Progress)
""FIFA 18 is a significantly better football game than its predecessor.""
Trusted Reviews (Score: 4.5/5) 
""FIFA 18 is simply magnificent. Streets ahead of what came before, and continuing its dominance over its rivals, EA has done a superb job. With huge improvements across the board, this is the game FIFA fans have waited five years for.""
Forbes (Score: N/A)
""By accentuating its prior positives and offering real and tangible improvements to gameplay, FIFA 18 excels and is slightly better than last year's solid entry.""
Four Four Two (Score: 4.5/5)
The biggest game on the planet improves markedly in every key area. FIFA fans will adore it. PES die-hards: well, be grateful that your beloved is a beauty too.
IGN (Score: 8/10 In Progress)
""Ultimately, FIFA 18 introduces enough new ideas to suggest it’s not sitting on the laurels of its success. However, it’s a simplified experience, one that fails to embrace the complexity of football at the highest level.""*
Daily Mirror (Score: 5/5)
""All the modes have been given some treatment and it's great to see EA have fleshed out the Journey a bit more. For those of us wanting a story-led single-player experience, FIFA 18 definitely delivers.""
Daily Mail (Score: N/A)
""FIFA 18 is the best football game on the market, hands down. They have done it again.""
But of course, those of you with EA Acess (or early copies) will already have experienced FIFA 18 for yourselves. So hit us up in the comments with yout initial thoughts. FIFA 18's Metacritic is currently sat at a very healthy 84."

You've probably already seen them making the rounds on social media.
Both those who got an extremely early start with EA Access on Xbox One and the rest of us who got into the web app but haven't been able to play the game yet were able to complete the ""Let's Get Started"" Squad Building Challenge in FIFA Ultimate Team to claim either an Xbox or a PlayStation kit, depending on which console you play on.
But when you get those, they're represented in the web app by a shadow of a shirt.
If you haven't had a chance to equip them and see them in game yet or maybe you're just curious about what they'll look like but don't want to get away from your starter kit yet, you're in luck.

For a third straight year, EA is heading to Los Angeles. Yet again skirting the space and timing restrictions of participating in the industry-wide E3, Electronic Arts will be unveiling their 2018 library in presentations expected to include ""FIFA 19"" in their own event from June 9-11, 2018 once again at the Hollywood Palladium. 
The confirmed times for the three-day affair is Saturday, 9 June, from 2 p.m. - 8 p.m. Pacific (10 p.m. - 4 a.m. UK) and then Sunday and Monday the 10th and 11th from 10 a.m. - 8 p.m. Pacific (6 p.m. - 4 a.m. UK). The presentations will be streaming online.
Though FIFA isn't particularly called out in any of the company's announcements, they did mention the ability to check out ""new EA SPORTS™ games"" and the title's featured prominently in each of the last two editions of the event. 
Last year's FIFA presentation, after a week of announcements which included Icons coming to all consoles and Ronaldinho (re-)joining the game, left some players with a little to be desired.

If you were one of those hoping for a Nicklas Bendtner -- perhaps better known in the FIFA community as ""Lord B"" -- purple-and-gold overpowered Squad Buildling Challenge player item, you're stuck waiting at least another year. 
Despite leading the Norwegian Eliteserien in goals scored with 19, the former Arsenal man was snubbed in favor of teammate Tore Reginiussen. Reginiussen follows in the footsteps of teammate (and club captain) Mike Jensen, who a year ago became a Weekend League super-sub after being honored with his own Norwegian POTY honors.
Reginiussen's Squad Buillding Challenge redeemable special item is available now until Monday, December 4. The ratings look promising, but as a Norway player from Norway's top league, it's going to be awfully hard to get him in your squad if you aren't heavy in either of those departments.
If you do wind up completing the SBC, let us know how he is in the comments below."

Hello everyone!

For those who already know me, my guide was originally posted on /r/FIFA, and as you know had some readability problems.

Thankfully, Futhead kindly offered the possibility to post the guide for the community, so we could work on it, make it easier to read, and keep it updated it throughout the year! 
For those who followed this guide from the beginning, especially when It was first posted on the great /r/FIFA, thank you so much for your support! This would not be possible for all of us in the community without you.
This is a guide I made for players who want to create a squad in Ultimate Team built around ""Calcio A"" league, aka the Italian first division.
In this guide I will show you the players you should be aiming to get in every price range you might be, and also a brief analysis of each one of them. You will never have to ask for advice for Calcio A teams again :) 

Keep in mind that this guide is a SUGGESTION. Don't expect it to make you win every single game; this is just squad building advice. 
The guide is organized by collapsed tables, you can press the buttons below to see players from specific positions, along with my reasoning on why you should pick them. 




A few quick notes about this guide:

-- Player prices are based on PS4.
-- All players listed have a Futhead link to their player page, where you can check stats/prices/chemistry effect and also have a button that redirects you to the transfer market in the web app, so you can buy the player immediately if you wish to do so!
-- All position/stat abbreviations are in English. For example: ST-Striker, CB-Center Back, DRI-Dribble.
-- Nationalities, formation and loyalty are not taken into account. If you do a team with all players from the same league, you will get 100 chemistry anyway.

-- Chemistry Styles are very important. If a player has the basic chemistry style, 10 individual chemistry and your team chemistry is 100, he will get a small increase in every stat. However, by changing the chemistry type, you can distribute those stat increases in different ways. Here's a list on every single one of them, just scroll down a bit.
-- Work rates are also really important in high-level squad building. If you don't know what those are, it basically describes the effort your player puts into attacking and defending. For example, a midfielder with ""High/High"" work rates will constantly move into attacking and defending, but will get tired faster than a midfielder with ""Mid/Mid"" work rates.
Alright, on with the guide:
 
 
CALCIO A PRICE RANGES


These are the ranges that best describe the player base of FIFA Ultimate in my opinion. Feel free to correct me/leave feedback in the comments below!


TierPrice Range Target Player base
Low Cost2k-For new players who just want to start building a cheap Calcio A squad with 100 chemistry. 
Low-Average Cost2k~10kFor players who want to improve their cheap squad with better and slightly more expensive options. 
Average Cost10k~40kFor players who want to achieve a strong 5* squad. 
High-Average Cost40k~100kor player who want to start building a very high-overall squad. 
High Cost100k~200kFor players who have reached a point where the only way they can upgrade is by buying the most expensive players available. 
Luxury200k+For players with no budget ceeling. Having these players is indeed a luxury. Informs with small stat upgrades go in here as well.

Inform Immobile and IcardiNice upgrades to both of them. Belloti is still the strongest of the 3 by far, however his speed is no longer relevant after the upgrades, so now they are better than him. Immobile is faster and the better dribbler, Icardi is more dominant in the air (90 heading and 94 jumping), and the better shooter. They are both looking very complete with the Hawk chemistry Same as beforeHawkFinisher/Hunter
HiguainDefinitely the most complete striker in the league if you buff his speed. Lacks 4* skills and has low Balance.Positioning, Finishing, Shotpower, Volleys, Dribbling in general, Heading, StrengthHawk for great all-around boostHunter for achieving 91 pace
MertensThis guy has it all. Pace of a winger, passing of a CF, shooting of a Striker and insane dribbling. Also 4* skills and Weak foot. Only downside is that he is weak and has 35 heading, so forget about crossing play. Everything except physicalHunter for 98 paceSniper for 97 Dribbling

NiangOnly reason I'm putting him on the list is because this guy has 99 pace with Hunter chem and costs less than 1k. So if you enjoy playing FIFA like it's a racing game, feel free to use him. Just keep in mind that Nani offers much more for only slightly more coins.Pace, ShotPower, Dribbling, StrengthHunter-----

Scream PerisicGreat position change, this makes him and incredible card because he is now a CAM with the speed, shooting and dribbling of a Winger, paired up with his already great height, strength, stamina, and 4* SM and 5* WF. Only problem is that, being a winger, he has much worse passing than the other CAMs, so improving it with chem will be important Pace, Shooting, Dribbling, Strength, Stamina MaestroFinisher

Milinkovic-SavicA strong and tall midfielder with great heading and jumping. However, you have to boost his speed and passing. If you do so, he is a very good player for his price. BallControl, Dribbling, Heading, Jumping, Strength, StaminaEngineCatalyst
Brozovic, ParoloGood cheap options that complement each other. Brozovic has the better speed, passing and dribble, Parolo is better at defending and long shots.Passing, Dribbling, Shooting, DefendingBoth: EngineBoth: Maestro
JorginhoA very good alternative to Brozovic, since he is faster, a better defender and has better passing. However, Brozovic is better for taking shots on goal and is stronger, so pick whichever suits your play style. Passing, BallControl, Stamina EnginePowerhouse
Joao Mario, BonaventuraUpgrade from the previous duo. Better passing, dribbling and stamina ShotPower, LongShots, Vision, Crossing, SPassing, LPassing, Dribbling in generalBoth: MaestroBoth: Engine
StrootmanThis man has very good passing, ball controll, shot power, defending, and a monster physique for such a cheap CM. You will notice his effect in the game immediately thanks to the H/H work rates and good stamina. Really good with Maestro. ShotPower, Vision, SPassing, LPassing, BallControl, Interceptions, Standing Tackle, Physical MaestroBackbone
PjanicThe first of the CM big boys in this league. Good speed, very good passing and dribbling, and 91 freekick. That means Maestro puts him at 99 freekick. Sounds amazing right? The M/M work rates work really good with him because it makes him stay central in the field, and that's where he really shines. Double 4*. LongShots, Vision, Freekicks, SPassing, LPassing, Curve, BallControl, Dribbling MaestroEngine
MarchisioThe better defender/worse dribbler version of Pjanic. H/H work rates paired with good speed, great passing and good defending. Physical is not that bad either, and has better shooting that Pjanic. Another Double 4*. Speed, ShotPower, LongShots, Vision, SPassing, LPassing, Dribbling in general, Interceptions, Sliding Tackle, good Stamina. MaestroPowerhouse
NainggolanProbably one of the most complete players in the entire game. In relation to Pjanic and Marchisio, this guy is faster, shoots better, defends better, is stronger, has 94 stamina, and has just slightly worse dribbling and passing. To put it in perspective, Pjanic has 2130 total stats, this guy has 2231! Everything except Heading, he sucks at it. MaestroAnything, this guy can play anyway you like

De RossiI really don't understand how this guy is so cheap. He has good passing, good defending and good physical. Problem is that he's slow and has low dribbling, but Chemistry fixes that.ShotPower, Passing, Defending, PhysicalAnchorPowerhouse

MatuidiOk, play close attention now: 78 pace, 82 defending, 84 physical, 94 stamina, H/H work rates. You got all that?

MirandaFast with very good defender, and good passing for a CB. However, stamina is not very high, and is overpriced for having 86 overall and being brazilian. SprintSpeed, Defending in general, Jumping, Strength, AgressionAnchorShadow
BonucciThis guy might seem slightly worse than the others at first glance because of the worse pace and defending, but here's the thing: this guy has 85 long passing. Yeah, and he's a CB. Also, his defense is really high, and he has 88 heading. Anchor will boost him through the roof. Passing, Defending, PhysicalAnchorSentinel
Benatia A good inform that made him slightly faster and stronger, with a great improvement in passing and better defending. Has 91 strength now! Very good with anchor.Pace, Passing, Defending, PhysicalAnchor-----
ChielliniOk so...this guy's defence is so high, that you actually end up wasting a lot of chemistry stats by buffing his defence. I know right? He has 92 Marking and StandTackle, 90 SlideTackle, 91 Strength, 92 Agression and 89 Jumping, so you can either anchor him up anyway, or actually go for catalyst for a nice buff in pace and passing.

LukakuVery fast, strong and good defence, he is one of the hidden gems in the league. Just don't expect him to be useful on anything else besides defending. He achieves 99 strength with the sentinel card. Pace, PhysicalSentinelAnchor
Radu, Ghoulam, RodriguezOk, basically it goes this way: Radu if you want a LB that stays back to defend, Ghoulam if you want someone to run the wing all day long, Rodriguez if you want a LB that can pass and cross really well and still defend decently.By order: Defending, Pace, PassingAnchorShadow
Inform Kolarov Great inform. Major increases in all areas. He has 99 shot power and 88 longshots which is insane! Also 92 crossing, 85 heading with great height, good defence and 89 aggression. Very solid card. However, he is still a bit slow, which sadly forces him into shadowShotpower, Crossing, Defending, Heading, AgressionShadowAnchor

Donnaruma88 diving and 88 reflexes means he has almost as much diving as Buffon, and more reflexes than Handanovic. It's a shame that he has such low stats on everything else. But he will for sure make great saves. Also, he's 196cm tall Diving, Reflexes, HeightGloveCat
PerinThis guy is just too good for 1k. And 90 reflexes? Yes pleaseReflexes, SpeedGloveCat
Handanovic Very good all-around goalkeeper for a fair price. Diving, Handling, Reflexes, PositioningGloveCat
IF2 SiriguHe is very similar to Handanovic in terms of defence stats, but sacrifices a little bit of handling, positioning and reflexes in exchange for more kicking and speed. EverythingGloveCat
BuffonDude, it's Buffon. But if that isn't reason enough, he is a ""classic goalkeeper"" with very high Diving, Handling and Positioning stats. Great saves will come, and if you are unhappy with his reflexes, you can always buff them with Cat chemistry. Diving, Handling, PositioningGloveCat
IF HandanovicBest goalkeeper in the league. Why? Because he has very high stats in every aspect. He is basically Buffon but with much better speed and reflexes.Everything except kickingGloveCat


 
 
Honourable Mentions:
 
List


NameWhy shouldn't I pick them?
Franck KessieAlthough he is fast and strong for a CM, that's about it. He is lacking in the passing and dribbling capabilities, and the defending isn't that high to justify using him.
KarsdorpHe is a very fast RB indeed, but if you are in for the speed just go for Cancelo, as he offers much more offensive capabilities, and is actually faster.
AbateSame reasoning as Karsdorp. If you are going for speed, just pick Cancelo with Sentinel chem.
DalbertAnother very fast defender. However, Lukaku is just as fast as him, but much stronger.
ZielinskiAlthough he is faster than the average midfielder, he isn’t really good at anything else. If he was a good dribbler then it could justify him being bought, but he isn't, and is also weaker compared to the other CMs.
Simone VerdiHe is fast and has good dribbling, but he has such gigantic flaws in his shooting and strength that you would never prefer him over Anderson
DefrelA fast and cheap striker, but not much faster than Eder, and he's worse at everything else.
BigliaHe has better passing than De-Rossi, but is weaker and worse at defending, wich is why I think De Rossi will work better as a cheap CDM.
SzczesnyAnother goalkeeper with high reflexes, but if you are going to pick him for that, then Perin seems better overall in my opinion.
BernardeschiAlthough he is indeed a good winger, he simply doesn't have the extreme stats of other players because he is ""too balanced"". What I mean by this is that if you want either a Runner, a Crosser, a Shooter or a Dribbler, all the other wingers represent better specialized options. Maybe if he gets an inform he will be worth picking up, but for now I recommend sticking to the other players.
De VrijHe is a good and strong defender, however, Tonelli with Sentinel chem is actually better, because De Vrij is forced to use Anchor/Shadow chem due to being slow, which means Tonelli ends up with higher defence and strength.
HowedesExactly same reason. Howedes is forced into Anchor/Shadow for being slow, while my other 2 options aren't, ultimately making them better defenders.
AstoriAnother cheap defender outclassed by Tonelli.
IF TorreiraToo expensive at the moment to justify using him, especially when the likes of Pjanic and Marchisio aren't too far from his price.
TOTGS FreulerA huge improvement over the original, but that's about it. 10k for a 81 rated card is something you shouldn't be aiming for.
IF De VrijVery high defensive stats and good strength, but Manolas is a better defender with sentinel chem, and costs 30k less.
IF FerrariHis pace stat is very odd. 81 acceleration, but only 42 sprint speed? Also, Koulibaly is better than this card.
IF BrignoliPerin is better than him and costs 10k less. Don't use this card.


 
 
Recommended Formations:
 
List


FormationWhy should I pick it?
4-1-2-1-2 (2)Narrow formation that fully utilizes the strong midfield capability Calcio A has to offer. Strong all-around strikers followed by a good CAM, standing in front of a very strong and well established midfield, which plenty of wing space to let your LB/RB explore the deepness of the pitch. Wouldn't advise you to pick the normal 4-1-2-1-2, as it uses wingers instead of CMs and the wingers in this league are very offensive, you will probably feel a lack of defensive capabilities on your central sector.
4-3-1-2Same as above, except in this tactic you have 3 CMs instead of 2 CMs and 1 CDM. Might be better for you if you want to bring less defensive focused midfielders up front.
4-2-3-1 (2)Perfect tactic if you want to balance your usage of the wings with the midfield emphasis. You sacrifice 1 midfielder and 1 striker to bring in 2 wingers. And don't be fooled by the 2 CDMs, you can always place a normal CM in one of those positions and instruct him to come forward during attacks. That way you will have plenty of space to work with, with 1 striker, 2 wingers and 2 midfielders in the offense, while your CDM and defenders stay at the back, occasionally letting a LB/RB come forward for creative play.
4-3-3 (2)Standard 4-3-3 with 1 CDM, 2 CMs, 2 Wingers and 1 Striker. Perfect for utilizing the speed and creativity that Calcio A's wingers have to offer, like Cuadrado and Insigne.
4-3-3 (4)A more offensive 4-3-3 option, since it disregards the CDM and brings a CAM into play. Attacking will be easier, defending will be harder.
4-2-2-2A 4-1-2-1-2 variation where you turn your 2 CMs into 1 CAM and 1 CDM. Might be better if you want to utilize more than 1 good CAM at the same time, but bringing the ball forward through passing might be a problem since your midfielders are so far apart.


 
 
Possible Questions:
Why is Hamsik better at CAM rather than CM?

80 SHOT + 84 DRIB + 5* WF, but only 68 DEF + 70 PHY. He is too good at attacking and too mediocre at defending compared to other CM.

Pjanic is also a ""not so great"" defender, why isn't he also better at CAM?

Hamsik has much more positioning and finishing that Pjanic, and stronger shot power, while Pjanic is only good at long shoots really, and is better for short/long passing and progressing through the midfield.

Why is Inform Pjanic better at CM rather than CDM?

Because he should never have received an Inform card for CDM, just look at his stats! The man has 89 PAS and 87 DRIB but only 68 DEF and 70 PHY, why would you put such a player so far back on the pitch?;

Where is [your favourite player]?! How could you not include him in this guide?! Man this guide sucks!

This guide was created with deep studying of the players available in the League, and with community feedback. If the player you are looking for isn't either listed or honourable mentioned, then probably he isn't that good to begin with, I'm sorry to disappoint you :/

Scream Khedira also has a small stat upgrade, why isn't he in the Luxury Tier like IF Matuidi?

Because he is in the same price range as normal Matuidi, and they are very different players in terms of playstyle. Also he doesn't have an absurd price increase like IF Matuidi.

People often say that Higuain is a bad striker, is there a reason for that?

After looking into this question, the conclusion that came by is that players like Higuain and Immobile feel ""bad"" because they have a low balance stat, which makes them struggle when pressured by defenders. A suggested fix for this is to use a chemistry card that increases balance, like Engine for example. If you are unhappy with these players, try to improve their balance and see if it helps.

 
FINAL THOUGHTS ON CALCIO A
 

Calcio A is a good league to start, with strong players at a low cost (-2k)
It's a great league for premium players (100k~500k), especially in the defence and midfield.
However, it's lacking the really good players for the Wing positions, as well as right back.
It's not very forgiving in terms of composition either, since most of the great players reside in the midfield. The player might be forced to use narrow tactics to make use of said midfielders. 
Overall, I recommend this league for players that enjoy very strong defence and tactics focused around ball possession with strong offensive midfielders.

After a few weeks with some odd results, it was back to a solid week of 3/4 correct predictions last week. 
With 2 of this week's fixtures being played on Friday night, we will possibly be able to see the team sheets before the deadline for picking your result, which may give a slight advantage over those games later in the weekend.
So, let’s get down to business.

Napoli vs Juventus
In a bit of a role reversal from last season, first place Napoli are four points ahead of third place Juventus as the two sides meet in Naples in what will certainly be a very good game. 
Hosts Napoli are in fine form, winning their last three games in all competitions, and have only lost to Manchester City in the Champions League in their past 10 home games. With just two points dropped in their last five games and still unbeaten in the league this season, they come into this game in great form and looking to extend their lead at the top of the table over both Inter Milan and Juventus.
Meanwhile, Juventus are in fairly average away form, with four wins and three losses in their last 10 away games. With two losses in the league, they are somewhat slacking down in third place in the league, but a win will see them jump back to up within touching distance to the top of the table.
Juventus have been the victors in 3 of the previous 5 fixtures between the two sides, but with Napoli being the more in form side, it makes this a very tough one to call. 
Game time: Friday 1st December, 7:45 p.m. (GMT) / 2:45 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw 

Porto vs Benfica
Any game between the big three sides in Portugal is a big one, especially when it’s between the two most successful in recent years. Similar to Napoli v Juventus, the game takes place on Friday night and sees first place host third, with Porto sitting just three points ahead of their opponents. 
Porto come into the game off of the back of a very disappointing 0-0 draw against 15th placed Aves, which saw them drop points for just the second time this season. Even with the most goals scored and fewest conceded, they are still just two points clear at the top of the table.
Meanwhile, Benfica come into the game with 13 goals in their last 4 league games, and a 6-0 thrashing of Setubal last weekend. Their slow start to the season saw them drop 7 points out of their first 12 available away from home, but they have recovered from that and haven’t dropped a point in two months. 
Three of the past five counters between the sides have ended in draws, with Porto winning the other two by a single goal margin., and you need to go back almost three years to find the last time Benfica won this match - a 2-0 win in Porto.
Game time: Friday 1st December, 8:30 p.m. (GMT) / 3:30 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Porto win 

Hoffenheim vs RB Leipzig
Two of last seasons surprise packages face off in the Bundesliga, with second placed Leipzig hoping for a win to keep their title challenge alive, while Hoffenheim aim to get a much needed win to push them into the European qualification spots, with Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen -- the teams occupying the two places directly above them -- facing off at the same time.
After picking up just six points from their last 21 -- three of them against winless FC Koln, Hoffenheim are in dire form and in desperate need of a victory.  However, their defence just doesn’t seem to have gelled like it did last season after the loss of both Niklas Sule and Sebastian Rudy to Bayern Munich over the summer And with their main striker Sandro Wagner having scored just twice since the end of September, things are not looking good for them.
Leipzig pulled off a bit of a surprise result in the Champions League last week, as they completely tore apart Monaco in the first half. And with Dortmund in horrendous form, RBL look set to be Bayern’s main title challengers once again. With two just one loss in their last six games -- a 2-0 defeat by Bayern, Leipzig are in red hot form and are desperate to keep tabs on Bayern, while also staying ahead of Schalke and Monchengladbach who sit just two points behind them.
I can only see this game going one way, and that is with an away win.
Game time: Saturday 2nd December, 2:30 p.m. (GMT) / 9:30 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Leipzig win

Besiktas vs Galatasaray
Not many people would have thought that Besiktas would be one of the most talked about clubs during the summer transfer window, but with some big name signings and an ... interesting way of announcing them, they certainly made some headlines. They face off against Turkish giants Galatasaray in what is always an interesting game.
Besiktas are currently fifth in the table, but are tied on points with third place Fenerbahce -- Gala’s eternal rivals -- and 6 points behind their opponents. They are in some poor ever since losing to bottom of the league Genclerbirligi over a month ago. With three wins and six draws in their last nine games in all competitions, they may be undefeated but they're by no means in good form. 
The same could be said about Galatasaray, who have won two and lost two of their previous 4 league matches, including a 5-1 thrashing by second placed side Basaksehir. 
In terms of H2H results, those completely favour the hosts, who have not lost this fixture since the 2014/15 season, with three wins and two draws since then.
Game time: Saturday 2nd December, 4:30 p.m. (GMT) / 11:30 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Besiktas win

That's what I think will happen this week, which will hopefully let us get the 83 Overall ST Vincent Aboubakar. Let us know what you think will happen by commenting below or tweeting me @Darren_8196. Good luck and happy predicting!"

            Updated on
            



EA SPORTS' inaugural round of FIFA 18 Winter Upgrades, branded for a second straight year as a ""Ratings Refresh"", are finally here. 
Coming a week later than they did in FUT 17, new, tweaked ratings possessing versions of a number of players from across all Europe's top leagues (and beyond) will begin replacing the previous versions of their player items in-packs beginning today, 23 February. The previous non-inform versions of the items will not have their ratings changed, but as often is the case, there's a twist: If you own a special in-form version of a player who gets an upgrade that crosses the barrier of one of the ratings on that item, that IF/MOTM/TOTGS/etc will be upgraded accordingly.
Unlike the previous FIFA, there will not be downgrades it would appear in this year's release. At this time last year, having new, lower-rated versions of players not living up to their expectations or regressing in real life were a welcome change to the formerly-known-as-January Upgrades routine. But besides the players themselves not liking the negative publicity, it's hard to imagine partner clubs were thrilled to see mid-game-life-cycle negative tweaks to their players' items. They understandably also weren't particularly popular in-game with gamers.
While the market typically reflects a need to sell into the hype on promos like these, there may still be some opportunities for investment wins amongst in-forms yet to come. Stay tuned from now through the next week as there'll be plenty of upgrades to come.
You can see all the upgrades (including to in-forms) over the course of the next week at Futhead's ""Ratings Refresh"" hub.

Hoffenheim’s shock 4-0 thrashing of RB Leipzig just about sums up last week, as we slumped to just 1/4 correct after Porto being held to a draw by Benfica and Juventus getting a  narrow win over Napoli in games that were very close to call.
Let’s hope this week is a bit more promising, as we have some big games to predict, and with an 84-Overall LWB Ashley Young on offer, he’ll make a perfect partner for the Weekend Tournament Antonio Valencia from a couple of weeks ago, given you manage to get all four of these results correct of course. 
Manchester United v Manchester City
I know my prediction will cause some fans to get upset either way, but it was always going to either way.
Both teams come into the game in fine form, having both fielded much weakened teams in their final Champions League group fixture, and are in fine form in the league, which makes this a very interesting game.
United were very close to City in the table until 8 dropped points in 4 games saw them drop back, but they haven’t dropped points in the league in over a month, so will be high on confidence going into the game. With De Gea’s performances recently increasing his claim for the title of best keeper in the world, and goals coming from a wide variety of places in recent games, they are in the type of form any team wants to be in to play their rivals.
City have only won one game against their neighbours since 2014, but with their excellent form of late which has seen them go unbeaten this season up until Wednesday night where their weakened team fell to a 2-1 loss away to Shakhtar Donetsk. However, I highly doubt that will affect them this weekend, when they will be back at full strength and well rested for the biggest game of the weekend.
I have a feeling City will slightly edge this game, perhaps 2-1, but it’s such a close call that it makes it a very tough game to predict.
Game time: Sunday 10th December, 4:30 p.m. (GMT) / 11:30 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Manchester City win 

Toronto FC v Seattle Sounders
The MLS Cup Final marks the end of the season in North America, which sees a battle of Canada v USA in the form of Toronto v Seattle in a rematch of last year’s final.
Seattle came away as winners last time round thanks to a 5-4 penalty shootout win, despite not having a single shot on goal in the regular 90 minutes and relying on Sebastian Frei’s amazing performance to help keep them in the game to even reach ET and penalties. They finished second in the Western Conference behind the Portland Timbers, and have gone from strength to strength in the playoffs without even conceding a goal in their 4 games so far. 
Toronto come into the game on the back of one of the best seasons in MLS history, having cruised to the top of the Eastern Conference -- 12 points ahead of their nearest rivals NYCFC. With the best defence and attack in the normal league season, however they haven’t had it all their own way in the playoffs, having had to rely on away goals to get through against NYRB in the first round, before scraping a 1-0 aggregate win over Columbus to reach the final. Altidore is recovering from a slight injury, so how fit he is remains to be seen, but with his excellent performances alongside Giovinco this season, there’s no doubt he’ll play if he can.
Toronto are big favourites this game, and with the game being played at their home stadium, I have a feeling they’ll get revenge this time round and take the title.
Note: you have to select a winner for this game, as it is decided by who wins the trophy, not the result after 90 minutes. 
Game time: Saturday 9th December, 9:00 p.m. (GMT) / 4:00 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Toronto win 

Ajax v PSV
When two Dutch giants play each other, it's always a big occasion. Ajax may be clear favourites according to the bookies, but that may not give an accurate picture of the teams coming into the game. 
Ajax may not be the force they were back from 2010 to 2014, but they certainty shouldn't be written off. They have scored 4 or more in 7 of their 14 league games this season, making them top scorers ahead of their opponents, but have failed to make the most of their free scoring and turn it into points. Last weekend seemed to sum up their season - throwing away a 2-0 and 3-2 lead against second bottom side Twente. 
PSV are flying in the league, with their only dropped points this season being a 2-0 loss to Heerenveen a massive 3 months ago. With 41 goals in 14 games, they look like they are cruising to the league title just now, with an 8 point advantage over a surprise second place AZ Alkmaar. 
Ajax have home advantage, but that may not be enough for them to overcome their opponents from Eindhoven who are in far better form and a massive 10 points ahead of them in the league after just 14 games.
Game time: Sunday 10th December, 3:45 p.m. (GMT) / 10:45 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: PSV win 

Juventus v Inter Milan
After a narrow win over Napoli last week, Juventus have their second match in a row against the leaders of Serie A, as they face an Inter Milan side who overtook Napoli last week.
Juventus have the home advantage this time, and have only lost once there since September, conceding just 5 goals in that period as well. With Higuain, Dybala and co. getting into a proper scoring rhythm, it’s very difficult to predict anything other than a win for them. 
Inter Milan could prove to be their undoing though. No midweek European travel distractions sees them have all week to prepare for the big game, and they are in perfect form to take on Juventus. As the only unbeaten side left in Italy this season, they come into the game high on confidence after a 5-0 thrashing of Chievo last weekend. But with 2 of their draws coming away from home this season, along with a poor record that’s seen them not win away to Juventus since 2012, it could be time for that impressive run to come to an end.
Game time: Saturday 9th December, 7:45 p.m. (GMT) / 2:45 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw

That’s what I think will happen this week, with some very tough games to try and predict.

A big name Team of the Week 10 means a big name set of Unpredictables this week with some absolutely huge in-forms missed from our predictions. To go with that, there is also a severe lack of unexplainable selections, so bravo, I guess? Eight players missed this week, so let's find out why.
Mauro Icardi – ST – Inter Milan
With Juventus losing 3-2 to Sampdoria (more on that in a minute), Inter took the chance to leap frog The Old Lady by comfortably seeing off Atalanta, 2-0, at the San Siro. Star striker Mauro Icardi scored both of those goals for Inter taking him to 13 for the season in Serie A and his second FIFA 18 In Form. He just keeps on scoring. 
Aaron's View: I had some conflicting ratings from Gazzetta from my usual source, so considering Icardi only scored twice, and already had an IF, I decided to leave him out.
Paul Pogba – CDM – Manchester United
After months on the sidelines through injury, Paul Pogba returned to Old Trafford last weekend, and it was like he’d never been away. Showing little sign of rust, Pogba played with his usual swagger producing a great piece of skill to setup Anthony Martial to level the game with Newcastle in the first half. Pogba then scored himself in the second, after a sumptuous knock-down from Marcus Rashford, all of which culminated in a comfortable 4-1 win. It’s great to have him back. 
Aaron's View: It was a straight up 50/50 choice between Pogba and Coutinho this week and I simply opted for the wrong one.
Arturo Vidal – CM – Bayern Munich
Another predictable win for Bayern in the Bundesliga last weekend saw Augsburg torn apart in just 20 minutes of action with all three goals in Bayern’s 3-0 win coming in quick succession either side of half time. Arturo Vidal put in an all action performance at the Allianz scoring the opener and then assisting Lewandowski for one of his brace of goals. Vidal almost grabbed a double himself hitting the woodwork in the 50th minute. A great performance from the Chilean. 
Aaron's View: Lewandowski claimed two goals and MOTM for Bayern but try as I might, I couldn't manage to squeeze him in to my prediction this week, let alone Vidal.
Raffael – ST – Borussia Monchengladbach
Gladbach are unbeaten in three games now in the Bundesliga, with their latest win arriving courtesy of Hertha Berlin. They didn’t have it all their own way though, and after going 3-0 up inside 20 minutes, Berlin made them sweat, pulling two goals back themselves before the win was eventually secured by a late Raffael goal. That was his second of the afternoon and fourth of the season for the 32 year old. Gladback sit fourth presently in the Bundesliga. 
Aaron's View: To be honest, I never even considered Raffale for TOTW 10 as I felt there were far stonger striker/central attack options this week.
Gonzalo Castro – LM – Malaga
Malaga are still stuck in the relegation zone in La Liga, but they are making serious strides to get out of it with a second win in three matches coming against Deportivo on Sunday. Left winger Gonzalo Castro scored one and assisted the opener for Roberto Rosales in his sides 3-2 win, which Borja Baston secured in the 84th minute. Even after those wins however, Malaga are still four points from safety. 
Aaron's View: Another player I didn't consider at all this week, instead I went for Casemiro due to his performance and high rating in MARCA.
Javier Pastore – CM – PSG
PSG continue to make a mockery of the competition in Ligue 1 this season, recording yet another high scoring victory against Nantes, winning easilly, 4-1. Two goals from Cavani in this one, but EA have instead opted to select yet another midfielder with a goal and an assist to his name in Pastore. That’s PSG’s 43rd goal in just 13 league matches this season plus a record breaking 24 in the Champions League group stages. 
Aaron's View: I went for Edinson Cavani from this match after his brace and MOTM performance. Obviously this one was a little too close to his previous IF for EA and as such, they went for the next best thing.
Gian Marco Ferrari – CB – Sampdoria
Sampdoria were the big winners last weekend surviving a late surge from Juventus to hold out for an impressive 3-2 win against the reigning champions. Centre back Gian Marco Ferrari (great name) scored one of Sampdoria’s trio of goals but after conceding two late strikes from Higuain and Dybala, he is somewhat of a surprise defensive pick this week. 
Aaron's View: After Sampdoria's shock win against Juventus, they were always likely to pick up an IF. But with any of the starting XI in the mix, I chose to avoid this fixture.
Melero – CM – SD Huesca
And finally, over to the Spanish Second Division where Huesca took on Tenerife in Match Week 15. Melero scored twice here in Huesca’s 3-0 win, which sees them stay top of the league just ahead of Lugo and Osasuna. Melero himself is having a fine season from central midfield, scoring an impressive nine goals so far, and very much deserving of this IF. 
Aaron's View: For the final spot in my prediction, I went for a second Ajax player in Van Beek, who scored three goals. But seeing as he missed out, Malero with a brace and assist is a more than reasonable replacement."

Market Overview
Generally, a pretty tame week for the FIFA Ultimate team market, with prices ebbing and flowing naturally in a stable manner. On the horizon, the winds of FUTmas are picking up, and last year that brought some great player Squad Building Challenges, so players are investing accordingly in the 82-84 rated items. 
But in the Ones to Watch market some players exploded due to Team of the Group Stage hype (looking at you Tolisso). It does seem like that team is poised to include multiple OTW items, so it will be great to see if those upgrades impact their price the same way as TOTW inclusion. As that trend shows player prices plummet after their upgrade, thus selling into the hype is a viable option.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  These ranges can help give you a general feel for player’s prices. If the ranges are small like Kessie, Hernandez or Bruma you can gauge their stability. While big jumps differences like Lacazette show you what to expect if they gain some hype. 
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take: Notice that a lot of players considered for TOTGS have large volatility numbers (i.e Mbappe and Salah). Yet, it might be worth looking into trading players like Semedo and Keita who have large fluctuations per their price range.   

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of a card to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Some noticeably high betas in a week were the OTW market index trended up. Look to players like Costa or Walker to experience huge swings in price if they can put in solid performances.

TOTW Shout
Note Champions League games do not usually count towards informs. But, two OTW players had some compelling performance over the weekend in Yarmolenko and Sigurdsson. The Ukrainian winger scored a winner, while the Iceman notched one in an Everton rou 
In-depth daily analysis

For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner -- Ederson (Manchester City)
Have to mention the man Tolisso scoring a brace and going extinct for a little; however, we already featured him in this section. So, to preserve diversity we’ll take about another city player: Ederson. 
The Brazilian stopper has some fascinating stats from the past week with a weekly return of 31.9%, a high volatility (~6400) and a high beta (-1.80). The volatility has mainly reflected his price trending up, but his beta is something to consider. If Ederson does not feature his price could diminish quickly. 
A large component of his price rise can be explained by the hype surrounding his Champions League performances, leading to a TOTGS upgrade. That being said when you read this the team will probably be live, although it is important to look to his trend as a precedent for other OTW items in the future.
Big Loser --  Bertrand Traore (Lyon)
It was tough to pick a true loser this week, but we also felt that Bertrand Traore is an interesting case study. The Lyon winger has played very well this season, but Memphis Depay is stealing the show on the opposite flank. That type of situation puts Traore in a pickle. 
Looking at his weekly stats, he saw a sizable negative return (-6.7%), while sporting a relatively high volatility (~1400). But the interesting thing about  here is his beta at 1.49. That is high, and it almost reflects a complete opposite scenario as Ederson. If Traore can pick up another inform, or put in a convincing performance we could see his price shoot up.
Considering the possibility of a Ones to Watch squad building challenge, as well as Lyon’s form, the ex-chelsea product could be an item to keep your eye on this holiday season. 
Recap & outlook
To wrap it up, a big wave of hype from TOTGS has driven a lot of OTW players up in price. Some of them are definitely deserving and it could be a great chance for EA to show the value of these special items. Once we get some of these upgrades we’ll have a lot more to talk about!
Some interesting final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Keep your eyes peeled for panic sellers during the TOTGS release. Lots of volatility that could go your way, or not...
-- OTW investors: Check your club for players in leagues going on a winter break. Their prices could drop, but there also is a prospect of an OTW SBC in early February.

This ... is probably not the week to open those TOTW packs or Weekend League rewards. Only two 81s and yet so little star power. Outside of those hunting a specific player item, it's a little harder than usual to get super enthused.
PSG's Edinson Cavani, fresh on the heels of being named to L'Equipe's Team of the Week and his sixth brace of the season, is the highest rated player this week. If you're a Path to Glory prospector of sorts, you wind up with a couple newly updated dynamic in-form player items: Fenerbache's Giuliano continues his journey from 81 to 86 after a one goal, one penalty performance and Marco Asensio jumps up to 86 after his part in Madrid's win over the weekend.
Alex Sandro's new 87 OVR LW item will create some interesting pre-kickoff formations, particularly amongst the pros. Other than Barcelona's Jordi Alba getting a tradeable 86 overall, you probably won't see too many others of these opposite you on the pitch for the foreseeable future.
Here's the full FIFA 18 Team of the Week 23:"

Surprise.
If you wanted something to mix things up before the expected European Tournaments Team of the Group Stage tomorrow, you've got it.
The FIFA 18 live production team released a cheeky pair of Prime Icon SBCs for the latest Throwback Thursday, this time French midfielder Robert Pirès and Portuguese legend Anderson Luís de Souza, better known as Deco.
You can get the Squad Buildling Challenge requirements for Pires here and Deco here.
Though we can't vouch for the quality of the prime Icons, the early reviews are that they prices for the two are extremely reasonable if not affordable for regular spenders/investors/hardcore players of the game. If you redeem either and want to add a review, be sure to do so here."

EA Sports have introduced several tweaks and changes to their Pro Clubs mode in FIFA 18. From kit customization to menu tweaks, here's everything new in Pro Clubs this year: 
Pre-match settings have never been more advanced. Before your match begins, you can now set which players will take your set-pieces instead of leaving it up to the randomness of the computer to select. 
Perhaps the most convenient and smart addition to the mode is the ability to set three different play style presets. Now, instead of changing your attributes, characteristics, and position, you can now create three different styles that you change in the match room. Want to switch your defensive midfielder to attacking? You can now do it with a click of one button instead of changing your pro every time. 
The way your pro's attributes and skills are acquired has been completely overhauled. The ""Skill Tree"" will now make it a little more difficult to obtain some of the more sought after skills or attributes. Instead of being able to pick any skill trait you want based on the amount of attribute points you have, you now have to unlock the best ones by going through a progression of lesser ones. It's a minor change, but one to take note of when setting up your pro. 
Kit customization was introduced last year, now they have added 12 more colors to choose from when designing your custom kits. 
These are tweaks made this year to coincide with the overall gameplay changes to FIFA 18. What do you think?"

There's a new monster striker in town, and his name is Michail Antonio. Today, we'll be looking at the England and West Ham forward, who is up there as one of the most beastly players in FUT 18.

In-Game Stats
Without the chemistry boost, his stats are already very solid. 82 sprint speed with 87 acceleration, 74+ finishing, shot power and positioning, 86 agility, 83 dribblin,g 88 heading with 84 jumping and 86 strength make him an unreal player. Oh, and he's 5'11 with the four-star/four-star combination. 

I used him with the Hawk chemistry style, which gives him a nice boost to his pace, shooting and physical. 

Squads
I used Antonio in this team:

The team is extremely, extremely solid. It completely bulldozes the AI on Legendary, and wrecked the online opponents I have faced.
My main goalscorers are Martial, Antonio and Goretzka, with Mkhi grabbing a couple and wracking up the assists. I think I have one goal with the rest of the team combined.
Stats
I've used Antonio for seven games, and here my stats with him:
Price: 8,700 coins
Games: 7
Goals: 9
Assists: 1
Onto the review.
Review
Pace: 10/10
Rapid. He does feel like he has 85 pace in game, and even faster when the Hawk chem style is applied to him. I really like his acceleration -- he can easily burst away from defenders, and then his top speed is so good that the initial lead he opens up can never be surmounted.
Dribbling: 8/10
Does feel a little clunky at times, but that's to be expected from an 80-rated card with mid-70s in the dribbling stats. However, he does have moments of pure magic, and his four-star skills make him very, very difficult to handle. His dribbling is great, but the lack of agility and balance can make turning a little tricky -- however, he does the job, and he does it well.
Shooting: 9/10
Loved it. He's clinical inside the box, and has the power to smash it from anywhere inside 30 yards. His finesse shots were consistent, and his volleys were pretty good. I loved his aerial ability -- great jumping, combined with great heading accuracy, make him a wonderful target man. His positioning was very good (despite his work rates), and I had no issues with that.
The only real negative is his inconsistency. Every so often, he will miss a chance that a higher-rated player would have scored. But that happened very rarely for me, so it didn't affect his rating too much.
Passing: 7/10
Nothing too special, but it gets the job done. Short-passing is on point, long-passing is very 50/50. Crossing has been decent, especially if I draw him short at the corner. Didn't get a chance to test out his free kicks.
Defending: N/A
His pace and power allows him to bully defenders, but his tackling and interceptions aren't anything to write home about.
Physical: 10/10
Unreal. Bullies everyone. Partner his strength and aggression with his height and pace, and you have a battering ram. He will destroy any defender who tries to shrug him off the ball. An absolute tank.
Summary
For 10,000 coins, this guy is a bargain. He's been tearing it up for me, and performs every game. He holds his own against Martial, and I don't think I'll be upgrading him any time soon. He's as good as Welliton and Emenike from FIFA 13. He's already flirting with extinction, so get him while/if you can.
In the week leading up to the official release, I'll be trying to review as many players as possible. If you have any suggestions on what players you want reviewed, or if you have any questions about the ones I have already reviewed, feel free to comment below, or send me a tweet (@Wookiechew23)!"

Last week we managed to get three of the four Marquee Matchups right, but it certainly always feels better to accurately project all the fixtures featured in the current Marquee Matchups. If any of you all happen to make some profit investing on the potential SBCs, all the better. 
Most of this this week's matches picked were fairly high profile, so maybe that will lead EA to include some more ancillary fixtures next time. Let's get into this week's picks:
Top Picks
As only four matchups tend to make the SBC, here are the four that we think are most probable to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and far from guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Manchester United vs Manchester City
Match Info: EA will be chomping at the bit for this fixture. Two of the highest profile PL teams meet in the Manchester derby, so get prepare yourself for a great match, and hopefully a great reward.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 80 rated


Player Requirement: 3 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Ajax vs PSV
Match Info: “De Topper” highlights the match week in the Netherlands, and with EA looking to spruce up their selections this rivalry has a really solid chance of being included. Plenty of non-rare gold options here. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 rated


Player Requirement: 2 to 3 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Spartak Moscow vs CSKA Moscow
Match Info: In my first predictions I believe I included a shout from the Russian League, so now we see ourselves return. Another high profile Moscow derby deserves investor’s consideration for the upcoming week.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


MLS Final (Toronto or Columbus vs Seattle or Houston)
Match Info: Unfortunately, the final isn’t set just yet; however, the final is indeed high profile enough for EA to feature. Make sure to check in on November 29th and 30th for the teams that will square off for the title. (Regardless, investing early is good) 
At time time of this article's publication, Sounders have a comfortable 2-0 lead heading back to the home leg while Toronto and Crew are level at 0-0. Toronto hosts the second, and are the favorites to advance, having won the Supporter's Shield for a record 69 points this MLS campaign. Do with those bits of information what you may.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall 


Player Requirement: 2 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there tends to be some deviation from week to week, let's take a look at some more fringe picks that could make their way in:
Liverpool vs Everton 
Match Info: A historic rivalry, the Merseyside derby would make the main picks any other week, yet I relegated it due to the Manchester derby. EA could very well choose two matches from England so consider accordingly, and maybe sell into the hype.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 79 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


West Sydney Wanderers vs Sydney FC
Match Info: Moving across the old commonwealth, Australia has a big game of their own. The two teams from Sydney square off and as usual the A-League could yield a high profit. Invest in the non-rares to minimize the risk. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from each team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry 


Liga MX Final (Morelia or Monterrey vs America or Tigres)
Match Info: Just like MLS final, Mexico has an exciting climax to their season on the horizon. Interestingly, the matchup could be the same as the Monterrey vs Tigres we saw recently, which might cause EA to ignore it. Thus it appears in the sleepers this week. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Marseille vs Saint-Etienne
Match Info: It’s difficult to leave out the French league, so to do our due diligence we have to highlight the very prominent French rivalry. Worst case one can pick up the non-rares for close to discard, and hold for other SBCs or use them as fodder in this one. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
NEW Weekly shot in the dark...
PAOK vs Panathinaikos
Investing Strategies
Let's once again take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team on how to possible make a few coins with would-be Marquee Matchups:

-- Prioritize investing in players who are members of the two teams featuring in a specific Marquee Matchup (higher rated the better)
-- Non-Rare cards usually have a higher return on investment
-- Certain positions such as LB/RB, CMs and STs are generally more profitable*"

It's been a while, FIFA community!
Today, I'm back with a review of the 86-rated POTM Leroy Sane.

Sane receives this following a scintillating month in a Manchester City shirt. The young German winger is one of the most exciting players in the Premier League, and he was always bound to receive a special item sooner rather than later.
This POTM item is only available through the POTM SBCs, where you can unlock a loan version of it (as I did), or the full one (which costs around 250-300k to do). For this review, I tried out the loan edition.
In-game Stats
At first glance, Sane has some unreal in-game stats. With 93 acceleration, 95 sprint speed, 90 positioning, 86 finishing, 85 long shots, 93 agility, 85 balance, 87 ball control, 91 dribbling, 89 stamina and 78 strength. However, he is lacking in some areas, with his average passing, composure (79), low aggression and the 3-star/3-star combo.

I used Sane with the Hawk chemistry style, giving him 99 in all pace attributes, 90+ finishing, shot power and long shots, as well as 83 strength and 74 aggression.

He started on 10 chemistry, and in-game I played him as a LF (4321) or a LS (4222, 41212(2)).
Stats
Here are my stats with Sane:
Games: 7
Goals: 7
Assists: 2
Let's get into the review.
Pace: 10/10
Credit where credit is due -- this guy is bloody fast. He's one of the fastest I have used this year, and when he gets going, he's virtually uncatchable. This is vital for wingers and forwards this year, and it means that he can turn an extra yard of space into a crucial opportunity.
Shooting: 7/10
Meh. He missed a lot of sitters, even on his strong foot. He can hit the finesse shots from the top of the box, but they are also very 50/50. His long shots were disappointing for me -- he scored two, but that was after I took close to ten. His weak foot is atrocious -- short of a tap-in, he's not scoring with it. He may have gotten a goal a game for me, but he should have gotten a lot more.
Passing: 7/10
Disappointing. He turned over possession a lot of times, despite having reasonably decent passing stats. His crossing was ok, but it did not live up to the crossing stat. It was definitely above average, but I wouldn't call his passing great. Oh, and the weak foot hurts him here too.
Dribbling: 7/10
This is what let me down. There is just something about the item that makes him almost clunky in game. Ball-control is fantastic, dribbling is fantastic, the balance and reactions are great, but the agility was nowhere close to the 93. I've had this issue with his base item as well, and I'm guessing it's just an issue with his build in-game.
Also, the lack of 4-star skills sucks. It ruins the item for me
Defending: N/A
Physical: 7/10
Another meh. Feels moderately strong, but he's still no match for the stronger players. Shielding is broken this year, so you can exploit it, but don't expect this man to be a tank.
Summary
Meh. He's a very meh player.
Will he win you games? Perhaps.
Does he fit the meta? Sort of.
He has one stand out stat, and that's his pace. Everything else is very, very average. I honestly think Martial is better than him.
Don't lock in 250k into this. If you really want to use Sane, get his Path To Glory, and wait for upgrades. This one is not worth it.
Rating: 6.5/10
Value for Coins: 4/10"

Market Overview
Black Friday has come and gone. Personally, I enjoyed most of the Flash SBCs, but was a little bummed they did not offer some sort of discount on pack prices. Alas, let’s focus on the market since this past week has given us a lot to analyze and digest. 
For weeks, there has been uncertainty as to how EA would handle the Black Friday promotion, and so in the pre-hype period last week, we saw prices fluctuate different ways. However, during the time of the event, we saw low value and high value player prices react in polar opposite ways. The lower value items (82 and below) saw their prices slashed with increased supply, while most elite players (85+ & special cards) slowly began to rise as pent up buyers began to pull the trigger. So, shifting to the Ones to Watch market, one can see the prices mostly echoed this general market trend.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take: Looking at the two categories on the graph above, it's important to note that “elite"" players, like Neymar and Mbappe are currently at their highs, while the lower-tier players (i.e Kessie and Hernandez) are at their lows. Maybe a shout to invest in the little guys? 
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take: Man, volatility returned with a bang! The broad increase in price fluctuation was a gold mine for traders if they bought and sold at the right times. Related to relative price, the volatility of players stayed consistent to patterns observed in previous weeks; however, some anomalies like Kyle Walker (unusually high) and Romelu Lukaku (unusually low) did arise.

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of a card to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: This week’s player betas really reflect how their price shifts were related to the overall market trend. As a whole the market has been rebounding, yet not so much for the lower value players and this is embodied in players like Bruma and Bertrand Traore who sport high negative values (-0.64 & -2.03, respectively).
TOTW Shout
Sorry to dissapoint, but no real meaningful in-form shouts. Hopefully we'll have better luck next week.

In-depth daily analysis

For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner -- Kyle Walker (Manchester City)
Not necessarily the highest weekly return; howeve,r Kyle Walker deserves some recognition since his prices jumped sharply after weeks of slight decline. Looking at some of his weekly roundup stats, his stand out week was marked by a large increase in his volatility (~12,300), while the ex-Spurs player spots a high positive beta of 0.82 which lends to his significant price jump as the market rose overall. 
Another thing to consider is during Black Friday there were a lot of pent up buyers, so as one of the best right backs in the Premier League he was a hot pickup. This increased demand was definitely in part responsible for Walker’s price spike.   

In real life, the English RB gets plenty of playing time for a side that is in tremendous form, both in domestic and European competition. With this form there is some hype around the defender receiving a Team of the Group Stage card, yet he’d be a dark horse at best.
Big Loser -- Bruma (RB Leipzig)
There were quite a few big declines this week, yet it's always nice to be able to focus on a player whose price point makes him relevant to most investors and traders. Recently, it seems investors have been pretty fed up with Bruma’s lack of quality performances even though he gets solid minutes, so the Portuguese winger has ended up in the biggest loser spot. 
Looking at some statistics, the -17% weekly return really sticks out, but his medium range volatility (~1500) and high negative beta (-0.64) reflect his poor price performance this period. Taking a step back, it was always a little unreasonable when he was selling for around 45-50k; however, as he nears the 20k mark one should ask is now a good time to invest? 
If you’re truly contemplating the preceding question, make sure you take a holistic approach. At 81, he isn’t anything special, but pace and a solid nation isn’t anything to scoff at. Lastly, the Bundesliga winter break is right around the corner and close to a month off will at the very least cause his value to stagnate, or most likely take another hit.


Recap & outlook
To wrap it up, now that Black Friday has come to pass, the hype train can finally die down. To reiterate, the OTW market saw lower value players dip in prices, while the upper tier items have began appreciating in value. These two different reaction were not necessarily surprising, but does offer some interesting final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Volatility is up, so be looking out for deals. The market has continued to creep up, so look to open bids on numerous players for some great quick flips.
-- OTW investors: If you’re looking to buy the elite players it might be best to get in soon, but stay cautious. On the other hand, the low rated items are hitting some all time lows.Windows tightening on picking up deals and Team of The Group Stage (TOTGS) investments… 
Although a major hype horizon is now in the rear view mirror, investors and traders alike should start planning accordingly for the likes of TOTGS, FUTmas and league winter breaks. All the preceding events are poised to have a significant impact on the market, so rest assured look to us to have it covered.

What a curveball from EA with the Marquee Matchups this week! Definitely some debatable inclusions from them, but they tend to do that when certain matchups are receiving too much hype, like the Manchester derby. 
That being said, all we can do is put our heads down and keep plugging, so here’s this week's predictions:
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Athletic Bilbao vs Real Sociedad
Match Info: How refreshing to not start with a Premier League rivalry; we turn our attention to Spain. Specifically, the Basque region, where a historically intense match should catch the eye of EA. Plenty of really solid non-rare golds to keep risk low and profits high.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Olympique Lyonnais vs Olympique de Marseille
Match Info:  As always, the trustworthy Ligue 1 offers a great matchup between two prominent teams that warrant the consideration of the FIFA live content team. Le Choc des Olympiques is a fascinating derby that features a unique rivalry that is not based in malice, but rather competitiveness. Again look to the non-rares.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 rated


Player Requirement: 2 to 3 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Manchester City vs Tottenham Hotspur
Match Info: You knew it was coming: a Premier League fixture. Although Spurs have faltered in domestic form recently, this match has some serious title implications, even though it's before Christmas. Even if its omitted, PL investments could payoff during POTM or FUTmas.  

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Club Brugge vs Anderlecht
Match Info: I included a Belgian cup match a few predictions ago. However, this time, the Pro League sees a huge rivalry between two of its most prominent sides. Another low risk and high reward due to the number of non-rares; this fixture really excites us.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 75 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there tends to be some variance each week, let's take a look at some more outside the box picks that could make their way in:
Bayern Munich vs Stuttgart 
Match Info: Yes, a Bundesliga fixture was already included, but, it’s important to note that after December 17, the league goes on their long winter break. With limited time remaining, it’s hard to see EA not getting in these while they can, and our pick would be the Südderby.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Sparta Rotterdam vs Feyenoord
Match Info: Another week with a big derby in the Netherlands. Its uncharacteristic for EA to include a “smaller” league twice, but after this past week, I guess we have to truly expect the unexpected. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from each team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry 


KS Cracovia vs Wisła Kraków
Match Info: We circle back to Poland where this time the Holy War derby marks their match week. Any rivalry with that cool a name deserves consideration, yet EA also used this fixture last year. Will we see a repeat? 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 70 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


FC Nantes vs Angers SCO
Match Info: Just to cover that EA curveball, there’s another lesser known rivalry in France coming next weekend. The Derby de l'ouest, is actually quite an important game for both clubs. Nantes is pushing for Europe while Angers are fighting to stave off relegation.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
Let's continue our latest addition, another weekly shot in the dark.
Club World Cup Fixture (Real Madrid vs Urawa Red Diamonds if it happens...) 
Investing Strategies
It's that time. Remember to take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team on how to possible make a few coins with would-be Marquee Matchups:

-- Prioritize investing in players who are members of the two teams featuring in a specific Marquee Matchup (higher rated the better)
-- Non-Rare cards usually have a higher return on investment
-- Certain positions such as LB/RB, CMs and STs are generally more profitable*"

And we're back!
Over the next week, I'll be trying to review as many players as I can. We begin with our lord and saviour from FUT 17, the young French forward, the one you knew about but couldn't stop -- the one, the only, Anthony Martial.

I used Martial for almost 600 games last year, and he was my first big purchase this year. After loading up some FIFA points, the moment I had 20K to pick him up (he's even higher now), I pulled the trigger.
In-Game Stats
Just like last year, Martial has some incredible stats. He has 92 acceleration, 90 sprint speed, 81 finishing, 84 shot power, 85 agility, 84 ball control, 88 dribbling, 76 strength and 78 composure.

Throw in his height, and his four-star skills/four-star weak foot combination, and you have yourself an elite tier player.
I personally used Martial with the Hawk chemistry style, which boosts his stats to 97 pace, 86 shooting and 79 physical.
Squad
I used Martial in this team:

The team is extremely, extremely solid. It completely bulldozes the AI on Legendary, and wrecked the two online opponents I faced.
Stats
I've used Martial for 7 games so far, and here are his stats in those games:
Price: 20,000 coins (XB1)
Chemistry Style: Hawk
Games: 7
Goals: 8
Assists: 6
Let's get into the review.
Review
Pace: 10/10
He's very fast. I could leave it at that. He's almost impossible to catch up to, and he can utilize this ability to devastating effect. Get him past the backline, and he will do the rest. His pace makes him a great player to have up front, but also means he can be used pretty successfully as a winger.
Dribbling: 10/10
Silky smooth. SImply mesmerising. The ball is stuck to his feet, his skill moves are executed perfectly, and he is impossibly hard to dispossess. For someone who has as much pace as him, his dribbling is surprising -- he doesn't struggle to control the ball, even when he's at his top speed. He stops instantly, turns perfectly, and is a joy to use.
Shooting: 9/10
It gets the job done, and then some. His finesse shots from the edge of the box are incredible, and his finishing in and around the box is superb. From pretty much any angle, on either foot, he can challenge the keeper. Positioning is solid, and his heading is unbelievable -- he wins everything in the air, and his accuracy is spot-on. The only real downside is that his long shots are kind of meh, but once he gets close to goal, he'll score.
Passing: 7/10
He's no Pirlo, but it gets the job done. Crossing is very good, short passing is virtually perfect, and his long passes work out far more often than not. His free kicks aren't the best, so I don't advise that you take them with him.
Defending: N/A
He's strength, pace, height and jumping means he can harrass defenders constantly, but he's not world-famous for his tackling ability.
Physical: 10/10
This is what makes the card so good. He's incredibly powerful in-game. His height, combined with decent strength and aggression, makes him an absolute tank. He's the definition of a beast. He shrugs off most full backs like they aren't even there, and he holds his own against the best centerbacks. His jumping is superb, so he wins virtually everything in the air, making him the ideal target man.
Summary
He's as good as last year. I'm tempted to say he's even better this year, since good pace and dribbling are more apparent with these game mechanics, and his power makes him a one-of-a-kind player. He's pretty expensive now, but he'll only be more expensive upon wider release.
I may have made 20K on this card, but I'm never selling him. He's going to be in my club for the rest of year. He's just that good.

In the week leading up to the official release, I'll be trying to review as many players as possible. If you have any suggestions on what players you want reviewed, or if you have any questions about the ones I have already reviewed, feel free to comment below, or send me a tweet (@Wookiechew23)!"

FIFA's second major update in as many weeks is here, available on PC now. But let's get this out of the way to start: As we mentioned last week with Title Update 4, FIFA 18's patch cycle appears set to be rapid and iterative. It's our read that we're going to get more patches than we've ever gotten before in any previous versions of the game. That's certainly good news in that more community requested fixes EA are able to both verify as needs and patch on their end will get tackled than ever before. It also means more and more indignation every time a perceived more urgent bug isn't tackled at the speed you may want it to be.
If you don't see something you think needs fixed addressed, that doesn't mean it's not on EA's radar. And just because something else got fixed, it likely just means it was fixed in either the order it was brought to the development team's radar, or because it was able to get done and tested before this release, not because it's a higher priority or anything else. If EA only fixed high-hanging fruit, there'd be fewer patches and less would get done.
Of course, it's always worth considering that maybe that thing you think is game breaking doesn't actually pan out to be so when looking at the entire landscape of players from 30,000 feet. Some ""bugs"" are subjective; others less so. Gameplay (and glitch) criticism is fair game, of course, but having complete information (e.g. gameplay data from over 30,000,000 players) sometimes paints things in a different picture.
That said, let's start with the big one.
Did they fix the ""No-Loss Glitch""?
That was actually addressed in an eleventh hour addition to the consoles' patch released earlier this week. This next patch -- which is available on PC now and ostensibly will come to console next week -- fixes other things. Here's the release notes from last week reflecting as much: 
    Interesting. A new update appears to finally fix the so-called “No-Loss Glitch”. A post shared by Futhead (@futheadpics) on Nov 28, 2017 at 11:37am PST

The hope here (and amongst the community surely) is that particular glitch is now a thing of the past. If you're still seeing suspect behavior where players in the Top 100 leaderboard are getting more losses in FUT Champions channel than their record would indicate, putting those on EA's radar is the move.
So what did get fixed and what should we care about?
Here are the release notes, courtesy of EA (emphasis ours):

Addressed the following issues in Gameplay:
-- A freeze happening, in some situations, during the goal celebration for a goal that was scored by the goalkeeper.
-- The goal celebration being skipped, in some situations, after a goal was scored by the goalkeeper.
-- Holding the sprint button will once again cause a goalkeeper to get up quickly if he is on the ground while holding the ball.  
-- The player sometimes being in control of the wrong player in a Skill Game.
-- Stringing the juggle skill move together multiple times in the Practice Arena could cause your player to disappear.
-- Updated the default FIFA Trainer settings for the Intro Match to show both Movement and Mechanics instead of just Movement.

Addressed the following issues in Online Modes:
-- Captains, or players that had just transferred captaincy to another player, getting disconnected or crashing after inviting another club to a match in Pro Clubs Friendlies in some situations.

Made the following changes in FIFA Ultimate team:
-- Added the ability to watch FUT Champions Channel replays in a slower (0.5x) playback speed.
       -- When toggling the playback speed of the replay, it cycles through Normal --> Fast --> Slow. 
-- Removed the Single Player Camera from the list of available camera angles in FUT Champions Channel.
-- Removed the non-functional Restart button in the FUT Champions Channel Pause Menu.
-- Renamed the FIWC Stadium item to FeWC Stadium.

Addressed the following issues in FIFA Ultimate team:
-- FUT Squads that had default tactics values that were incorrectly set to over 100 have been reset to the normal default values.
-- A visual issue where sometimes the kit that a player selected to play with would not be the kit that their opponent would see them playing with in FUT Online modes.  
-- The FUT Squad Battles Featured Squad image not loading properly after rapidly transitioning through screens.
-- The Pause Menu countdown timer sometimes displaying throughout a FUT Champions Channel replay.
-- The scrolling team lineup list sometimes displaying at the start of a FUT Champions Channel replay.
-- The penalty shootout tutorial sometimes displaying during a penalty shootout in a FUT Champions Channel replay.

Addressed the following issues in Audio / Visual / Presentation:  
-- Updates to the 2D portraits for some players.

Thanks to those who’ve provided feedback. Throughout the course of the FIFA 18 season we'll provide you with more information and updates if and when they become available.

The FIFA Team

While not implemented yet, it does appear as well that the groundwork has been laid for a future update that'll allow searches for Squad Fitness, a long, long overdue tweak. It's not working at present, however:
With the new patch its possible to search for squad fitness cards. @TimKalation @FUT18_HUNTER @UniqueRiggers pic.twitter.com/bqnl9pzMcj— Christopher017 (@1989christopher) November 30, 2017

All in all, this seems to be another patch focused on tackling a broad array of less critical issues than any one big fix. There's plenty more to come (maybe as soon as next week), so if you're hung up on one (or a small number) of issues, you might see them tackled sooner than you might think."

With International week done and dusted and real football back on the TV, Aaron's predictions are back in the low numbers with just eight players missed from TOTW 11. But as always a few biggies have slipped the net including a few who responded to our incorrect predictions from the last week to make the TOTW proper this time around. 
Raheem Sterling – RW – Man City
Ten-man Huddersfield put up a brave fight at the John Smith’s Stadium last weekend but after the red card for La Parra was awarded, you sensed the result would only end up one way. And that it did, with man of the moment Raheem Sterling netting yet another late winner in the 83rd making it 11 on the spin for City. Sterling now has 8 goals and 3 assists in 13 league games and a second FUT 18 IF. 
Aaron's View: Just the one goal for Sterling which wasn't enough for me, but with the lack of Premier League options there was always going to be a couple of iffy choice this week.
Casemiro – CDM – Real Madrid
Aaron picked him for TOTW 10, but this time the Brazilian general has made the cut for his contribution in Real Madrid’s hard fought 3-2 win at home to Malaga. Casemiro scored this week which combined with an impressive showing against Atletico the week prior gets him in to TOTW 11 on accumulated good form. But even with Real’s recent up-turn in results they remain fourth, and eight points adrift of leaders Barcelona. 
Aaron's View: I punted on Casemiro last week and it turned out to be wrong but another good performance from him this week looks to have done the trick.
Ever Banega – CM – Sevilla
There was a flurry of 3-2 results in La Liga this week as it happens, with Sevilla and Villarreal duking it out in yet another hotly contested match. Sevilla came out on top in this one with Ever Banega remaining cool under to pressure to net his sides winning goal from the penalty spot. Banega also assisted team mate Lenglet in the win which see’s Sevilla climb to fifth. 
Aaron's View: MARCA only gave Banega a two star rating and usually three are needed for an IF which put me off him this week. Especially with the midfield already being packed with good options for TOTW 11.
Marvin Zeegelaar – CB – Watford
When they aren’t being carved up by Jesse Lingard, Watford are doing rather well this season and that form continued last weekend against Newcastle where they ran out comfortable winners 3-0. Zeegelaar grabbed just a single assist here on only his third start for Watford in the league this season making this IF is perhaps a little premature. But that said, face mask IF’s don’t come around that often so I’m willing to let this one slide. 
Aaron's View: Zeegelaar played well but with only one assist I opted for a second Southampton player in Ryan Bertrand.
Stefan De Vrij – CB – Lazio
Lazio came within an inch of a win against Fiorentina but were denied late on by a Babacar penalty to tie the game up at 1-1. Lazio’s goal came from De Vrij who powered the ball in to the net after a set piece from Luis Alberto. But with no clean sheet he does not have the TOTW defender criteria fully met. So perhaps a slightly generous pick. 
Aaron's View: A goal and a seven from Gazzetta always put De Vrij in with a chance, but with so many defenders already in my prediction I just couldn’t find space for him.
Volkan Demirel – GK – Fenerbache
There are tough picks, and then there are impossible picks, and this one is certainly the latter. Fenerbacha recorded a 1-0 win against Antalyaspor but in a match with nothing really to write home about Demirel made three saves and grabbed a clean sheet. But that is literally it. Odd. 
Aaron's View: Three saves and a clean sheet for Demirel in an obscure league in terms of finding ratings. Next to impossible to get this one right.
Filip Kostic – LM – Hamburg SV
Hamburg are flirting with the relegation places in the Bundesliga but that didn’t stop them putting in an impressive home performance beating Hoffenheim comfortably 3-0. Filipe Kostic scored the second goald of the three and was Hamburg’s best player on the day by some distance. But as with De Vrij this is perhaps generous given Kostic has no recent good form to back up his single goal. 
Aaron's View: Just the one goal for Kostik and so I instead opted for POTW Harit, but seeing as he was a silver it looks as though EA have gone down the list to Kosik, who was the highest rated gold in terms of Kicker.
Rogelio Funes Mori – ST – Monterrey
Twin brother of Everton’s Ramiro Funes Mori; Rogelio Fune Mori put in a fine strikers display for Monterrey in an all action display against Atlas in their 2-1 win by grabbing both goals. Funes Mori also scored again three days later against the same side this time in a 4-1 win. So all-in-all not a bad week for the Argentinian.

Aaron's View: This one has no logic whatsoever. I opted for Hurtardo, who played LW, scoring twice and assisting another. Instead EA opted for Funes Mori who scored one and assisted another in the same match. Hurtardo also picked up MOTM. Can’t really be justified."

As Champions League and Europa League's group stages draw towards their conclusion, it's time to predict who the FIFA production team will choose in their upcoming Team of the Group Stage squad release. The squad has been released in-game each of the past two FIFAs the second Friday of December (that'd be 8 December). Lending his very own predictions as to who will make the squad is none other than YouTuber/Twitch streamer/friend of Futhead and former FIFA Community Manager, Chu Boi. 
In his latest video, Chu outlines who he believes should feature in the TOTGS. Using Futhead's Squad Builder and card customization options, he was able to put together a pretty decent prediction of what the squad may look like. 
Chu's squad consists of the best English Premier League, La Liga Santander, Serie A, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1 players to perform in both Champs League and Europa. 
Make sure to stay on the lookout for the awaited release. EA first introduced TOTGS in FIFA 17 on the Friday after the final matches of the group stage. As mentioned, that would suggest that this year's release may fall 8 December.
You can check out Chu's complete TOTGS prediction here.

FIFA 18 Ultimate Team's Team of the Week was a little too top heavy a week ago. This Wednesday, particularly with the likely European Tournaments Team of the Group Stage just on the horizon -- think Friday, forecasters -- the helpings are a little more generous across the board.
SIF David De Gea gets the nod, as expected by the populous but doubted by some forecasters (including ours) after a record-tying performance that also yielded a goal allowed in a fantastic Manchester United-Arsenal Match over the weekend. Gunners' Mesut Ozil gets his second FUT 18 special item as well, but at RF, he's going to be a Squad Buildling Challenge investment and little more for most.
While there are a couple other name brand items worth consideration -- 'sup, Philippe Coutinho? -- a real bargain-beast may come in the form of in-form ST Serge Gnabry. The Bayern loanee got a monstrous +9 shooting and +9 physical, during a weekend of pack offerings which could make his supply plentiful.
If there are any items which jump out to you more than any others, definitely let us know in the comments below. As per usual, you can check out the complete FUT 18 TOTW 12 here.:"

A cheeky 2 p.m. UK time reveal saw the FIFA community and the world meet the newly rechristened FUT 18 European Team of the Tournaments: Group Stage. The 23 special player items will be in packs from this evening at 6 p.m. UK (1 p.m. ET in North America) until the following Friday at the same time. A social graphic initially mistakenly identified the players' availability as ending next Wednesday, but fret not.
It was widely expected, but 95 ST Cristiano Ronaldo, fresh on the heels of a real life fifth Ballon d'Or win, leads the squad. A 92 CAM Eden Hazard is arguably the second most tasty item though many would gladly take the 91 CM Kevin De Bruyne as well. Neymar gets a boost up to 93 for those lucky enough to be hanging on to his dynamically upgraded Ones to Watch item, while FIFA 18-meta star Kylian Mbappé also gets a bump to his OTW.
In what'll undoubtedly go down as the troll of the next week, AC Milan's Andre Silva gets one of the blue-and-white items, and in the process sets up this reaction for many opening their packs on console:

            Updated on
            



FIFA Mobile Season 2 kicked off yesterday, with a whole load of fun new features.
One of these , which I have been looking forward to, is ""Matchups"", which replaces Coin Ups from last year. In Coin Ups, you could profit from real world results based on the tokens you got. In the new feature, you get to predict the result of four big matches from each weekend, earning an increasingly better reward based on how many you predict correctly.
As I did with my Impact player predictions last year, I will try and help you out by giving a little analysis of each game and then picking who I feel will be the victor in each match.
*Note -- If the game ends in a draw, you will be credited with a loss. Root against draws accordingly.
Borussia Dortmund v Bayern Munich
As a Dortmund fan, I will obviously be rooting for a home win, but even I have to admit that this game is almost certainly going to end one way. Dortmund are in terrible form, with only 1 win in their last 6 games and that was a cup win against 3. Bundesliga side Madgeburg. Bayern, on the other hand, played a half team against Celtic in their Champions League fixture in preparation for 'Der Klassiker' on Saturday night. They will be well rested and well prepared for a trip to the former fortress that is the Signal Iduna Park in the aim of getting a seventh successive win in a row since they sacked Carlo Ancelotti.
My prediction: Bayern win

Manchester City v Arsenal
Manchester City are in insane form. They have jumped to a 5 point lead over their closest neighbours and rivals Manchester United, in the past 3 weeks.  With 19 goals in their last 6 games (including a blank against Wolves in the cup), there seems to be no stopping them from scoring. Arsenal have started turning things around in the past week or two with wins over Swansea and Everton. However, I can't see them keeping up their winning streak against one of the best teams in Europe.
My prediction: Manchester City win

Chelsea v Manchester United
This game looks like it could be very close on paper. Chelsea comes off the back of a very poor 3-0 loss to Roma in the Champions League but had 3 solid wins in the Premier League before that. Manchester United seemed to struggle to a 2-0 win over Benfica, with another awful goal conceded by Benfica's 18 year old keeper Mile Svilar and a penalty from Daley Blind. I believe that Chelsea will have a slight upper hand due to having no injury concerns, and Morata and Hazard starting to form an excellent partnership, while Lukaku and Mkhitaryan are struggling for form.
My prediction: Chelsea win

Lokomotiv Moscow v CSKA Moscow
I'd assume this is the game that most people will struggle with predicting. In one of the Moscow derbys, top of the table Lokomotiv host third placed CSKA in what should be a good game. Lokomotiv come into the game after a convincing win over second placed Zenit last weekend, but a disappointing 2-1 loss at home to Moldovan side S. Tiraspol. An injury to their keeper Guilherme forced him to be substituted in the 33rd minute, so it remains to be seen if he will be fit enough to play at the weekend. CSKA Moscow's results were mirrored, with a 1-0 loss to mid-table Arsenal Tula in the league, followed by a 2-1 win away to Basel in the Champions League. I can see this match ending in a draw, but if I had to pick one team to win, I'd go with the hosts purely due to home advantage and their striker Jefferson Farfan having 3 goals in their last 2 games.
My prediction: Lokomotiv Moscow

That's who I think will win the four Matchups games this week. Who do you think will get the wins? Remember, that if you get all 4 games correct, you will win a special 83-overall Gabriel Jesus!
Good luck and happy predicting!"

It's a tale of two Kluiverts.
Today, I'll be pitting the 86-rated Kluivert against the 86-rated Kluivert (spoiler alert: Kluivert > Kluivert).
As part of the Ultimate Scream promotion, EA released a 74-rated Justin Kluivert Scream card. From October 29th to November 1st, his card was boosted up to an 86-rated Scream item, with the same face card stats as his father's 86-rated Icon card.
I used the Kluiverts in this squad:

Contrary to what many people think, they do not have the same in-game stats.


Justin Kluivert:
Price: 28,000
Games: 7
Goals: 7
Assists: 4
Patrick Kluivert:
Price: 599,000
Games: 7
Goals: 4
Assists: 1
As you can see, there was a clear winner in the battle between the Father and the Son (the Holy Spirit wasn't around for this part, so we won't be ranking him).
Let's take a closer look at how they compared in game.
Pace: Justin has just the one more acceleration over his father, and yet he was much, much faster in game. I chalking it up to his agility and balance, but I also think it's just a factor of the player body types. Justin has a much leaner and lankier build in game than Patrick, which may contribute to this.
Verdict: Kluivert (J) > Kluivert (P)
Shooting: This is one where the card stats are deceptive -- Justin has far less positioning, but manages to match his father's 86-shooting rating through a combination of 88 volleys and 86 penalties. I found both their shooting stats to be equally good -- the finishing is the same on both cards, and the shot power and long shots very solid too. However, I found it easier to find space with Justin, and therefore he got into more scoring positions.
Verdict: Kluivert (J) = Kluivert (P)
Passing: Another one where the son absolutely smashed his old man. Both of them have atrocious long passing, both are solid at close range, but Justin's crossing was incredible. I even switched Kluivert and Kluivert in game to give Papa Kluivert a chance to show off his crossing, but he's nowhere close to his son. Justin's vision was also incredible, allowing him to ping perfect passes past passive defenses.
Verdict: Kluivert (J) > Kluivert (P)
Dribbling: Yet another victory for the kid. Daddy Kluivert feels so stiff in-game, due to his low(er) balance and agility, while Kid Kluivert just glides across the pitch. I found their ball-control to be very similar, with Justin just edging it in the dribbling department. But the agility and balance boost that Kid K has puts him a level above his old man.
Verdict: Kluivert (J) > Kluivert (P)
Physical: Yup, you guessed it - whatever Dad can do, this kid can do it better. He lasts longer out on the field, and his marginally lower strength is more than made up for with his much better aggression. The only thing Patrick can do better is jumping, but that didn't help him out too much here, since Justin already has the 80 jumping stat.
Verdict: Kluivert (J) > Kluivert (P)
Summary
As you can see, Kluivert > Kluivert. It's not even close, in my opinion -- Kluivert wipes the floor with Kluivert. Keep in mind that Kluivert's boost is only temporary, so you should get to trying him out as soon as you can.
As for the other Kluivert, he's a solid card. But is he worth 600k? Absolutely not. The lack of agility and balance (probably due to his advanced age) really let this card down, and are singlehandedly the reason why his son's boosted crushes him in-game.
Try out Justin Kluivert while you can -- I loved using the card, and I'm looking forward to other times in the future when he gets boosted to his terrifying best."

Today, I'll be reviewing one of my favorite players in FUT 18 - the 88-rated Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

I want to preface this review by saying that I play Zlatan at RCM in the 4321 (in before all the ""I didn't know Nep was on FUTHead"" comments). I find that a player like him is very useful to have in middle of the park. His height, his power, his great dribbling and solid passing all make for a brilliant attacking minded midfielder. He just doesn't have the pace I need my strikers to have, but I love his card, so I've moved him back into the midfield.
With that out of the way, let's begin.
In-Game Stats

Key Stats: 86 positioning, 87 finishing, 91 shot power, 85 long shots, 83 vision, 84 short passing, 81 agility, 88 ball control, 88 strength, 84 aggression
I use the engine chemistry style on Zlatan, which gives him the following boosts.

Squad
This is the squad I'm using Zlatan in:

In-game I swap Zlatan and Crespo, and Mane and Mkhitaryan.

Stats
Here are my stats with Zlatan:
Price: 157,000
Games: 267
Goals: 137
Assists: 64
Those stats would be impressive as a Striker, and they are mind-boggling for a center-midfielder.
Let's get into the review.
Review
Pace: 8/10
Let's start with the elephant in the room - his pace.
Simply put, it's absolutely fine. It's better than fine - it's very effective in game. No matter what his card stats say, he is not slow. The combination of great dribbling, good agility, and his tall frame make him far faster in-game than I expected. He easily feels like he has 80 pace, and in the 250+ games I've used him, I have had no issues with this stat. He's a little slow off the mark, but once he gets going, he's not easy to catch.
Shooting: 10/10
Perfection. He can finish anything, from anywhere, on either foot, with any kind of shot. The single best shooter I have used this year - he's even better than Del Piero. Absolutely clinical inside the box, no matter who the keeper is or who the defenders marking him are. From range, he will tear the net with ease. Just before writing this review, he scored a 35-yard outside of the foot curler into the the top corner while being man-handled by the deadly duo of Sergio Ramos and Eric Bailly. The number of times he has bailed me out is incredible - whenever I need a savior, I get the ball to him at the edge of the box, press shoot, and celebrate before the ball hits the back of the net.
Passing: 9/10
Very, very good. With the engine chemistry style, he's a very capable passer of the ball, and that shows in-game. His short passing is immaculate, and while he struggles on the most difficult of long passes and through-balls, he's comes through the vast majority of the time. I especially like his driven passes, mainly due to the power he generates when striking the ball.
Dribbling: 9/10
Almost perfect. A little let down with his balance, but his high physicality makes up for it, and keeps him on his feet a lot of the time. On the ball he is superb - close-control is world class, the skill moves are executed in an instant, and his first touch is godlike. He's a dream to dribble with.
Defending: 7/10
This will surprise some of you, but his defending is solid. A combination of great height and long legs, incredible strength and aggression, and a tendency to float around the middle of the park all make him great at breaking up the play. He intercepts a lot of passes, and he's able to snuff out a lot of chances in the midfield. Just run up to the player you want to dispossess, and he'll just bully him off the ball, or stick his leg in to make an awkward tackle. However, he shouldn't be your main defensive player.
Physicality: 10/10
Awesome. If you use shielding correctly, he can hold off anyone, and I love that about the card. Once you get in front of a defender, it's game over/ If you need a player to slow down the play and hold up the ball, this is your man. His jumping is better than his card stats say, which makes him even better in-game.
Heading: 10/10
I wanted to add this section, because he is lethal in the air. He's at the front post when it comes to corners, and he wins everything, and scores a lot of them. He just casually flicks it backwards, and it usually hits the far side-netting.
Summary
I love Ibra in this game. He might not be the sort of player I can use at striker, but he's performed remarkably well in the middle of the park for me. What Zlatan brings to the table is his incredible ability to change a game. He can create chances out of nothing, and he will singlehandedly win you games. At his current price, he's someone you need to bring into the side.
Rating: 9/10
Value for Coins: 9/10"

EA's second iteration of their ""FIFA Mobile"" title appears imminent. Whether that's days or weeks, with the market closed on Season One for maintenance and all the major plans in-game set to expire November 1st, unless those are extended with a server side change/content update, it would seem we're likely to be getting an updated version of the game as soon as the next week or so.
On Saturday, a few intrepid minds on the social media site Twitter realized that EA had a bit prematurely uploaded a screen shot of the new home screen from the updated game in a support article.
The updated visuals are sharp. It looks to be a notable desgin progression from the now over a year old menus from Season 1. And there's also a certain vibe in line with EA's other mobile titles, most notably the updated 2018 version of Madden for mobile devices.
But what about the bigger takeaways? What did we learn from the admittedly modest reveal late Friday/early Saturday?
Stamina stacks
If you've played Madden, you're already familiar with this. When you obtain stamina as a result of say completing a daily achievement or activity, instead of the bar maxing out at 30 and not going any higher as was the case in Season 1, stamina will now go beyond your ""cap"" and not deplete/refill until you've used all your excess.
It's a really great way to equip yourself for long grinds when necessary. And certainly a welcome and fun addition to FIFA.
New formations?
This one is a bit more of a logical leap, but ""4-3-3 Attack"" wasn't a formation we saw in S1. ""4-3-3 Wing Attack"" was, however. Is this just the former rebranded? Or could it mean we're looking at some additional formations to mix things up in the new version of the game?
We already knew the game would be going to 11 man squads instead of the 27 ones we'd grown accustomed to over the year. It will be interesting to see if that coincides with some new tactical options as well.
The Market looks locked at launch
This one is trickier to navigate. If you look above, you certainly see the individual appears to be making their way through a ""Training camp"" Campaign, part of the new Campaigns feature. Will you be able to access the transfer market when you're done with all nine (evidently) training nodes? Will the market maybe not be open to anyone for a couple weeks into the game? Or perhaps, will you have to level your squad up to a certain threshold in order to access the market? 
If you notice in the screenshot at the top of this post, the person taking the capture is only Level 1. Maybe you have to get to Level 2, or 4, or 5 or some such in order to gain access to buying and selling players. Given that it looks to be that Events require you to reach Level 2 to unlock and Level 4 for Leagues, requiring players to reach something like Level 3-5 to get to the market would certainly make sense. We'll have to see when the game is released sometime in the hopefully not too distant future to know for certain.

Nothing ground breaking perhaps, but the revelations certainly means we're one step closer to FIFA Mobile Season 2 launch, be it in a couple of days or a couple of weeks. What are you most excited about in FIFA Mobile Season 2 from what you've seen so far?"

The seventh FIFA 18 Team of the Week is here.
As predicted (here and elsewhere), it's not exactly super star-studded. But in fairness, it's not an ""off-season"" so-called  ""Team of the 'Weak'"" either.
Juventus' Gonzalo Higuain, in some of the best form we've seen out of him in many moons, leads the way. He's joined by a pair of stud strikers in fellow ""Calcio A""-man (and the winner of Halloween), Dries Mertens and one time Neymar-squab partner, Edinson Cavani.
The rest of the side is fairly take it or leave it. But hey, at least a number of them will hypothetically be useful in future Squad Buildling Challenges?

While some of us are still waiting for FIFA Mobile's Season 2 update to come to the Google Play store, the revised game's first Team of the Week is here -- with a twist.
TOTW (as well as the old event favorite, Player of the Month), are both back in S2, but now as Events. 
""Every week, Players will be chosen to be part of the Team of the Week!"" a message in game reads. ""1 Captain, 11 Starters and 11 Reserves will be part of the TOTW. Find all the captains to unlock the  Player of the Month!"" it adds.
Each week, there's a training exercise (similar to a Live Event from S1). For a set amount of stamina (two for Week 1), you grind towards 100 TOTW Points. Every two stamina in this instance will get you 5-15 TOTW points closer, plus throw in 500 coins and a chance at a Silver TOTW player and a very, very slight chance at that week's captain. Week 1's TOTW's captain is none other than Manchester City's Fernandinho:

Once you reach 100 TOTW points, you're able to play that Week's TOTW Challenge. This week's is a 0-0 second half against the TOTW. If you win, you get 1,000-25,000 coins, a guaranteed Gold or better TOTW player with a shot at an Elite (including that week's captain).
There's also a Limit 10 500 FP TOTW pack, which gives you 6 TOTW players from that week including at least 3 Golds and 3 Silver player items with a chance at an Elite and the captain.
Just navigate to the Events section after you get going in Season 2 and give it a shot. The events will last a week at a time, ostensibly from Wednesday at 3 p.m. ET (8 p.m. UK, ordinarily) until the following Wednesday.
Here's the first FIFA Mobile S2 Team of the Week:
-- 85 CDM Fernandinho (Captain)
-- 87 ST Gonzalo Higuain
-- 84 ST Dries Mertens
-- 84 GK Marc Andre Ter Stegen
-- 83 ST Edinson Cavani
-- 79 RW Hirving Lozano
-- 79 RM Pablo Sarabia
-- 77 LM Vincenzo Grifo
-- 77 RM Elias Hernandez
-- 77 LWB Sead Kolasinac
-- 75 LB Fernando Marcal
-- 75 CM Lucas Torreira
-- 74 RWB Pablo Maffeo
-- 73 LWB Ashley Young
-- 71 CF Kenny Miller
-- 70 ST Ihlas Bebou
-- 70 RWB Brecht Capon
-- 69 GK Zack Steffen
-- 68 CAM Kieran Dowell

-- 67 CB Joackim Jorgensen

In a bit of a surprise announcement late Tuesday evening, the FIFA Mobile production team announced via the game's Twitter account that the second iteration of the game would be launching Wednesday, November 1 at 8 a.m. Pacific Time. That's 11 a.m. Eastern Time in North America, 3 p.m. in the UK, 8 p.m. in India, and 10 p.m. in Indonesia.
The development team added ""in certain countries, it may be a few hours after 8 a.m. [Pacific Time] before the game is live in stores to download. Be patient, it'll be there!"" They also reiterated that a reward based on your team (not your starting 11) final overall would be issued when the new season is released.
The full textent of all the ""Now & Later"" rewards from FIFA Mobile Season 1's ultimate promotion, ""Pre-Season"" should also become apparent then. Be sure to subscribe to Futhead TV on YouTube as the embargo on FIFA Mobile Season 2 videos/content will be lifted eight hours before the game's update's launch."

EA Sports have announced a new competitive structure on the Road to the FIFA eWorld Cup 2018. The FIFA 18 Global Series is being billed as the ""largest gaming competition in FIFA history"". Beginning on November 3, the first of three stages will commence online and around the world, eventually leading to two more stages and an eventual champion crowned in August 2018. 

Stage 1: Players qualify by participating in a series of online and/or live events, including the FUT Champions Cups, FIFA eClub World Cup, Licensed Qualifying Competitions and Official League Partner Qualifying Competitions (i.e. players compete as their favorite real-world club)
Stage 2: The top 128 (64 PS4 and 64 Xbox One) players will compete in Playoff events, ending when 32 of the best competitors remain
Stage 3: The top 32 players make it through to the FIFA eWorld Cup Grand Final – the pinnacle of the EA SPORTS FIFA 18 Global Series.

“Last year was a pivotal achievement for competitive FIFA, engaging millions of competitors and spectators through world football and global competition,” said Todd Sitrin, SVP and GM of the Competitive Gaming Division at EA. “In partnership with FIFA, we’re accelerating the growth of competitive gaming through the EA SPORTS FIFA 18 Global Series on The Road to the FIFA eWorld Cup 2018, producing more competition, attracting more competitors and connecting with more fans than ever before.”
“Competitive FIFA is a global entertainment phenomenon that maximizes the combined power of world football and competitive gaming in unprecedented fashion,” said Philippe Le Floc'h, Chief Commercial Officer at FIFA. “We’re thrilled to partner with EA in creating the EA SPORTS FIFA 18 Global Series as the Road to the FIFA eWorld Cup 2018 will increase the ways millions of fans consume football.”

They promised us ""select Thursdays"" ... and roughly nobody in the community actually listened.
With mounting frustation at the lack of more and more Prime Icon Squad Building Challenges, player wishes were finally granted Thursday when the FIFA live production team dropped three more tasty SBCs (along with loan iterations) worth your perusal. 
French midfielder Emmanuel Petit leads the way -- though you arguably may be better served saving coins and assets for the bigger fish, like Patrick Vieira and/or Ruud Gullit, assuming of course you can wait that long. Manchester United (and Denmark) legend Peter Schmeichel enters a rarefied air previously only occupied by the likes of Manuel Neuer and David De Gea and may appeal to some Weekend Leaguers. And of course El Matador, Luis Hernandez, gets his day in the sun as well. Expect to see him in a Castro stream sooner rather than later.
You can check out what the SBCs entail by clicking on the link in the first full paragraph. Which Prime Icon are you most excited about? Any loan versions you're going to try in the next week (which remember, is the time limit for the loan SBCs)?"

The story of Team of the Week 26 to some may in fact be the players not there. 
No Robert Lewandowski even though he had a hat-trick in a 6-0 Bayern destruction of Hamburger. No Kostas Manolas, despite scoring a goal, getting the joint highest rated from EA's usual Italian source, and aiding in a clean sheet. And perhaps most surprisingly of all, no Heung-Min Son for the second straight week, after scoring a game winner, getting Man of the Match, and putting himself in the pole position as front runner for the EA SPORTS Premier League Player of the Month for March.
All that said, if you're an ardent Ones to Watch or Path to Glory collector/trader/prospector, you're in for a gem of a week. A grand total of five dynamic player items see their ratings increase, well, dynamically. Son's teammate Serge Aurier tacked on a late goal, and for it, he finally get his first in-form of FUT 18. Fellow OTW recipient Michy Batshuayi continues his strong play during his loan move to Germany for Borussia Dortmund, and he's inform once again. Valencia's Rodrigo and Manchester United's Marcus Rashford both gets nods on the PTG front. And last, but surely not least, LAFC's Designated Player Carlos Vela makes this week's Daily Knockout Tournament, in which his PTG is the prize, even tastier.

It’s officially the end of January 2018 and by now your “New Year, new me”-styled resolutions have most likely been compromised by beer and the monotony of real life. But, these are both good things (honestly) because that means it’s time for us all to refocus and look forward to FIFA 19. Yes, FIFA 19!
As some of you know, we love a good “wish list” here on Futhead  and over the next few weeks, we’ll be looking to collate your suggestions for all the major modes and features we expect to see in FIFA 19. We’ll start the discussion ourselves, but after that we’ll be looking to you for the highest rated comments to put in to one big Futhead Community wish list. 

You could suggest:


Changes to an existing mode


Completely new features or ideas


Ways to balance features


Additions to an existing mode


Our program of Wish Lists kicks off this week with Career Mode, so get your thinking caps on. Early feedback is imperative for EA and even with FIFA 19 some eight months out, the time is now to start the conversation.

Two winners will be chosen at random from the pool of all eligible squad building entrants at the conclusion of the entry period.

Fair play to EA for their current Marquee Matchup selection -- although that AC Milan vs Udinese was a little bizarre. Hopefully they’ll keep improving the pack rewards as stockpiling packs for the upcoming Winter Ones to Watch release could be a really good shout. But, let's focus up and make some predictions.
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Spurs vs Arsenal
Match Info:  With no English sides included in the current SBCs, we kick this week off with the North London derby. After a big transfer window from Arsenal, can they overcome their higher in the standings rivals and sneak back into a Europe slot? Nevertheless, look to the non-rares for this matchup, and there should be plenty to go around.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Aston Villa vs Birmingham
Match Info:  Another big rivalry in England. However, we go to the Championship where the Second City derby highlights the weekend fixtures. This was included last year and the players skyrocketed, so get in early with the highest rated players you can. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 rated


Player Requirement: 2 to 3 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Olympique de Marseille vs AS Saint-Étienne
Match Info:  Crossing the channel into France, there is another sizable derby that features the two teams in France with the most Ligue 1 titles. It seems that whenever French sides are included in Marquee Matchups, player prices shoot up. Get in on some non-rares, and worst case sell overnight at a premium.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Kawasaki Frontale vs Cerezo Osaka (Cup Final)
Match Info:  EA selected a Portuguese cup final a couple weeks back, so with that spirit in mind we turn to Japan for their domestic cup final. It would help provide some diversity into the SBC selections, and there should be plenty of non-rare silvers to splurge on. Be smart, and possibly sell into the hype here.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there tends to be some variance each week, let's take a look at some more outside the box picks that could make their way in:
Valencia vs Levante
Match Info: Unfortunately the Valencia derby gets knocked down to sleeper, but definitely don’t overlook this fixture. The two teams sporting bat logos could be in EA’s sights as they seem to love selecting La Liga outfits, especially after the Catalan derby missed out last week.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Bayern Munich vs FC Schalke
Match Info: The Bundesliga has a match this week, and Bayern featured a couple MMs ago, so thats why this rivalry gets pushed down to sleeper. Still a high profile match between two teams whose players will hold value means you can invest here for little to no risk. Just might have to be patient.   

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Napoli vs Lazio
Match Info:  With the current 'Calcio A' selection being a tad bizarre, it seems like anything could come out of this league. That being said this clash between top four teams presents the most compelling case, and if you want a rivalry look to Fiorentina vs Juventus. Plenty of value in this league due to league SBC anyways, so don’t fret if it misses out.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Cracovia vs Slask Wroclaw
Match Info: Part of the Great Triad vs the Kings of the Big Cities derby, this fixture could generate quite a lot of hype. There is another shout in Lechia vs Wisla Krakow, but the former matchup has the upperhand. Make sure to invest in those higher rated non-rare silvers, and always be conscious of selling into the hype.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 70 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
We were feeling good about last week, but alas our luck ran out. Can we start the streak again?
Nacional vs Millonarios (Cup Final)
Investing Strategies
It's that time. Remember to take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team on how to possibly make a few coins with would-be Marquee Matchups:

-- Prioritize investing in players who are members of the two teams featured in a specific Marquee Matchup (the higher rated, the better).
-- Non-Rare cards usually have a higher return on investment.
-- Certain positions such as LB/RB, CMs and STs are generally more profitable."

Two weeks after the last one, there's another forthcoming FIFA 18 title update. This one, already live for PC and anticipated for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in the next week or so, again skimps on any radical changes, and instead offers further iterative polish.
Amongst the new introductions, the FUT Champions Channel in the Weekend League sub-menus will now show more rage quits, your team will show up on the left in Team Management each time you play FUT Champs, and Pro Clubs friendlies now properly support extra time and penalties.
We told you it was a fairly bare bones update.
You can read all the latest title notes below. And since we seem on an every two-or-three-weeks title update pace, it's not out of the question we could see bigger and better in-game tweaks by or around Team of the Season:


        Hey FIFA Fans,

The latest title update for FIFA 18 is now available on PC.

This update includes the following:

Made the following changes in FIFA Ultimate team:

Matches that ended early will, in most cases, now be available for viewing in FUT Champions Channel.

Matches that end early due to a loss of connection by the home team will not be viewable.




Addressed the following issues in FIFA Ultimate team:

Custom kit numbers will no longer change after swapping players around in your squad.
Players will now always see their team on the left in the pre-match Team Management screens when playing a FUT Champions Weekend League match.
In FUT Champions Channel, the introduction of the Orbit camera in a previous update had inadvertently removed the slow (0.5x) playback speed. This has been added back as a playback option.
The Match Preview screen for FUT Champions Weekend League matches was sometimes showing the status of your opponent as blank instead of 'Making Changes'.
When an action shot on a player item fails to load, it will now properly default to the player's 2D portrait.
The wrong text was being highlighted in red, on player items, when a squad did not meet the requirements for the FUT Champions Daily Knockout Tournament due to either League or Nationality requirements.


Made the following changes in Online:

A Pro Clubs Friendlies match that is tied at the end of full time will now progress into extra time (silver goal) and, if needed, penalties.


Addressed the following issues in Online:

The on-screen pause button, when enabled through the Accessibility settings, was not working in Pro Clubs matches.


Made the following changes in Audio / Visual / Presentation:

Updates to the Catfish and the Bottlemen kit in FUT.


Thanks to those who’ve provided feedback. Throughout the course of the FIFA 18 season we'll provide you with more information and updates if and when they become available.

Market Overview
After a week of steady rise in the general Ultimate Team market, the Path to Glory sector exploded with almost every item seeing substantial price increases. Now, some of the price increases can be explained by looking at overall market trends; however, such a large uptick is also due to other factors as well. 
Taking a step back from the numbers, a big component of the PTG items’ price spike is tied to FUT investors speculating that these items will be needed as requirements for a Squad Builder Challenge soon, maybe even the highly anticipated/speculated Ones To Watch SBCs. Yet, the preceding thought is purely a guess which makes this week very risky and dangerous.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  With so many positive returns this week, most of these players are at their “high” points. That being said, it's still important to pay attention to big high/low differences since it in forms investors of where potential price could end up. So, be cautious with the likes of Emil Forsberg, Marcus Rashford and Danny Welbeck as they present high risk items.
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take:  A lot of similar looking volatilities this week, which is explained by the items all experiencing similar price trends. Gabriel Jesus stands out if you want to play with high volatility, but otherwise look to Tiemoue Bakayoko, Benedikt Howedes and Marquinhos for less risky picks.
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of a card to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Big beta figures this week, but the players who are most poised for price swings include the likes of Joe Hart, Alejandro Gomez and Marco Asensio. Make sure to monitor the overall FUT market as it will determine if the price swings are positive or negative. 
TOTW Shout 
Two Bayern players make the TOTW shouts list this week after their 5-2 victory. That being said Sandro Wagner is a major longshot, while Kingsley Coman is only a slightly better pick. The Frenchman has been receiving some TOTW hype amongst predictors though.
Big Winner - Kingsley Coman (Bayern Munich)
This doesn’t happen often, but Kingsley Coman finds himself as the big winner two weeks in a row. There were plenty of players with high returns, but Coman’s 80% makes him the king of the week.
Now the rise of the Frenchman’s price can be attributed to his solid performance over the weekend, but digging deeper into the stats can help one see if his price trend will continue upward. Looking at his weekly stats, an extremely high volatility (~28,000) but rather low beta of 0.31 suggest that Kingsley is in a state of limbo. His price has been rising dramatically over the past week, but it seems there is not much more room as demonstrated by his beta.
With the previous points in mind make sure to monitor his price, and selling into the hype might be the best call here. 
Big Loser - Raphael Varane (Real Madrid)
With only two players in the red this week, the decision for the biggest loser was not too difficult. It was further helped by the fact that Sane’s dip was largely due to an injury which means Raphael Varane finds himself as the biggest loser.  

Both volatility (~7,700) and beta 0.20 are on the lower side when compared to his price point, and these figures also suggest that Varane is in a precarious place. A low beta points to low mobility for the defender’s price unless he puts in an inform performance. Couple that with a tame volatility, and investors need to be weary that Raphael is a gamble on his real life performance rather than his FUT value. 
We want to say this is not a slight on Varane’s quality as a footballer, but be smart when considering Varane as a FUT investment because the stats aren’t too promising. 
Recap
Bringing the article to a close, this week was extremely exciting for the Path to Glory Market as most players skyrocketed in price! That being said, most of the rise is due to pure speculation on SBC requirements, and without any guarantee selling into the hype will help avoid the risk of disappointment. If there is no use for these items in the next week or two expect a huge price decline due to panic selling.           

Are you speculating on the PTG market? And expect a Ones To Watch update on Friday.

Xbox One champion Donovan 'DhTekKz' Hunt, just 16 years old, beat his PlayStation 4 counterpart Gonzalo Nicolas 'nicolas99fc' Villalba by an aggregate scoreline of 9-3 to win the Barcelona FUT Champions Cup Sunday. He'll take home 22,000 dollars and lay claim to being one of the top FIFA Ultimate Team players in the world.
""It doesn't feel like anything, cause it hasn't sunk in; I don't know what I've done. I'll wake up tomorrow and it'll be a different world for me,"" DhTekKz said immediately after winning his championship. 
After an astonishing run to the final, Hunt took a commanding two-goal lead in the first leg of the Grand Final within minutes. With a low, driven shot from right-hand side of goal, Hunt extended his lead to three through his Icon Thierry Henry right on the stroke of halftime. Villalba pushed for a comeback a few times, but as he's done throughout the tournament, Hunt's Team of the Year David De Gea came up with some massive saves to keep his clean sheet.
Villalba finally got on the board in the 81st minute, with a glancing header from Cristiano Ronaldo. He followed it up with another quick tally to make it 3-2, but his first leg comeback ended there. The second leg started shockingly similar to the first, with DhTekKz taking yet another 2-0 lead within the first few minutes, restoring his three-goal cushion. 
Viewers soon began to get a case of déjà vu, as another Ronaldo header snuck in past Villalba's Icon Lev Yashin. One more goal later, Hunt was sitting pretty at a 7-2 aggregate margin, but he kept his foot on the gas. A long-range shot made it a commanding 5-0 second-leg lead at halftime. The final aggregate scoreline was 9-3, but the result had long been decided.
Hunt, a college student at a very young age, rose to somewhat of a celebrity status over the course of today. The British teenager's name started trending on Twitter in the U.K. and Ireland, and he was even featured in a Twitter Moment, as he blazed through the Xbox One Knockout Stage en route to the cross-console Grand Final. His amazing run saw him beat Kurt Fenech, Hashtag United's 'Hashtag Ryan' Pessoa, and Michael 'VfL MegaBit' Bittner, the Xbox One No. 1 seed from the Group Stage.
Conversely, Villalba flew entirely under the radar before making the Grand Final. The Argentine, who demolished FC Basel's Tim 'TheStrxngeR' Katnawatos, 6-3, in the Playstation Final, placed in the top seven at last year's FIFA Interactive World Cup. His marquee win on the way to the Grand Final was over Kai 'Deto' Wollin, the 2017 FIWC runners-up, who he beat by a modest 3-1 margin. 
The final day began with more major upsets in the first round of the Knockout Stage alone. Schalke's Tim 'S04 Tim Latka' Schwartmann and Hashtag United's 'Hashtag Harry' Hesketh, both big names coming into the tournament, bowed out just moments in. On the other side, Wolfsburg's Timo 'iTimoX' Siep and Benedikt 'SaLz0r' Saltzer, who went undefeated in the Group Stage, RB Leipzig's Cihan Yasarlar, and Shaun 'xShellzz' Springette, the 2017 FIFA Ultimate Team Series runners-up, all exited in the Round of 32 as well.
Lukas 'Sakul' Vanderheide, the other competitor to finish the Group Stage with a 7-0 record, went on to win his first two elimination matchups before conceding to VfL MegaBit. Fenech, who was the first to qualify for the knockouts yesterday, scored nine to win his first matchup but only managed one in his second round loss to DhTekKz.
Reigning FIWC Champion Spencer 'Unilad Gorilla' Ealing advanced through to the quarter-finals before losing to Niklas 'NRaseck 7' Raseck. Gorilla's Round of 16 match against former Hashtag United man Tassal 'FaZe Tass' Rushan, which finished 11-8 to the former, was the most high-octane affair to watch. Tass edged Gorilla 5-4 in the first leg but a huge seven-goal effort in the second leg ensured the win for the 2017 Champion.
The tournament faced some more technical difficulties Sunday, as the PlayStation Network went down in the middle of the proceedings at arguably the most inopportune time. The rest of the games, after the console quarter-finals, were forced to be played on Xbox instead. The unfortunate situation was forced in all likelihood due to pre-existing broadcast arrangements and the lease on the facilities, plus travel logistics for the players tomorrow.
Manging his way through the extensive delays only fortified the impressivenes of DhTekKz's Sunday. The Grand Final started an hour later than it was supposed to be finishing originally, and TekKz had to cope with an extensive unplanned wait after his console final.
""I just kept walking everywhere to try and get it out of my mind -- and spoke to a few people,"" he said about how he tried to cope with the unplanned recess. ""My phone lost charge. It's a good thing it did. I didn't want to look at all the messages I was getting.""
But he did have some overwhelming moments in the build up that made him realize the magnitude of what was at hand as well. 
""Some guy, he played a voice message for me -- It was Thibaut Courtois wishing me good luck. It was amazing,"" he added, completely in awe of his journey.
The quarter-finalists on each console, i.e. the top eight from Xbox and Playstation, qualified for the Global Series playoff legs that will come later this year in June. The notable names among the qualifiers include Gorilla, Hashtag Ryan, Deto, Sakul, and Vfl Megabit. Of course, those who did not advance will get another chance, by finishing atop the February Weekend League leaderboards and qualifying for the next FUT Champions Cup.
The FIFA 18 Global Series will continue with the next FUT Champions Cup, which is scheduled to be held in April. Qualifying begins this coming weekend and takes place for the entirety of February."

Looking to the next couple of weeks, the Marquee Matchups pool will get a lot more interesting as international play dominates the football world. There are definitely some high profile fixtures. However, the real money will be in trying to get those fringe selections correct. So, with our crystal ball (and a little educated guessing), let's kick off this week’s predictions. 
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Germany vs Spain
Match Info:   A repeat of the Euro 2008 final, this match features high profile teams looking to stake their claims before the World Cup. Plenty of non-rares to go around, but try to find some players with good links between these two nations.  

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either nation 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Italy vs Argentina
Match Info:  These two nations represent football powerhouses, and although one is missing the World Cup, it should still be a dramatic fixture. Make sure to tune in and tune up with a couple non-rare pickups.  

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either nation


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Netherlands vs England
Match Info: Moving on to another matchup that features a prominent national side that wouldn’t be in Russia, this tie should also be a decent one. There's plenty of strong links in these nations to get you over the requirements.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each nation


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


France vs Colombia
Match Info: Time for EA to have a little fun with their selections. It wouldn’t be a conventional pick, yet in a week where it gets difficult to select sides with a lot of gold options, this game offers a life vest. Would love to see the sides created if this gets selected. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there tends to be some variance each week, let's take a look at some more outside the box picks that could make their way in:
Brazil vs Russia
Match Info:  This matchup was a tough one to demote to sleeper. Plenty of quality links between Brazilians and Russians in the Russian Premier league so make sure to jump on those. Should be profitable to sell into the hype here.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from each nation


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Chile vs Sweden 
Match Info: We’re getting a little stranger as we go down. This is a definition of a true sleeper, as these nations are just on the fringes and not receiving too much hype. Look to the highest rated non-rares you can, but also make sure they have good strong links, too.    

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each nation


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Portugal vs Netherlands
Match Info: Yes, it is unusual that we select a matchup that already features a team in another pick. However this one needs to be mentioned to hedge your bets. This fixture squeaks in at the end of the cycle, but could still warrant EA's selection. We like the other English-Dutch matchup better, but just be aware. 

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from each nation


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
Two for two the past couple of weeks, seems these come in spurts. Last big streak was three so we’re trying to at least match that, but this week might be difficult.  

Greece vs Switzerland

With plenty of big games to choose from we would love to hear your pick below! Also, feel free to share your thoughts on any games we missed."

Last week's score: 14/23

Formation: 3-4-1-2

Squad Link: http://www.futhead.com/18/squads/2752914/

Goalkeeper
Emiliano Viviano - GK - OVR 82
Roma's poor run of form continued with a 1-0 defeat at home to Sampdoria. It could have been a different story had Florenzi buried an early penalty but Viviano had other ideas making the save before producing eight other saves to keep his clean sheet intact. Quite the performance from the Italian. 
Defenders
Naldo - CB - OVR 82
The first of two Bundesliga CB's, both of which are very usable players, is Naldo. The Brazilian scored one of two Schalke goals as they went on to record a 2-0 away win over Stuttgart. At 6-foot-6 with solid pace, Naldo is a player which offers something different to the usual defenders.
Marcelo- LB - OVR 87
Although Marcelo has recently been in TOTY, the fact that his IF will be significantly lower than the TOTY item, I can't see it being a problem. The Brazilian scored one of four Real Madrid goals to help them on their way to a 4-1 win over Valencia, claiming MOTM in the process.
Jerome Boateng - CB - OVR 88
There are several options from Bayern Munich this week with Coman, Boateng and Lewandowski all making Kicker's TOTW. I am doing my usual and opting for the official MOTM though, which in this case is Boateng. The German defender scored one of five Munich goals in a 5-2 win over Hoffenheim.
Midfielders
Iago Falque - RW - OVR 80
Had the Premier league been in action Falque is one of those players who would have likely missed out on TOTW, but seeing as that’s not the case a goal and an assist becomes an attractive option. He received a modest 7/10 match rating for that contribution which came in Torino's 3-0 home win.
Samu Castillejo - CM - OVR 80
I fully expect at least one Villarreal IF on Wednesday, but as to who will be is up for debate. All three of Castillejo, Fornals and Bacca picked up three stars from Marca with a goal and an assist which makes it very difficult to determine who to select. I have gone with Castillejo simply due to the fact he played the furthest back.
Felipe Anderson - CAM - OVR 81
Although we saw Lazio lose to AC Milan this weekend they also played mid-week in which they recorded a 3-0 win over Udinese. From that match Felipe Anderson occurs, scoring one and assisting another from the role just off the striker.
Angel Di Maria - RW - OVR 85
Di Maria was very unfortunate not to pick up a TOTW item last week with two goals and an assist, but Neymar's dominance saw him thwarted. He makes another case this week for his goal in PSG's 4-0 win which saw him pick up MOTM with an 8/10 from L'equipe. With the lack of PL coming into the equation it makes Di Maria a strong contender for the side.
Quaresma - RM - OVR 83
This is almost an identical situation to what we had with Quagliarella and Ramirez last week and had Tallisca not been in TOTW last week I would have been selecting him here  after he scored both Besiktas goals. Instead we have Quaresma who was a constant threat down the wing putting in cross after cross which ended up with him picking up both the assists.
Forwards
Nils Petersen - ST - OVR 76
Although three points were snatched from Freiburg in the dying embers of the game, Petersen's brace was enough to see him named POTW in Germany. After all, two goals against Dortmund is still impressive whether you win or draw the match. The POTW award pretty much solidifies his spot here.
Dries Mertens - ST - OVR 86
In a usual week I wouldn’t go near a TIF Mertens after two goals but with a lack of options, particularly in forward options. Due to that his brace could well be enough, seeing as there has been a thirteen-week gap since the last Mertens IF.
Substitutes
Marwin Hitz - GK - OVR 79
I struggled to select a sub keeper and thus as is often the case I have taken Kickers keeper, which on this occasion was Hitz. The Augsburg keeper made four saves in their 1-1 draw which saw him pick up keeper of the week.
Rafael Toloi - CB - OVR 77
Although it was his defensive partner who scored one of Atlanta's three goals, Toloi was the player who stood out at the back. His defensive contribution to the side saw him claim MOTM while helping to preserve their clean sheet. A 3-0 away win is huge to Atlanta's hopes of European football.
Steven Beghuis - RW - OVR 76
It's simply ridiculous that Berghuis is still without an IF this year, the Feyenoord winger impresses week in week out and with another POTW performance to his name surely this will finally be the week. He scored one and assisted another two  which takes his tally to twelve goals and eight assists for the season.
Diego Castro - CAM - OVR 76
Diego Castro was a player who was seemingly always in contention last year and although he ended up picking up just the two special items it really could have been a whole lot more. This is the first time I have noticed him for FIFA 18 though and with two goals and an assist to his name he is almost certainly picking up his first.
Edin Viscaa - RM - OVR 79
A late addition to the side now with Visca after his two goals and two assists helped guide Basaksehir to a 5-0 home win. With the flurry of Monday additions in recent weeks I would be surprised to see this one overlooked.
Sofiane Hanni - ST - OVR 77
It was an exciting match to say the least when Liege hosted Anderlecht this weekend. When you see Anderlecht with three goals to their name you fully expect them to come out with the win but Liege more than held their own with three of their own. I am still predicting the Anderlecht IF after Hanni scored all three of their goals.
Fabricio - ST - OVR 67
Although it’s not often that non-gold player sneak onto the subs bench it does sometimes happen and with next to no options in the gold striker front it gives the opportunity for it to occur. Fabrico comes from a Monday evening match after he scored three and assisted another in a 4-1 win.
Reserves
Scott McKenna - CB - OVR 59
Several defenders picked up multiple attacking contributions this week and thus it makes it a difficult decision to make, it could go several ways, but I am opting for McKenna who scored twice in Aberdeen's 3-1 win.
Wlademar Sobota - LM - OVR 71
There is always an additional risk when it comes to predicting mid-week games, especially when they come from a lower league. With I am still more than willing to take the punt on Sobota after his two goals and an assist.
Nolan Roux - LM - OVR 73
There were several silvers who could be included from France this week, but none are better than Roux who scored twice for Metz in their 2-1 win over Nice.
De Tomas - ST - OVR 72
It's been a while since we have seen a silver or bronze hat trick and from my point of view it has made proceedings significantly harder in terms of predicting. Finally, we are back within the hat tricks though after De Tomas scored three of his sides five goals in a convincing 5-1 home win.
Moise Kean - ST - OVR 64
Moise Kean is a name everyone needs to remember, the talented young striker is likely to become a huge star in the coming years. On loan from Juventus the 17-year-old is playing in the top division for Hellas Verona which at that age is something to be proud of. He scored twice against Fiorentina this week in a shock 4-1 win, claiming player of the week in the process."

Market Overview
What a week for Path to Glory items! After some late rumors emerged about a second batch of these dynamic items, EA delivered with a stacked 23 man lineup. To go along with the new items, EA released a set of Path to Glory SBCs that mirrored the Ones to Watch promo in early February. These new SBCs caused the market to go crazy, with high-rated items (icons & informs) dropping significantly, while 82-84s rose sharply due to SBC requirements.
Taking a closer look at the hype driver of the FUT market, the “Autumn” PTG items’ returns look unrealistic. More than three-fourths of the items have above a 100% weekly return, but that is what FUT market hype can do. Hopefully you cashed in on your investments, but if you’re still holding you are playing with fire. Make sure to sell as these items will plummet once the PTG SBCs are done! 
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  With the statistics so skewed this week, looking at the high/low spread can show you where cards will fall back to.If next week they fall below their lows it could be profitable to pick them up and flip them as people might panic too hard. 
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take: Another section where the numbers are off the charts. Chalk this up to the hype of course; however, watch for the players with higher volatility like Dimitri Payet, Lars Stindl and Sandro Wagner to fall the hardest.      

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Make it three for three on sections that are abnormal this week. Similar to volatility, look to players like Emil Forsberg, Stephan El Shaarawy and Marquinhos, who all sport high betas, to drop significantly in the week to come. 

TOTW & Upgrade Shout 
Amidst all the PTG promotion hype, a couple marquee players put in quality performances that have them looking good for the upcoming TOTW. Marcus Rashford netted a brace in their huge fixture over the weekend, while Rodrigo also found the back of the net twice. 
Both players would be highly sought after cough pace cough, but selling into the hype is not a bad option (especially for Rodrigo).

Big Winner - 82-84 rated items & Gabriel Jesus (Manchester City)
Looking at the Weekly Statistic it’s clear that any PTG item rated 82-84 saw insane price increases. It was great for investors, but seriously remember these 82-84 items will plummet in the coming weeks.

With that in mind, we had to choose another big winner, and Gabriel Jesus emerged as our hero. The Brazilian had a solid week of returns on his own, and that may be due to some external factors. After returning from injury, Jesus grabbed a goal in their UEFA Champions League tie last week which is a promising sign. But, what really kicked up his hype was the unfortunate news that Aguero will be sidelined for two weeks. Without competition for the starting forward spot Jesus has a tremendous opportunity to shine in one of the best attacking sides in the Premier League. 
A lot of things seem to be lining up for Jesus, and his hype potential is enormous. Another inform and this card would be game breaking, so watch this space. 

Big Loser -  Raphael Varane (Real Madrid)
With only three PTG players having negative weekly returns, the biggest loser pool was limited. So, it didn’t take us long to stumble upon Raphael Varane as our biggest loser; however, there could be a major silver lining here. 
With the domestic seasons ending it's important to note that dynamic players will start losing value as the lower the number of fixtures the less chances for an upgrade. It should be noted that PTG items will get upgraded if they pick up informs/upgrades in the summer; however, the risk is still to high for prices to hold at there current levels. So where is Varane’s silver lining? 
With Real Madrid still active in a variety of competitions, the Frenchman looks to be one of the better picks from the “Autumn” PTG items. He gets quality minutes at the back, plus he has high hype potential. If he can pick up an inform or MOTM his stats would be incredible and serve as a tidy FUT Champs player. This means there is a high reward to the high risk you take on his item.

Recap
The PTG market finally got the hype it deserves! Make sure you have cashed in completely as these players prices will plummet when the SBCs are gone! Don’t get greedy, and take the profit now as there are better investment opportunities on the horizon. Look out for the new batch of PTG items to join the analysis next week, but in the meantime revel in the profit.              

We finally got the answer to our question of when PTG items would be needed; however, our new question is which PTG player are you looking forward to using the most? As always, lookout for some more dynamic item analysis in our Ones to Watch market update later in the week.

A pair of new Prime Icons have entered the FIFA Ultimate Team ecosystem.
While outside of 'Calcio A'/Italy partisans, you're probably not going to see a ton of 90-overall Filippo Inzaghi's out there, his untradeable item is obaintable through a Squad Building Challenge, effective immediately. It's also packable for the rest of FIFA 18. A loan version is obtainable through a ~10K SBC for the next week.
The big headliner from today's Throwback Thursday action has to be former Eintracht Frankfurt, Fenerbache, PSG, and Bolton Wanderers standout, Jay-Jay Okocha. The Nigerian legend (and uncle of current Arsenal player Alex Iwobi) gets his first central item, as a CAM, and with five-star skills and a four-star weak foot, particularly at an expectedly reasonable price to complete, could become a favorite for some. Like Inzaghi, a loan version of the Okocha SBC is available for the next week.

Market Overview
As the Ratings Refresh promotion came to an end, the general FUT market continued on its usual trend when in between big content events. The trend we’ve seen is a dip post-Weekend League, leading to a stable rise from Monday to Thursday as people ramp up for competitive play. We thought it was about time we covered that trend, but the release of sPOTM Mohamed Salah, and ton of hype around a new batch of dynamic player items has the market in an interesting position. Time will tell, but the market is poised for some big swings in a busy March. 
Now, turning our attention to a sector of the FUT market that everyone loves, Ones to Watch items had a really solid week on the back of a couple big Team of the Week shouts. An even bigger brightspot was the fact that some Winter OTW players finally received positive weekly returns, while others seem to be stabilizing out. This next month will be huge for these items, so keep reading to help you gain some knowledge on how to amass your FUT fortune. 
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats



The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data that I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:   Coming at you hot with the players who are showing the best hype potential due to their high/low spread, it seems like Nicolas Tagliafico, Alexis Sanchez and James Rodriguez fit the bill here. Plenty of options to choose from, but when you’re looking to make a high upside pick, look at players with large high/low ranges who just experienced a negative weekly return; price might be cheap. 
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take: Neymar takes the cake with his figures this week, which helps to explain his 300k lose in value due to his unfortunate injury, and subsequent surgery. Hope he recovers quickly, but some more abnormal figures that stand out are Virgil Van Dijk and Federico Bernardeschi. Both players have been experiencing large daily price swings, so if you can time it right enjoy the coins
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Summer OTW items are surprisingly tame this week, which speaks to them being mostly stable at the moment. However, their Winter counterparts seemingly have much more sensitive figures. The likes of Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Aymeric Laporte and Khouma Babacar all seemed to be poised to have big price swings depending on the market’s direction.

TOTW Shout
A week with two main inform shouts saw Ederson Moraes receive a TOTW nod, while Corentin Tolisso was snuffed after scoring a screamer. Luckily, a couple more months of football will hopefully see this section staying filled out. 
In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner - Ederson Moraes (Manchester City)
Touched on briefly above, the Man City shot stopper had a quality week which saw him earn a second inform. At 87 overall, this item is a beast between the stick, and to top it off Ederson finds himself as this week's biggest winner. 
Some crazy weekly stats, the Brazilian boosted a 70.6% weekly return with a huge volatility (~20,000) as hype carried his price up all week. As usual though, selling OTW items into the hype is the way to go! After his TOTW inclusion Ederson’s price has slowly receded alongside the new inform, so if you held (besides to play with) you missed out on a few coins. 
Make sure to keep that trend in mind going forward, because with domestic seasons winding down, and Team of the Season approaching, it’s time to maximize those coins.

Big Loser - Keita Balde Diao (AS Monaco) 
Choosing the player to represent this category wasn't as difficult as the past few weeks; however, it still wasn't easy. This week we came to the consensus that after a week of rough returns, Keita Balde Diao was our biggest loser. 
The speedy attacker has struggled with consistent game time, and when he has features just seems to miss out on all the things that would hype him up in FUT. Interestingly, his volatility and beta are both rather low, which demonstrates he might be reaching his risk free point. His blistering pace and relatively high rating should keep his price around 20k going forward, so if you can swoop in there is definitely hype potential here!

Keep your eyes on Keita as he might not be down and out just yet.
Recap & outlook
A lull between promotions saw the price in the general FUT market rise and fall due to Weekend League hype, but looking forward there are plenty of promotions that could shake up the market. Ones to Watch still hold relevance due to hype around their performances, as evident by the TOTW shouts, so make sure you are trying to maximize coins down the stretch. Finally, here’s some quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Winter OTWs could finally be settling, so if you can get in on some open bids, you could make a decent profit flipping overnight.     

-- OTW investors: It's getting to a point where you need to be watching your items for any spike in price, because as domestic seasons wind down risk goes up!
We would love to know who has been the best OTW item you’ve used this FIFA?  Also, if you can’t get enough market analysis check out our latest Path to Glory update!

The final Team of the Week of January 2018 is here.
It's got a few gems up top, undoubtedly. But the overall strength of the squad? Well, let's just say we've seen better in the not-too-distant past.
That said, if you're going to be ripping some Winter Ones to Watch packs -- which starts this coming Friday, 2 February -- in those you've got a shot at the likes of 89 Jerome Boateng, Kicker's MOTM from Bayern's come from behind win this past week, 91 Toni Kroos (who ripped a banger from 20 meters out), as well as 89 ST Dries Mertens, who's coming off another Man of the Match for a brace and his general quality.
If you're looking for a hidden gem this week, you may have to dig real deep. Juventus sensation (and Hellas Veronas loanee) Moise Kean getting his first of potentially very many FIFA Ultimate Team in-forms might be a shout for 'Calcio A' squad builders looking for an Alex Hunter type.
As per usual, here's the full FIFA Ultimate Team Team of the Week 20:"

Overview & Release Dates
As the deadline ticked to a close, one couldn't help but think: What a transfer window! Big deals galore, but a few low profile moves have us wondering who will be the real winner when the dust settles? Well, to answer that question I guess we, the FUT players, will be the true winners. 
Last year EA surprised us a bit with a Winter Ones to Watch (OTW) squad, and this year will be no different. After confirming three items already, we should expect the full team to be released Friday (Feb 2). Now that we have a date in mind the only thing left to do is what we do best: make predictions.
Our predictions
Since we already recieved a full 23 man squad of One to Watch items at the beginning of FIFA 18, there is a precedence upon which to base these predictions. There was a mix of low rated youngster with high upside, but EA also inculded some big name verterans looking to start a new chapter in their career. So, with that sort of diversity in mind we picked through the long list of transfers to deliver our picks. 
Confirmed OTWs

PLAYER BREAKDOWNS
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - Arsenal


Bio: A true FUT legend and deadline day deal. Woe is us for seeing the Gabonese striker in every weekend league side from here on out. 


Outlook: He has the pace and size to dominate the BPL, but Arsenal’s attack was not necessarily its issue. I'm sure he’ll pick up an inform at some point though. 



Diego Costa- Atletico Madrid


Bio: Everyone’s favorite bristly Spanish striker has finally returned to playing football. Although he has been with the Madrid side most of the season, he has only recently returned to action and warrants a OTW spot.



Outlook: Costa has already been scoring goals for his new (or old) club, and since he has already bossed Liga Santander once, he should be able to do it again



Aymeric Laporte - Manchester City


Bio: City went with another big money move for a French defender, which puts Laporte as one of the top picks to fill out the January OTW squad. We all hope he doesn’t get snubbed like Mendy, while also avoiding his compatriots fate, too. 


Outlook: I have been a fan of Laporte for a while, and he has the skill set and intelligence to succeed; however, we must consider that their blistering attack could overshadow the new guy. 



Virgil Van Dijk - Liverpool


Bio: The man who warranted the record breaking transfer fee for a defender should surely find himself on the list for a OTW item. As a transfer that almost went through in the summer I am sure EA already have this item drawn up. 


Outlook: Loads of potential, but Liverpool back line is as consistent as the EA servers. That being said, the hype around this card will be massive if he scores a goal!



Joao Mario - West Ham


Bio: Yes, the top of the prediction is dominated by BPL players; however, the Portuguese midfield man makes a high profile loan move to Hammers. At 83 overall, he would be one of the higher rated OTW candidates, and could be a tidy investment option. 


Outlook: Just last year he was tipped as one of the best young midfield players in Europe, but after sputtering a little this season he has a lot to prove. Another player with the physical tools to succeed, but will he be able to adapt quickly? 



Inigo Martinez - Athletic Bilbao


Bio: Brought in as the replacement for Laporte, Inigo himself is a quality Center Half. He would be a nice diverse option outside of the Premier League, and with an inform already he’s got a solid track record for EA to consider.



Outlook: Definitely a promising young defender, but like all backline players will he muster up a goal or assist to warrant an upgrade? 



Gerard Deulofeu - Watford


Bio: Will lightning strike twice for OTW items? The speedy Spanish winger picked up a OTW item last year during the Winter OTW squad, and he is poised for another one.


Outlook: Lets hope he doesn’t have a similar experience like the Watford OTW last year, looking at you Niang.



Daniel Sturridge - West Brom


Bio: The Sturridge transfer saga received quite a lot of media attention, and since he does have a solid FUT history it would be pretty surprising if he was overlooked. There is a lot of hype around him trying to make the England WC squad, so in a way he is one to watch.



Outlook: There are a myriad of questions around if Sturridge can return to the 2013/14 form, but after injuries and a lack of playtime I’m leaning more pessimistic here.



Roque Mesa - Sevilla


Bio: After a pretty weak first half of the season with Swansea, Mesa is one of the weaker links here. That being said who can pass up on that mustache?   



Outlook: He dominated in Spain last year and with a quality side around him, this defensive midfield definitely has potential.



Lucas Moura - Tottenham


Bio: Remember when the man from Sao Paulo was supposed to be Neymar’s rival? It hasn’t necessarily panned out for Lucas, but a move to a side with great attacking options could be just what the Brazilian needs. 


Outlook: Plenty of pace and not too much right wing competition sets up the ex-PSG man nicely, but will his lack of physicality bite him in the end?



Marc Bartra - Real Betis


Bio: A rather unexpected transfer, Bartra has quite a lot of hype and potential. The only doubt I have here is if EA overlook Betis as a club, but otherwise he fits the bill. 


Outlook: He had a good run in La Liga with Barcelona, yet this time he will be slotted into a side with a little less talent... 



Ross Barkley - Chelsea


Bio: Another deal on the weird spectrum, but EA love themselves some Englishmen especially at a club like Chelsea. At the very least it will be interesting to see where Conte plays him. 


Outlook: The kid has talent, but he finds himself as a rotation player which means he may only be useful when Chelsea are resting for the UCL.




Theo Walcott- Everton


Bio: The pace demon of old seems to be revived. At the time of the article he already grabbed a brace. He is a little on the old side, but it would be a shame if he was overlooked..



Outlook: The rapid winger is already proven in the PL, and with increased game time he might be able to finally shine.



Rafinha - Inter Milan


Bio: Serie A clubs were more inclined to sell this window, but Inter decided to swoop for this Barca midfielder. He is still young, and his flair could make him an interesting watch in Italy. 


Outlook: As a OTW item he could stay on the cheap side, yet that might make him a great pickup since its these type of players that sneak a few informs 



Nicolas Tagliafico - Ajax


Bio: One of the items that I have a little more bias towards, but I would love to see the Argentine LB feature. It would give some much need recognition to the Eredivisie, while also satisfying some outside back spots. 


Outlook: Plenty of fixtures left against lesser opponents, which bodes well for the Ajax man to keep his value going forward.




Kenneth Vermeer - Club Brugge


Bio: Not too many GKs to choose from, but the side must have one. The relatively small Dutch man presents the most compelling case, but I am definitely open to suggestions here.


Outlook: Honestly not sure how much value this card would have considering he's an undersized keeper in an off league. 



Cenk Tosun - Everton


Bio: The Turkish striker made a name for himself in his Champions League group, and after a move to Everton he should pick up a OTW item. His rating is on the low end, but that might make him attractive as an affordable option. 


Outlook: Everton really boosted their attacking options this window, and Tosun could be the out-and-out striker they need. However, people were also optimistic about their summer window, and we saw how that turned out.




Miguel Layun - Sevilla


Bio: Getting into some of the lower rated options here, but the Mexican wingback used to destroy at Porto. I am sure many North American fans are eager to see how he cuts it in a top 5 league.



Outlook: Although he experienced quite the pace cut, if he picks up a couple informs he could be a real beast. That’s a big ifs though.




Terence Kongolo - Huddersfield Town


Bio: Just a few months after joining Monaco, Kongolo hopped over to England. Being a youngster with a ton of potential he should warrant an inclusion as a Winter OTW . 


Outlook: If EA get cheeky and release this card as a CB (where he's been playing) then he’s a great shout. If they keep him at LB, then meh. 



Additional Possibilities
There were a ton of transfers that narrowly miss out on this side including the likes of Michy Batshuayi, Arda Turan, Jurgen Locadia, Guido Carrillo & Marko Pjaca to name a few. Personally, I am also holding out hope for the likes of Yerry Mina or Ousmane Dembele.

Another solid week of predictions sees just eight players missed from TOTW 25 and we have a big one too, in the form of Leroy Sane, who is probably the most in form winger on the planet right now. Plus we check out the opening week of the MLS and some goalkeeping heroics from the Liga MX. 
Leroy Sane - LW - Man City
With two matches potentially in the mix for City this week, and given their imperious form they were likely to snag a few IFs. However, we missed Leroy Sane who scored one and assisted another against Arsenal in their 3-0 win on Thursday night. Sane was less impactful in the Sunday game against Chelsea, but if there’s a winger in form right now in the EPL. it’s Sane. 
Aaron's View: *A goal and an assist for a City player is often enough for a TOTW entry but with Ederson already in the side I couldn't justify a second City player. *
Hector Moreno - CB - Real Sociedad
Real Sociedad are reasonably comfortable in La Liga currently occupying 15th place, but they will need to secure a few more wins this season to not risk a relegation battle. The latest points came from a 2-1 win against Alaves where both goals for the home side were scored in the first ten minutes. Hector Moreno scored the opener but with no clean sheet this is a tough one to predict. 
Aaron's View: The two-star match rating for Moreno put me off, especially when several other players picked up the maximum three stars from La Liga this week. 
Matt Lowton - RB - Burnley
Burnley are doing their level best to chase down Arsenal in 6th place, and a 2-1 win against Everton (whilst Arsenal lost) was just the tonic they needed. TOTW IF fullback Matt Lowton played well in this one but only recorded a single assist for Ashley Barnes. Along with Moreno the lack of clean sheet to go with the goal or assist makes this a tough one for predictions. 
Aaron's View: This is one I just don't understand. Burnley scraped a 2-1 win from which Lowton assisted one of the goals. Surely Dunk who scored one in a 2-1 win over Arsenal is the better option?
Tiago Volpi - GK - Querétaro
However, if Lowton and Moreno were difficult to pick-up the same cannot be said for Tiago Volpi who put in a magnificent goalkeeping display for Querétaro against Cruz Azul in the Liga MX. Querétaro picked up the 1-0 win, but it was all thanks to Volpi who made seven saves including a penalty to deny Cruz Azul’s forward line. Great performance. 
Aaron's View:  Seven saves with a penalty included looks like an obvious miss but with Ederson and Alisson both picking up huge match ratings, I couldn't ignore either. Alisson is the unfortunate player who misses out.
Leo Dubois - RB - FC Nantes
Sometimes amazing performances get you in to the TOTW and sometimes amazing goals do, and the latter was certainly the case for Leo Dubois who after starting the move from his own half, popped up later to rifle home FC Nante’s opener from the edge of the box against Marseille. However, the result was taken away from them right at the end as Florian Thauvin equalised in the 94th minute. 
Aaron's View: I almost selected Dubois, however it would have been over Traore who also got in to the TOTW. I tried to be clever with Rugani and Mariano, who were my other choices for this spot. Turned out not to be the case.
Valeri Qazaishvili - LM - San Jose Earthquakes
The MLS is back and with it comes a guaranteed day one IF, for which we get Valeri Qazaishvili who scored one and assisted two others for the San Jose Earthquakes against Minnesota United. Danny Hosen was the recipient of those assists and even after a late flurry of goals from Minnesota, San Jose held on for the 3-2 win. 
Aaron's View: The midfield was packed this week which made proceedings very difficult, the MLS starting seemingly helped Qaz despite a goal and two assists looking good on paper.
Sofiane Feghouli - RW - Galatasaray
When a team win 7-0, predicting in forms gets very tricky and as such we missed Feghouli and his three assists in Galatasaray’s thumping victory against Kardemir. Gomis scored four but with an IF for him last week he was exempt which made it a straight shootout between two players which Aaron will explain. That win keeps Gala top and provides a healthy goal difference boost. 
Aaron's View: I opted for team mate Mariano getting this spot after recording two assists (one less than Feghouli), mainly due to how many midfielder options there were in comparison to defenders this week.
Bryan Linssen - LM - Vitesse
Vitesse took on the mighty Ajax in the Eredivisie and put in a fantastic home performance to win 3-2. Bryan Linssen scored two second half goals in twenty minutes to push the score out to 3-1 before Sim De Jong made it a nervy last five minutes for the hosts. But, Vitesse held on and Linssen makes the TOTW. Good times all-round.

Aaron's View: We end with another cheap inclusion. Linssen played well, but with six silver or bronze hat tricks coming in this week, I don't feel that you can justify his selection."

Following the much anticipated Team of the Year comes the return of two former Ballon d’Or winners and the first 92 Midfielder in a revamped version of one of FIFA Mobile Season 1’s most loved promotions, End of an Era. Featuring recently retired players, last year’s popular End of an Era featured greats such as Lahm, Alonso, and Totti, however, this season’s iteration comes much earlier in the calendar, meaning players retiring at the conclusion of the 2017/2018 season or after the World Cup miss out this time around. Whether these players feature in an end of the season End of an Era remains to be seen, but that takes nothing away from another exciting promo featuring something for everyone.
The Players
Hot on the heels of the two currently active Ballon d’Or winners’ Team of the Year items we see one of the last four active Ballon d’Or winner Ricardo Kaká grace the stage as a 92 CAM reminiscent of his AC Milan days. As a testimony to Messi and Ronaldo’s dominance, when Kaká won his Ballon d’Or in 2007 there were 9 former Ballon d’Or winners still active - Rivaldo, Luís Figo, Michael Owen, Ronaldo Nazário, Pavel Nedved, Andriy Shevchenko, Ronaldinho and Fabio Cannavaro, eight of whom have since become Legends and/or Icons. Headlining with EoE Kaká is another former Milan player, Andrea Pirlo. Already rewarded for his lavish career on console with a Premium SBC, Pirlo’s 91 CDM will remind returning players of his Season 1 LVL Master item.
The Little Mozart Tomáš Rosický’s 87 CAM is a fitting tribute to the former Arsenal midfield general, while previously voted Community Favourite and longtime Swedish lynchpin Kim Källström returns as an 85 CM. Former Napoli stalwart Paolo Cannavaro - Fabio’s younger brother - showcases an 83 CB, and 3-time Ligue 1 Team of the Year veteran Benoît Cheyrou’s well-rounded 82 CDM completes the Season 2 End of an Era lineup.
With the release of the formidable (and expensive) 98 CDM Lothar Matthaüs during Team of the Year, the last Ballon d’Or winner to officially retire has a second Icon card released, this time as a 98 CAM Prime Ronaldinho. With a maximum 120 in thirteen of the twenty outfielder stats, the requirements are heavy once again for this ultimate status symbol. Ronaldinho’s regular 89 Icon item released back in November and set to be rereleased in the coming weeks pales in comparison to an item that requires collecting a hefty 800 EoE points, and a 115 OVR squad with 4 of the 6 EoE players in your Starting XI.
All 7 EoE players utilise the new Captain Skill Boost which boosts 5 key stats in Short Passing, Dribbling, Acceleration, Marking, and Ball Control. This will mean more Skill Boost packs to obtain this new boost, however the all roundedness of the Captain Boost means any position in your Starting XI could end up utilising it.
How does End of an Era work?
End of an Era points return in LVL packs, a move welcomed in Season 1 and very much so this season too. A LVL win earns 6 EoE points, a draw gives 4, and a loss gives 2. You can also earn EoE points through VSA matches within the EoE chapter under the Events tab. Similar to Weekend Tournaments, you earn EoE points and fans when you win a match through the EoE chapter. There are up to 4 matches available every 6 hours, one match is automatically unlocked that rewards 2 EoE points, and the remaining three unlock according to your VSA Division with thresholds at World Class III, Legendary III, and FIFA Champion. The three unlockable matches reward one EoE point each, for 5 EoE points total every 6 hours. This should provide incentive to VSA ‘campers’ to push up to FIFA Champion.
Players have an End of an Era level which utilises EoE points as experience points. The more EoE points you collect, the higher your EoE level will get. Nodes in the EoE Chapter have EoE level requirements and give rewards once you have accumulated enough EoE points.
The Standard Path in the EoE Chapter offers plentiful rewards for free-to-play players, 640 Skill Boosts (including a guaranteed 20 Captain’s Boosts), 75k coins, 370k regular XP, 500FP, a January PotM point at Level 9, a random Team Hero at Level 17, and EoE Cannavaro.
An EoE Pass is available in the store for an initial £0.99, followed by a 500FP pack containing Benoît Cheyrou and his associated logo, then a 1500FP pack that unlocks the EoE Premium Path. The Premium Path contains rewards for every level including a new kit at Level 15, and 92 CAM Kaká at Level 20. With 4 million coins, 600k regular XP, 1.35 million EoE XP, 950 Skill Boosts (including 100 guaranteed Captain’s Boosts), EoE Källstrom and EoE Rosický, the Premium Path will reward those dedicated enough to grind their way through this event. Like the Football Freeze calendar Doubler, the EoE Pass will remain throughout the event, allowing you to purchase it at a later date and still receive all the Premium Rewards you have missed out on.
Added to the end of the Chapter are Bonus rewards. 1 million coins, 50 Captain’s Boosts, and EoE Andrea Pirlo are up for grabs under the Standard Bonuses. However, Pirlo requires 250 EoE points and a 90 OVR Squad with at least one EoE player. You can pick up EoE Cannavaro at Level 13 (90 EoE points) along the Standard Path, who has the distinction of being one of the few CBs able to Rainbow Flick at 100 OVR.
The Premium Bonus rewards ramp up the heat, for virtually the same requirements as Pirlo (250 EoE Points, and a 95 OVR squad with 2 EoE players is needed), you can get 150 Captain’s Boosts, 5 million coins, and 1 million regular XP. 300 EoE Points. 
100 OVR and 3 EoE players lands you 2,500 SBs, and finally a massive 800 EoE Points, 115 OVR and 4 EoE players will earn you Prime Icon Ronaldinho and a Ronaldinho 10 Barcelona logo. The Premium Bonus rewards require the EoE Pass however.
There are 286 EoE points up for grabs throughout the event, with more available through the store as FP packs. EoE Levels require 6 points/Level for the first 10, followed by 10 points/Level for the last 10, meaning just 160 points and the EoE Pass are needed for Kaká. This also means the £19.99 Level Up packs should only be bought when you are at least EoE Level 10 and are exactly 10 EoE points away from a Level Up for maximum value.
With the refresh timer coinciding with TotW, End of an Era has a much lower time requirement than Team of the Year.
Summary
A very profitable program once again, rewarding some stalwarts of the modern game with their last cards in FIFA Mobile Season 2. With lots of Skill Boosts, XP and coins up for grabs, End of an Era follows some very successful promotions from the EA team."

After an unexpected week off last Thursday (which in fairness, could have been just as much to do with server issues plaguing companies like Electronic Arts, Blizzard, and others due to a data center outage as scheduling) FIFA 18's Throwback Thursdays are back.
Yeah, yeah; these aren't the wildest, sexiest Prime Icons you'll see this FUT -- but the good news is three more off the docket means we're another week closer to getting those. We fully expect Pele, Ronaldo ""R9"" Nazario, and the full set of Prime Icons out in the next month or so as Team of the Season arrives.
In the meantime, today's release sees FUT sleeper favorite Hernan Crespo's highest rated Icon/Legend item. At four-star skills/four-star weak foot, with passable stamina, and a solid mix of Pace, Shooting, and Physical ratings, he could be an ""affordable"" (at least as far as Prime Icons go) untradeable Squad Building Challenges option or purchase/rental from the Transfer Market.
This one isn't blowing minds on social media either, but as a champion of his 90-rated version, I'm personally looking forward to giving Alessandro Nesta's best ever FUT item a test drive (SBC viewable here). The low pace is off-putting relative to other high-end centerback items, but for whateve reason, his mid-tier Icon always just way outperformed its ratings for me.
Finally, a 90-rated Jari Litmanen rounds out the group. Other than for Ajax or Finnish football fans, it probably isn't going to be must have, but represents a nice additions to packs if nothing else. The SBC will probably wind up being relatively cheap, too.
The SBCs are available as of 6 p.m. UK time Thursday along with 20-match loan versions of each for a week. Tradeable versions will be available in packs and on the Transfer Market for the rest of this FUT, too.
Perhaps most interestingly, EA also dropped a boatload of new Upgrade SBCs (including one with a guanteed Base Icon). These run for the next two weeks, which could run in parallel with several promos (Saint Patrick's Day and FUT Birthday have both been hypothesized).
Know the player items are not universally considered world beaters or anything, but are you looking forward to any of these specific Prime Icons?"

Should Cristiano Ronaldo get an upgraded card in FIFA 18? How about Dele Alli? Or Robert Lewandowski? You’ve speculated about it on the internet for months on end.
In EA SPORTS’ first wave of FIFA 18 player ratings reveal, they have professional footballers react to your comments on Futhead and elsewhere about their ratings and other FIFA antics. 
Check out the video below to see what Ronaldo thinks his player rating should be and to see Lewandowski learn what a dab is from teammate Mats Hummels.

Surprise! Let the hype begin.
While there'd been some buzz we might see a second set of Path to Glory items, e.g. dynamic player items that get better with each special item a player gets (pre-TOTS) based around players trying to make the cup for their country's World Cup squads, who knew the group would look like this.
A 92 right-out-the-gates Gonzalo Higuain (shades of his Ones to Watch from FUT 17) is joined by FIFA 18 meta star Sergej Milinkovic-Savic in a fairly loaded group of far more a-listers than the Autumn release. Thiago, Mauro Icardi, Isco, Raheem Sterling, Alex Sandro, Willian, Roberto Firmino and many others fill out the bunch.
Similar to the Winter OTW release, there are loads of new Squad Buildling Challenges available for the next week, including tradeable and untradeable versions of both a Autumn and Spring Path to Glory SBC. It's a pretty safe assumption we'll see special packs and Lightning Rounds for the better part of the weekend as well.
You can check out all the Winter and Spring Path To Glory items on Futhead's PTG landing page."

20 days till FIFA 18 (and around six fewer, give or take, if you're fortunate enough to have an Xbox One and be a subscriber to EA Access).
With that looming over us, we take a gander over at what should be one of the final Teams of the Week for FIFA Ultimate Team 17.
There's a few big names, a legend on FUT only, and a few debate starting choices (and ommissions; like, what does Romelu Lukaku have to do to get a Manchester United in-form?)
81 RM Marcus Rashford will be equal parts welcome and frustrating. But as it's collectors primarily only still on the TOTW grind, perhaps it's not too big of a deal. Long time FUT icon, the Sweat Lord Seydou Doumbia gets a Sporting CP IF to cap 17. And hey, a few walkouts in Spurs' Christian Eriksen and FC Bayern's Mats Hummels. Double decent.
Here's the complete TOTW 51:"

Alex Hunter's next step is almost here.
With ""FIFA 18"" -- and the second chapter of our, well, journey, with the series' now most notorious fictional character -- but just four weeks (!) away at this point, EA dropped Friday the final big ""The Journey"" tease, with plenty to digest from the story mode to come.
Hunter, of course, made his debut in ""FIFA 17"" in a mode that though perhaps not as deep as many would have liked, certainly provided a single-player level of both fun and authenticity previously not showcased from basic Player Career Modes. A year later, with us all ready to see what Hunter and the now universally hated Gareth Walker have instore next, EA gave us a peak behind the curtain, which looks to match the previous trailer's promise to take us merely beyond the Premier League limitations of the inaugural go at a story mode:
There's still one deal left to announce.@MrAlexHunter goes global! https://t.co/ViQCLA15R5 #FIFA18 pic.twitter.com/R8J5iVxLSv— EA SPORTS FIFA (@EASPORTSFIFA) September 1, 2017

The trailer confirms the presence of Antoine Griezmann, US international Gyasi Zardes, Thomas Müller, Thierry Henry, the Houston Rockets' (and ""NBA Live 18"" cover star) James Harden, Dele Alli, and of course the FIFA cover man himself, Cristiano Ronaldo, in-game, showcasing different in-game footage as well of Hunter in Atletico Madrid, LA Galaxy, Bayern Munich, and Real Madrid shirts to boot.
Curiously, one cut scene showcased a defending Women's World Cup champions USA's player with the number 12 in in-game action, but didn't seem to resemble the USWNT's actual current No. 12, Lynn Williams, nor any of the typical US women stars (Alex Morgan, Carli Lloyd, Megan Rapinoe, etc.) It remains to be seen whether that means a fictional USA starlet crosses paths with Hunter in the States and invites him to a match or what exactly.
Of course, the two stills making all the rounds on social media Friday centered around a possible FUT tie-in as well as some rumors that have been circulating since Gamescom.
The first, pertains to Hunter being shown in front of the now familiar ""Ones to Watch"" word mark:

Could this mean a dynamic Ones to Watch item you get in Ultimate Team that improves as you progress through ""The Journey""? It's a nice thought, but given that Hunter received a TOTS in 17 in-game in the Story Mode but the item you received in FUT for completing ""The Journey"" wasn't one, it's hardly a sure thing. It's more likely this is just cross-branding related to the general idea that Hunter is getting the item for making his move to Spain/Germany/France/etc.
Lastly, the big one. Are those ... Kids playing street football?

Hold your horses. Just because a cut scene showcases street football in what looks to be a Brazilian favela hardly means a ""FIFA Street"" return is imminent. And while some unauthorized leaked footage from Gamescom spurred the rumor mill into overdrive, a source tells Futhead News to temper your expectations; they emphasized you'll understand quickly why some of the leaks that made the rounds aren't necessarily a precursor to anything grander when the game launches.

All in all, still a promising trailer. Whether all we get is just a story-mode cut scene with street football or something more, the nostalgia for a game many of us loved is a nice touch. And the apparent added depth in this year's game versus last year's inaugural offering appears quite nice. The big future next step now is perhaps laying the ground work for a more ""NBA 2K""-esque mode, where you can play as Hunter or customize the character to put yourself more literally in their shoes."

Welcome to the first article in our FIFA 19 Wish List series where today we will be looking at Career Mode. Personally, it’s one of my favourite game modes and even though FUT grabs much of the day to day spotlight, I think everyone still has a soft spot for FIFA’s take on management simulation. 
After a few barren years, Career Mode received somewhat of a shot in the arm in FIFA 18 with new transfer depth and The Journey style cut scenes aiming to bring drama and polish to the buying and selling of the worlds biggest stars. At the end of the day, transfers are why we all play Career Mode, so it was great to see development focus in that area, even if some of the cutscenes novelty wore off over time. 
However, Career Mode is still some way from fulfilling its true potential and this is where we need your help. I’ve come up with three of my own suggestions to get the debate started, but then it’s over to you guys in the comments. Please, use the up/down votes like crazy to bring the best ideas to the surface. 
Scenario Mode
One of Career Mode’s core strengths is the fact that you start each save with a blank canvas. So, whether you’re Man City or Yeovil, you start with zero wins, zero losses and your relative prospects for success are largely the same. If you buy some good players and develop some youngsters, winning is only really limited by your own ability with the game. And whilst that’s great, it can also be a limiting factor to enjoyment, because sometimes in football management, things get difficult. 
And that’s why a form of “Scenario Mode” where you pick-up a teams mid-season crisis would add some much-needed depth to Career Mode. Not only would it mirror 99% of the situations new managers find themselves in (very few take over happy and successful sides) but it would also give us as players that challenge and reason to play over and above creating dream teams. 
And you don’t need to look too far around Europe’s top leagues right now to find inspiration for this idea either. In England Southampton are currently in the relegation zone, in Spain Real Madrid are fourth, and in Germany just a few weeks ago Cologne had no wins in sixteen. Any of these scenarios would be great to get involved with during either the mid or late season. 

Technically this one would be a huge challenge because everything (not just results) would need to be simmed up to the point at which we would take over, and whether that’s automated or hand crafted, it would need serious time investment regardless. But the value scenarios like this offer in terms of player experiences, could be geneuinely revolutionary for Career Mode. EA have dabbled with Scenario Mode in the Euro and World Cup games in the past and now it’s time it came back in full force for FIFA 19.

Press Conferences
Now to the bane of Career Mode’s existence: Press Conferences. They have been the same bland, boring, benign mess in Career Mode for as long as I can remember, and if I have to select “Praise” or “Unnerve” one more time, I’m going to launch my PS4 Pro out of the window. Okay, maybe not, but the point still stands. 
The one glimmer of hope for Press Conferences in FIFA 19 is of course that EA will use their recent foray in to The Journey style cutscenes for transfers deals as inspiration to give Career Mode Press Conferences something more befitting than arbitrary responses. So many stories in the football world come from pre and post match press confrences, it's criminal that they've remained untouched in Career Mode for so long. Especially as EA have worked so tirelessly to craft bigger and better news hubs which are ideal to carry this kind of information.
One thing Career Mode fails to capture is the personality of managers and Press Conferences could be a very real way to bring that part of football management to life. Rivalry and mind games are all part and parcel of being a football manager these days and it's time Career Mode represented that better. 
Licensing
This is less a suggestion and more a hope for continued support from EA on their already impressive licensing footprint. Not only in terms of onboarding new competitions all together, but also the branding packages for existing leagues too. There is no doubt that the broadcast packages EA have applied to the Premier League, Bundesliga and La Liga have made Career Mode a better mode. In terms of immersion alone, they just do. 
And having that truly authentic layer applied over the top of Career Modes systems and transfers is what pulls it all together. If you’re going to play a mode for five to ten seasons, you need to be able to invest in the environment and having real stadiums, branding, managers and audio acts as the final piece of a very difficult puzzle. So quite simply EA just need to keep doing, what they’re already doing by bringing the likes of Serie A, Ligue 1 and many others up to the same level over the next few years.

Now it's over to you so get your ideas, thoughts and suggestions on Career Mode only for FIFA 19 in the comments!"

The Team of the Week predictions certainly looked tasty. And while this one doesn't quite live up to the billing -- at least not in my mind -- FUT 18's TOTW 16 is a near miss if nothing else. Better to shoot for the moon, etc, right?
Folks have been clamoring for Brazillian keeper Ederson to get a bump to his Ones to Watch -- and boy is it ever here. An 85-overall with some very nice face item stats has him squarely in the mix for the best non-De Gea/Courtois/Lloris keepers for your Premier League squads/hybrids. A second in-form for Paul Pogba is a beautiful dream for most, but some lucky Futheader/FIFA community member is surely gonna be dabbing their way into 2018. The pair of Manchester stars are also joined by the likes of Dejan Lovren, Dele Alli, Jesse Lingard, and another in-form for Alexis Sanchez this week. And look at that cheeky IF Willian making the case to be your next right winger.
If we had to pick one sleeper though -- and there's a couple on the bench and reserves that might appeal to the bargain hunters out there as well -- Bournemouth's Nathan Ake gets an upgrade that'll surely have many considering slotting him into their sides when they might not have been so inclined before. Look at that Pace/Defense/Physical combo. Goodness.

Marquee Matchups rang in the New Year, but it seems EA have kept the curveballs coming. Hopefully with the return of the Ligue 1 and Bundesliga to the fixture pool we can a bit of normalcy restored.
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
MK Dons vs Wimbledon
Match Info: A derby unlike any others, this matchup between the two sides in England’s League 1 defineitley merits consideration. Stock up on the silvers and check out the history of these clubs after you finish this article! 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 69 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Al Hilal vs Al Ittihad
Match Info:  Described as Saudi Arabia's El Clasico, the matchup between these side could finally warrant EA including the league in the Marquee Matchups. The non-rares should be good shouts here -- especially if you can snag some golds.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 rated


Player Requirement: 2 to 3 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Bayer Leverkusen vs Bayern Munich
Match Info: The Bundesliga makes its return, and it's hard for us to see EA ignoring this one. Two of the more historic clubs square off in the return week so be on the lookout here. Preaching the non-rares for this one still!   

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Liverpool vs Man City
Match Info: Another week, another big game in the PL. Can Liverpool overcome an injury plagued Man City? It would be good for all the teams in the race and with such significance is definitely a match to watch.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there tends to be some variance each week, let's take a look at some more outside the box picks that could make their way in:
Shrewsbury vs Blackburn
Match Info: We return to England’s League 1 where the number two and three ranked sides faceoff in a crucial promotion tie. Any investment here can be used to hedge the Wimbledon vs MK fixture, which is great for investors. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 68 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


RB Leipzig vs Schalke
Match Info: Circling back to Germany, another game on the weekend features these two sides who are fighting for UCL spots in the league. EA love throwing curveballs so is this one to bite on? Either way, non-rares are a solid low risk investment here.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


FC Nantes vs PSG
Match Info: Just like the Bundesliga, Ligue 1 returns to action next week. Although there are no blatant derbies/obvious choices, a matchup between these two sides is the most compelling. Be weary of a random French league inclusion, but regardless these players should hold value. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sheffield wednesday vs Sheffield united
Match Info: Yep, a lot of English derbies it seems this week, but this Championship tie rounds off the Sleeper list. The Steel City derby presents a compelling investment option as EA love including diverse leagues. Plenty of non-rare options to go around.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 70 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
Taking broad stabs here yet again, but last week's sort of paid off.
Any La Liga Santander match
Investing Strategies
It's that time. Remember to take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team on how to possible make a few coins with would-be Marquee Matchups:

-- Prioritize investing in players who are members of the two teams featuring in a specific Marquee Matchup (higher rated the better)
-- Non-Rare cards usually have a higher return on investment
-- Certain positions such as LB/RB, CMs and STs are generally more profitable"

Marquee Matchups could be one of the first big SBCs of the New Year, so let's kick things off right! With a lot of big leagues on winter breaks, and quite a few cup matches to boot, this upcoming week presents us with a bit of an enigma. Yet, we’ve scoured the books, and used some research to make educated guesses. Let's check 'em out:
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Sevilla vs Betis
Match Info: One of the fiercest rivalries in Spain, El Derbi Sevillano will be a welcomed fixture to start 2018! With the first matchup taking place in 1915, EA would be sorely mistaken to leave this one out. A plethura of non-rares make investing here tasty.

Match Info:  Another big match in the Iberian peninsula, the two teams from the capital face of in Derby de Lisboa. Again, a very historic rivalry that would be a shame if EA ignored it. Both teams feature a lot of non-rares, which are your best bets.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 rated


Player Requirement: 2 to 3 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Arsenal vs Chelsea
Match Info: Over the past couple of weeks, the Premier League matches featuring in Marquee Matchups have seemed uber random. Yet  hopefully this prominent London derby will change that trend. Plenty of non-rare or low value rare golds for this matchup.   

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Sydney vs Newcastle
Match Info: Although this fixture is not a derby, it still features the top two teams in the A-League. There have been a lot of predictions about Australia; however, with EA scrounging for matchups, this provides a compelling case. Best to look for the non-rare silvers here.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 70 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there tends to be some variance each week, let's take a look at some more outside the box picks that could make their way in:
Tottenham vs West Ham
Match Info: Yep, another London rivalry takes place this Marquee Matchup cycle, so this could be a great match to hedge your PL positions. Regardless, they’ll be useful for any match included from England's top flight.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Liverpool vs Everton (Cup)
Match Info: A Merseyside derby is always difficult to omit, so it makes our sleeper list. A great rivalry but the demotion to a sleeper pick centers around the fact that it is a cup tie. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Juventus vs Torino (Cup)
Match Info: Again, a cup game lowered this one to a sleeper pick, but a Turin derby should never go unnoticed. At least tune in to the fixture, but Calcio A non-rares always hold their value 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
Our New Year resolutiom is to get one of these right...
Any Serie (Calcio) A match...
Investing Strategies
It's that time. Remember to take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team on how to possible make a few coins with would-be Marquee Matchups:

-- Prioritize investing in players who are members of the two teams featuring in a specific Marquee Matchup (higher rated the better)
-- Non-Rare cards usually have a higher return on investment
-- Certain positions such as LB/RB, CMs and STs are generally more profitable*"

Market Overview
As 2017 comes to an end, it seems fitting this past week pretty much embodies how the FUT market has moved all year. Over the past couple of weeks, people have been selling off investments, and that was even more apparent with the release of new Prime Icons yesterday. 
After this, people take their new treasure hoards and splurge on Icons and special items. This stabilized prices and has led to a slight rise. That being said, always be weary of the Team of the Year promos on the horizon.  

In terms of the Ones to Watch market, it usually follows market conditions; however, this week was a little unique as the low end player held their value as the highest rated items took some hits. The former is largely in part to the Player of the Month requirements, while the latter should be explained by investors having weaker confidence in those players.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  Some large low/high ranges for most players this week should trigger one to ask: are these players hitting peaks or trough? For players like Romelu Lukaku, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Bruma that could be especially true. 
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take: Volatility can be a trader’s best friend, but you have to time it right. So if you’re more of a risk taker a player like Federico Bernardeschi  would be a good look, while the more risk-averse could find comfort in someone like Keita Balde Diao. 

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: No not the fish, man hope that joke killed it… It seems the highest betas came from the low end items like Franck Yannick Kessie, Bertrand Traore and Theo Hernandez. This reflects their increased inflated price due to POTM, but be cautious when this promo ends.
TOTW Shout
On the 20th Kylian Mbappe put in a goal and an assist, while Mohamed Salah has been racking up the assists and a goal over his past two games. Both players were on the outside looking in as other big stars shined brighter.
In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner --  Leonardo Bonucci (AC Milan)  
It was a surprise to see Leonardo Bonucci have a surprising good week considering the train wreck that is AC Milan’s December. Yet, after some reflection we realized that his big price jump could very well be attributed to TOTY hype. 
Bonucci was selected to the Best XI squad in early October and if EA follow this as they have historically, the ex-Juventus defender will be primed for a montorous new item -- but his OTW will NOT be upgraded! It is important for people to remember this since that upgrade would be wildly OP and the hype could lead to people losing big. So stay Wyse! 
Big Loser -- James Rodriguez (Bayern)
Now, the big winner was lass number based; however, we’ll get into some stats for the Biggest loser, James Rodriguez. Over the past couple of weeks, the ex-Madrid man has seen his price tumble; therefore, its time to spotlight this fall.
Looking at the numbers, like many losers before him James had a high volatility figure (~22,500) and a high negative beta (-0.86). The preceding statistics both serve as measures of risk, and this week that is exactly what Rodriguez was , a risky item. The large fluctuations are also explained by those figures above; however, most of the price swings have been negative so always research accordingly.
As always, a silver lining comes from the fact that he is becoming more affordable. The million coin question is when to buy considering another inform for this man would see some major hype and price jump.
Recap & outlook
To wrap it up, this past week has been a microcosm for FUT market throughout 2017. Lots of hype and investing have established some clear windows where the market falls when people are hoarding, and rises as sell of frees up coins. In terms of OTW it's important to be looking to a prospective SBC in early February. So, some interesting final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Still preaching about those open bids. Plenty of great deals and list overnight!  

-- OTW investors: Whispers of a possible OTW SBC in February are beginning, prices are still a little high, but be vigilant.

FIFA 18 is set to be released in less than a month -- Friday, Sept. 29. But, if you're that eager to get started, there are multiple ways to play the game even sooner.
For most, the closed beta version was the first opportunity to play the game. However, participants had to agree to a non-disclosure agreement and the beta simply isn't available to the mass audiences. Like every year though, a couple weeks before launch, EA will release a FIFA 18 demo, a limited version of the game featuring an estimated ten or so clubs and potentially a trial run of FIFA's 'The Journey: Season Two.' 
On top of the demo, FIFA players on Xbox One can subscribe and pay for ""EA Access"", which will give you the opportunity to download and play the full game before others. However, there is a 10 hour total gameplay time limit to the trial. For Windows/PC players, a similar offer called ""Origin Access"", will give you 10 hours of early access before the game hits stores. Both are expected available as early as September 20, 2017.
Finally, particularly of interest to PS4 players, preordering the Icon or Ronaldo edition of FIFA 18 will give you three days of early access, so you'll be able to start playing the full game on Sept. 26. Additionally, buying the Icon/Ronaldo edition will grant you loads of other content, like up to 40 FUT Jumbo Premium Gold Packs, Team of the Week loan items, and special Cristiano Ronaldo and Ronaldo Nazário loan packs."

The greatest and most frustrating time of the year wrapped in one blanket is approaching. The launch of the FIFA Ultimate Team Web App is the official start of new FIFA season. It's also a time when the community loses its collective mind as the inevitable flood of traffic into one site causes connectivity hell. Once you're lucky enough to finagle your way into the web app, that's when the fun begins.
In this series, we will be going over some basic common sense trading tips that will guarantee you make a modest amount of coins. There are no get rich schemes here. In fact, those are a myth in this FIFA market, especially this early in the game. Let's get started. 
SELL, SELL, SELL
The first thing you want to do when you open the web app is what everyone wants to do. Open all those sweet, sweet loyalty packs. Surely you will pull that Icon Ronaldo right off the bat and be set for the rest of FIFA 18 and this guide will be rendered useless. On the off-chance that doesn't happen, the next thing you want to do after welcoming all those nice gentlemen into your fresh club, is send them packing. That's right. SELL. EVERYTHING. 
This is where philosophies differ. A lot of traders will insist you keep hold of your shiny Premier League players as their price will rise. This is a fact, but it's going to take weeks for that to happen. That's time you're wasting with coins sitting in your club that can you can use to flip cards. My rule is this: Sell everything unless it's an elite player. I'm talking a player who'll go for 40,000+ coins. 
What's important to remember about the beginning of FUT is that the market will be super inflated. This is in stark contrast to the end of a FIFA cycle when everything is dirt cheap. We're talking about Harry Kane's going for 80k and ridiculous trends like that. Cards that will be 10k in two months will be extremely valuable. Keep this in mind when evaluating what counts as an elite player. 
Sell all your bronze and silver cards for whatever you can get. Be careful of overlooking popular cards. Set all your BINs to max if you're unsure and don't want to risk it. If a card is popular, it will sell for fair value as the market will be flooded with people trying to find deals. Sell your gold cards for reasonable value. Don't be greedy here. Spend a day or two trying to get your desired price. If that doesn't work, sell them and get rid. 
BUY TO YOUR STRENGTHS
This is where our trading guide will differe from others. Most will tell you to focus on a certain league and a certain rarity. A lot of people like to go for silver Premier League or Championship players, for example. Our advice is use your knowledge of real life football as a guide. Pick a league you know a lot about and think like someone who is building a squad. Your focus should be on popular common players who buyers will want to build their first team with. 
MLS is a good league to use as an example. Everyone knows there are some cheap beasts in the league that make for great starter squads. When buying up your first round of players, put your coins into players who pass the eye test. Great stats = great profit. If a player has insane pace and good shooting stats for a striker, buy him. Good pace and good passing for a CAM, buy him. Good pace (noticing a trend here?) and good defending for a CM, buy him. 
Another thing to look out for are hyped up players that will go under the radar to the mainstream community. A personal example: FIFA 15 and DeAndre Yedlin. Yedlin has moved to Tottenham Hotspur after a great World Cup. He's one of the fastest players in the game. At the time the web app released, he was going for 3-5K. I bought two of him and listed for insane prices. One sold for 25K overnight and the other sold for massive profit too. This is an exception to the norm, but it's possible to find these types of deals if you know what you're looking for. 
The goal for every card you buy is to make decent profit. Ideally, you want to make at least 500 coins (after the 5% EA tax) on every transaction. Every card you buy will not sell right away. The idea is to be persistent. List your cards every hour then keep re-listing until someone bites. 
EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS
Another important thing to remember is to take advantage of everything EA gives you. Remember to login every day to collect your free rewards. Whether it's a gift pack or 5,000 coins, every little bit helps when your trading from scratch. We're not trying to trade to Ronaldo right now. We're building our bankroll one step at a time leading up to the full worldwide release of the game when the market will begin to rise to full health. 
Follow these common sense tips and you'll be in a fine position coin-wise when the full game releases. Be persistent in your trading and don't be afraid to take some risks. Good luck out there."

Many of us expected a super OP FUT 18 TOTW -- particularly with rumors swirling about a possible additional Guaranteed Team of the Week Squad Buildling Challenge. And while what we got was relatively top heavy, perhaps so not in a way we expected though?
No record breakers, despite Harry Kane surpassing Alan Shearer for the best individual goal-scoring output in a single Premier League calendar year nor none for Lionel Messi, who became the all-time leading scorer at any top-league European club. But both gentleman have nice in-forms for their weekends, which is better than nothing I suppose. Manchester City, the class of England, are represented by super-striker Sergio Aguero to boot.
There's a few interesting items littered throughout the rest of the squad -- and heck, many will likely be quite useful in future SBCs -- but there's not exactly anyone worth breaking the bank for. Maybe that's actually better evidence of a tradeable SBC's inevitability given that they might not have wanted to flood the market (and club) with more potent items? We'll have to wait and see.
The full FIFA 18 Team of the Week 15 is as follows:"

Marketing materials from both Game in the UK and the French equivalent both advertised ""Prime Icons"" in the lead up to one of the more festive times of the FIFA 18 calendar.
After some waiting, some premature optimism, and a few dozen FUTmas player SBCs, the big ones are finally here.
FIFA 18's latest throwback Thursday include a pair of Arsenal Icons, Dennis Bergkamp and the soon-to-be-in-every-pros' clubs, Patrick Vieira. Their Prime Icon SBCs are available today, along with those of Carles Puyol and the recently-record-surpassed Alan Shearer of England and Newcastle fame.
A reminder that these Prime Icons are available in packs tradeably (and subsequently on the Transfer Market) until the end of FIFA or as untradeable prizes for completing Squad Buildling Challenges. There's also Loan versions of each available for the next week only.The SBCs will not be cheap but they also don't have to be built in a day. You can accrue the pieces necessary for the untrdeables between now and the end of the game's natural life if you so desire, and probably find them a lot more palatable price-wise in the process.
For the rest of us loading up on FIFA points and dumping items to the transfer market to build up the wealth necessary to go after them, which Prime Icon are you the most excited about chasing?"

Market Overview
Belated Merry Christmas and a late happy Boxing Day! The holiday season is in full swing, and the FUT market was surprisingly tame. Of course there were plenty of Christmas noobs, so hopefully you snagged some nice open bids; however, EA finally dropped the Team of the Week SBCs we’ve been waiting for. So people will be selling of their investments and with these new coins buying up high end players. 
Shifting focus to the Path to Glory market, players prices ebbed and flowed normally following the overall FUT market. Some players saw marked declines, and those would be the ones playing in leagues taking long winter breaks, but others rose slightly as their solid game time gives investors confidences. Now, let's get into the specifics.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take: Early in the week most cards saw their highs; however, before Christmas people began to liquidate. This sell off led to decreased prices due to undercutting, yet as Boxing Day dawns they seem to be stabilizing.
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take:  Across the board a very tame week for volatility, but that can be a good thing too. It means you will know when you picked up a good deal on open bids and players like Sandro Wagner and Marcus Rashford could’ve been cash cows. 
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of a card to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Unlike volatility, players’ betas varied a lot amongst PTG players. The likes of Kingsley Coman, Rodrigo and Divock Origi could be in line for big price shifts, while Joe Hart and Leroy Sane should continue to follow the overall market trend.
TOTW Shout 
Dmitri Payet scored a goal and played well in Marseille last game before their winter break. That said it was a long shot at best, but, then again...
Big Winner- Stephan El Shaarawy (Roma)
The silver stunner from FIFA 12, Stephan El Shaarawy, sees himself receive the Biggest Winner accolade this holiday season. A series of positive personal performances coupled with an inform already means the Roma winger has value. 
Referring to his weekly statistics, has had large price range over the week (High & Low), a mild volatility (~3500) and a high negative beta (-0.74). A mild volatility fits the other items in the PTG market, but his negative beta demonstrates that one should expect some sizable price shifts in the opposite of the market. We’ll have to keep an eye on the beta as the market looks to be stabilizing and dare I say turning. 
Taking a step back, another upgrade makes the five star skiller a very attractive option; however, the price at the moment might be a little overvalued.
Big Loser- Lars Stindl (Borussia Mönchengladbach)
This mans Team of the Season last year was a GOD; however, as a Fiorentina fan, I am nothing if not subtly glad Lars Stindl finds himself as a Biggest Loser. The utility man from Gladbach is not a loser because of his personal performance, but rather an example of people weary of the long Bundesliga break. 
Besides a large Weekly loss, Stindl also sported a high volatility relative to his price and a negative beta similar to El Shaarawy. Evident by his volatility, this item has seen a lot of fluctuation over the week so if you timed it right take your profit. Yet, looking forward his price should stabilize which might be a good investment look. 
Look at Stindl’s history, he seems to put in quality performances in the second half of the season so watch this space. 
Weekend Watch
The best part of the holiday season is all the football! So enjoy yourself and watch to your heart's desire. We will pick this back up next week.

Recap
To wrap it up, it was a tame but rather interesting holiday week. The FUT market took a dip right before Christmas but now it’s starting to stabilize and rise. The PTG market is right there with it, but the upgrade potential should be monitored by all investors.   

Leave any input below, and look out for a Ones To Watch update soon!

                        It's that time of the year again and after the initial MC squad I expect the usual routine to follow with the PL coming next.
                    

Formation: 4-4-2. 
Squad link:  http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/6000446/
Please keep in mind this side was created after game-week 34 for some of the stats may be slightly off when you are reading this.

Goalkeeper
De Gea - GK - OVR 90
This could go to one of many keepers but with De Gea being named PFA keeper of the year and is regarded by many as the best keeper in the world along with Neuer after another impressive season for the Spaniard I just can't see him being ignored. United are still in a stage of change as shown with another disappointing finish but once again De Gea has shone for the red devils.
Defenders
Marcos Alonso - LWB - OVR 79
Alonso always impressed while playing his football in Italy for Fiorentina and with Chelsea implementing a similar 3-5-2 tactic throughout the season it really has allowed the Spaniard to flourish. Not only does Alonso have Chelsea's impressive defensive record to boast about but also has five goals and two assists. With Chelsea looking like clear favourites for title it won't come as a surprise that Alonso is one of many selected from the Blues.
David Luiz - CB - OVR 84
All three of Chelsea's CB's have a shout for a spot in this side but for me the Brazilian edges them. Luiz often gets stick, which can be related to his price tag but he defiantly plays a part for the side and is one of the best defenders in the world. He has just the one goal to his name but he is in for his and Chelsea’s defensive performances.
Cesar Azpilicueta- CB - OVR 84
Although I doubt all three will make it I am going to include two of them. Cahill is perhaps harshly being left out after he picked up a spot in PFA's TOTS however my personal opinion is that Azpilicueta has been the most consistent of the three. The Spaniard has played an unusual role in the middle but has excelled throughout. 
Kyle Walker -RB - OVR 82
Walker's pace has always resulted in him being a decent defender but he has really stepped into his own during the 2016/17 campaign. Tottenham are keeping up the chase at the top and although a large part of that comes down to their attacking presence the defensive side of things can't be overlooked. Spurs have an impressive 1 clean sheets and although Walker didn't start in two of those matches he has still played a large part of that. The English RB has failed to score but does have a respectable six assists to his name.
Midfielders
Eden Hazard - LW - OVR 89
After the criticism, Hazard received last season it's safe to say that the Belgian is back to what is expected of him. He has arguably been Chelsea's most influential player with 14 goals and 5 assists to his name and although he has been patchy in places form wise he never fails to deliver when he is needed. The fact he has five special items already this FIFA shows just how important he has been for them.
Dele Alli - CAM - OVR 82
Alli goes from strength to strength and after last year you would have thought that was impossible, apparently not though with the Spurs midfielder managing an impressive 16 goals and 7 assists in an extremely strong title challenge from Tottenham. Alli is slowly developing into one of the best players in the English league and will no doubt be for the foreseeable future
N'Golo Kante - CM - OVR 83
The man that’s everywhere! After picking up PFA's player of the year the obvious choice of Kante was all but confirmed to be in TOTS as well. He is arguably the best in the world at what he does and with the reputation the Frenchman now possesses I fully expect the BPL to pick up a TOTY item during next year thanks to him. He may not add much offensively but defensively he is as good as it gets. Welcome to the new elite squad of 90+ The Kante gang
Sadio Mane - RW - OVR 82
You only have to look at Liverpool’s record both with and without Mane to realise just how important he is to them. There form dropped significantly when Mane went off to AFCON and had he remained with them who knows where the momentum could have taken them. He boasts 13 goals and 6 assists to his name which for a winger which has played 27 games is quite impressive indeed.
Forwards
Romelu Lukaku - ST - OVR 84
With the likes of Aguero and Ibra running the division Lukaku goes under the radar when it comes to the best strikers in the division. The Belgian has made a real case though and had he been playing for a main side could well have been referred to as the very best. You can't ignore 24 goals and 6 assists in 33 games after all.
Harry Kane - ST - OVR 85
Once dubbed as being a one season wonder Harry Kane has now had his third consecutive wonder season and looks like he is here to stay. The Spurs striker bagged himself 20 goals and 5 assists in the 24 games he played and at just 23 years of age it won't be long before you see him join the elite strikers in BPL history.
Substitutes
Tom Heaton - GK - OVR 78
Although the starting keeper in this side can quite easily be debated when it comes to who has impressed in goal Heaton is the first name that comes to mind. Burnley struggle away from home but have one of the best home records in the division. A big part of that is Heaton who has racked up an impressive 123 saves with 9 clean sheets in the process. Heaton will be in this side without a doubt.
Seamus Coleman - RB - OVR 82
Coleman's season unfortunately came to an end courtesy of an injury however I feel that he had enough of an impact in the games he played to still make the cut for this side. Coleman managed to play 26 of the possible 38 matches which is pushing it but with four goals, four assists and a decent enough defensive record in that time I can see the Irishman making the cut for the first time since FIFA 14
Jan Vertonghen - CB - OVR 83
Either one of Tottenham’s CB's could get this spot and personally I would have edged towards Toby getting the nod but after Vertonghen was given the nod in MC it could well make him the favourite. There has been a tendency to use the MC items in the retrospective league TOTS's over the past few years and I expect it to follow suit.
Kevin De Bruyne - CM - OVR 88
Had De Bruyne been fully fit throughout the season I'm sure there would be little question about his inclusion in the side but seeing as his fitness has been hit and miss he becomes a fringe player in truth. The fact that the Belgian leads the assist rankings will work in his favour though and 3 is not something to overlook. Just the four goals to his name however.
Christian Eriksen - CAM - OVR 85
Another Spurs player now and rightfully so with them being the surprise package of the year. Since joining the club from Ajax Eriksen has developed into one of Spur's best players and his importance to the side is often over shadowed by their other big hitters. With 8 goals and 12 assists to his name this season including some vital goals it would be a shock to see him excluded from this team.
Alexis Sanchez - ST - 88 OVR 
Although Sanchez's games have been very varied between playing up top or on the wing the fact he has played more as a ST would suggest that he will be receiving his TOTS item in that position. The Chilean has once again excelled being Arsenal's star man, scoring 19 goals and setting up another 10. That’s 29-goal contribution in just 31 games, that’s quite impressive.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic - ST - OVR 90
Many thought that Ibra was going to flop when he made the move to United but with Zlatan being Zlatan he had other ideas. The Swede managed to score 17 goals and grabbed 5 assists to go with it. Although this doesn't compete with his Ligue 1 statistics nor with the best in the division it is still safe to say that Zlatan has done well for United.
Reserves
Gareth Mcauley - CB - OVR 76
What Pulis has managed with WBA is quite simply astounding. Known for his ability to help teams survive is one thing but to lead WBA to 8th position is something which really shouldn't be overlooked. Mcauley is their second highest goal scorer with six goals and thus makes him their best option. WBA deserve a spot and Mcauley is by far the best option there.
Joshua King - CAM - OVR 72
King's second half of the season has been significantly more impressive than his first but in terms of TOTS it is beneficial to be that way around. With that being said a midfielder with 14 goals to their name always becomes difficult to ignore and his late surge in form makes him a strong contender for the side.
Gylfi Sigurdsson - CAM - OVR 82
Sigurdsson has occupied numerous positions over the course of the season thus making his actual position hard to judge. It will be between that of CAM and LW but regardless of what position he ends up at his importance to Swansea cannot be questioned. If it was not for Sigurdsson they would already be down. Due to Hylfi though they stand a chance of surviving going into the final games of the season. Talking statistics now the Icelandic midfielder has eight goals and twelve assists to his name.
Diego Costa - ST - OVR 85
You either love him or you hate him but what we can all agree on is that Costa will always cause problems. He has been rather patchy this season but despite that has still scored 19 goals for Chelsea in their title winning run. The Spaniard has also picked up 6 assists but is in my opinion the weakest striker option from those selected in this side and if 6 is a bit much he could well miss out.
Sergio Aguero - ST - OVR 89
Aguero has once again struggled with injuries which has limited his game time and in turn his chance for the golden boot. He has however featured in 26 games for City of which he has scored 17 times in. This will be more than enough to put him into a 23 man TOTS and although he hasn't been at the top of his game Aguero will always score goals.
Extra (SBC)
Jermain Defoe - ST - OVR 81
This is pure speculation but much like the tournaments held last year for an extra item I expect the same to happen this time but with SBC's instead. The gold MC was allocated an extra item than the others and my guess is that’s for an SBC.
Sunderland may have been relegated but it would have been so much worse had it not have been for Defoe. He single handedly carried them for most the season and although his efforts were not enough he was always fighting a losing battle. He dropped off towards the end of the season but to score 14 goals for a side in last position is brilliant."

You may have already seen some pack art screengrabs making the round, but none the less, another big FIFA Mobile program is here.
Showcasing some of the best English internationals of the not-too-distant past, an ""English Heroes"" program is here.
While the downside is there's no live events, all the players in this one are tradeable -- and the high end 99-overall Wayne Rooney is an absolute beast. Think his ""Record Breakers"" item on steroids.
Much like ""Record Breakers"", these cards are only obtainable through limited availability packs (though you'll certainly begin to see them on the transfer market after that).
Here's the players involved:
-- LB 94 OVR Ashley Cole (+3 DRI to ENG, +2 SPA to ALL)
-- ST 96 OVR Jermaine Defoe (+3 FIN to ENG, +2 SPA to ALL)
-- CB 96 OVR John Terry (+3 MRK to ENG, +2 SPA to ALL)
-- CF 99 OVR Wayne Rooney (+3 BAC to ALL, +3 SPA to ALL)"

                        Welcome to my weekly Ones to Watch update and analysis! I’ve combed through the schedules of all the players with OTW items and organized their game times and likelihood of starting into a handy spreadsheet.  
                    

OTW Weekend is brought to you by @GummiFifa!
It is fair to say that Ones to Watch items have been a major hit in FIFA 17. In particular, the trading and investing community has taken to these cards because of the relative ease at which you can earn coins by trading with them. We have seen many investors earn millions off of well-timed OTW trades!
As you’ve noticed the market has dropped tremendously this month and OTW players are no exception in that case. The season is nearly over in every league in Europe and people are not willing to take the risk and buy the players before the game. This means you have to keep an eye on the games and lineups and be ready if an OTW player scores. 
I’ve prepared the OTW list for the weekend of 5-8th May to help you trade this weekend. Keep in mind, although some players are likely to start, I can obviously not guarantee that they will start. 
Predictions are taken from Whoscored.com.
Players that have been in form lately:
M'Baye Niang: Always in the starting lineup and has been efficient to score and assist lately. 
Gonzalo Higuain: Higuain just can’t stop scoring. Always In the starting lineup and nearly scores every game. 
Gerard Deulofeu: Always in the starting lineup. Has been tremendous after he came to AC Milan. Keep an eye on him
Leroy Sané: Always in the starting lineup and he is very efficient to score and assist his teammates.
Manolo Gabbiadini: Starting to play regularly and could bang in some goals before the end of the season!
Gabriel Jesus (Manchester City): Has been very effective the last two games. This guy scores whenever he gets a chance to play!
Alvaro Morata (Real Madrid): When he plays, he scores or makes a big impact on the game. He is predicted to start this weekend.
Injury updates
Paul Pogba (Manchester United): He is back in the squad but is doubtful to start on saturday
Paul Ntep (Wolfsburg): Has missed 10 games due to an injury. Very bad injury as he has torn muscle bundle. Expected to return around 10. May 2017. 
Mamadou Sakho (Crystal Palace): Picked up a bad injury in the game vs Tottenham on Wednesday. As of now we have no news of the injury. This is a very serious injury and he could be out for the season. 
Gabriel Jesus (Manchester City): HE IS BACK! 
Sadio Mané (Liverpool): Out for the season
Luiz Adriano (Spartak Moscow): He is still undergoing treatment for his injury and is a doubt for the game this weekend. He is a doubt this weekend. 
Breel Embolo (Schalke): Has been injured since October. He is expected to be fit before the end of the season. 
Eric Bailly (Manchester United): Went off injured in the last game. He is also a doubt along with Pogba for the game vs Arsenal on Sunday. 

How to Trade with OTW Players
So, now that I’ve peaked your curiosity, I’m sure you are wondering how exactly to trade with OTW cards. There are two main methods that have proven to work every single week.
This first method is to take advantage of bad performances. When a player performs badly (a main indicator is the team losing or the player earning a poor whoscored match rating) his price tends to drop after the game, presumably because many investors and casual players panic sell the card. This provides an opportune window to pick the card up for cheap. Then, throughout the week, his price will slowly rise until game day. While it may be tempting to hold the player until he earns an inform, remembering the pattern from last week, we will want to sell the player on before the next game actually starts (a good time to sell is usually when he is announced in the starting lineup). The reason why we do that is because if he doesn’t perform well in the first 30-45 minutes his price will start to drop as it did the week prior. This is called selling in the hype.
The second method is more profitable but requires more attention. What you have to do is either watch the game that the OTW is playing or you have notifications turned on, on your phone or computer, that notify you straight away when there is a goal. If a OTW player scores in the game his price will skyrocket. However, picking up the player is not easy and you have to be quick. The time frame to pick up a player when he scores is constantly becoming smaller. At this stage in the game, you have around 20 seconds to pick up the player before your room for profit is gone. After these 20 seconds, his price will have already inflated and he won’t be worth picking up.
Trading with OTW players has never been as popular as it is now. This is not only going to make you profit, but it is also entertaining! The key is selling into the hype and not getting caught holding a card too long because of greed. Slow, steady profits will win the race in the long run.
Best of luck!

                        Dzeko, Mertens, KDB and a OTW Morata headline in week 34
                    

Last week's score: 14/23
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad link:http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/6235907/**

Goalkeeper
Fraser Forster - GK - OVR 78
Several BPL keepers stood out this week but Forster was still the pick of a strong bunch. The Southampton keeper made a total of eight saves alongside saving a Milner penalty as the saints held Liverpool to a 0-0 draw.
Defenders
Alex Oxlaide Chamberlain - RWB - OVR 79
Once again Chamberlain's special item is ruined by the fact he will be classified as a RWB but the Englishman who has played in several roles for Arsenal this year impressed once again for Wenger's side as they managed a 2-0 win over United which ended their 22-game unbeaten streak. The Ox picked up the assist on both the goals which makes him a very strong candidate for this side.
Ezequiel Garay - CB - OVR 84
When a gold CB finds himself on the score sheet twice nine times out of ten he will be in. Garay managed just that as he helped Valencia to a 4-1 win over Osasuna making him one of the easiest selections this week
Patrice Evra - LB - OVR 82
For the first week in a while the defensive options were rather slim and due to that Evra has an increased chance of making the cut. The Frenchman scored one of Marseille's two goals as they narrowly recorded three points via a 2-1 win.
Midfielders
Thomas Lemar- LM - OVR 80
Monaco took another step towards lifting the Ligue 1 title with a 3-0 win away at Nancy and once again it was their youngster in Lemar who stood out. The winger grabbed both a goal and assist which saw him pick up an 8/10 from L'equipe.
Kevin De Bruyne - CM - OVR 88
KDB looks set to pick up a little boost before his TOTS which is just around the corner after City dominated Crystal Palace with a 5-0 win. The Belgian was involved in three of those goals with one of his own alongside two assists. Both Kompany and Otamendi found themselves on the scoresheet but KDB was the main man on the day.
Marco Verratti - CM - OVR 85
Verratti is starting to gain a real reputation for picking up IF's without doing a whole lot and with him claiming an 8/10 and MOTM this week in a crucial win for PSG he could well be picking up his 5th IF this year. The Italian midfielder may have only scored one goal but in the circumstances, he has a strong claim for a spot.
Yannis Salibur - RM - OVR 76
Either Salibur or Briand could make this side after both Guingamp players picked up a brace and an assist during their 4-0 win. I have opted for Salibur purely down to the positional spread with lots of striker options compared to only a few from midfield.
Forwards
Edin Dzeko - ST - OVR 81
Dzeko made his claim for the Serie A golden boot adding another two to his already impressive numbers in Roma's 4-1 win over AC Milan. The Bosnian also picked up an assist which saw him receive an 8/10 from Gazzetta.
Dries Mertens - ST - OVR 85 
Surprise surprise Mertens pops up yet again. The Belgian is in contention for a spot every other week these days and since making the move to ST for Napoli he can't stop finding the back of the net. He picked up POTW in Italy this week after getting two goals and an assist during Napoli's 3-1 win
Morata - ST - OVR 82
Rodriguez was once again the stand out player for Madrid this weekend however seeing as he is in the current side he is unable to be selected this time around. That leaves a spot for Morata to jump into who like Rodriguez scored twice for Madrid to help them secure three points.
Substitutes
Tom Starke - GK - OVR 74
As is often the case when Munich have the title secured you see a lot of different faces getting the chance for them. As always Stake got the nod in goal and once again he has impressed. The veteran saved a last-minute penalty to keep Munich's 1-0 win in tact claiming the top mark from kicker with a 1.
Andrea Costa - CB - OVR 76
This one goes down as a bit of a punt considering that Costa was not actually MOTM but with both a goal and assist to his name in a 3-1 win for Empoli he does look good on paper.
Jose Izquierdo - LW - OVR 77
I am still unsure as to if these matches count but once again when a midfielder scores a hat trick it becomes nigh on impossible to ignore them. Izquierdo managed just that as Brugge came away with a 3-1 win away to Charleroi
Leonardo Bittencourt - LW - OVR 77
Koln played out a seven-goal thriller with Werder Bremen of which they came out on top as 4-3 winners from. They have two potential players in terms of making the cut but with Bittencourt claiming POTW for his goal and two assists I have selected him over Modeste who scored twice.
Wes Hoolahan - CAM - OVR 77
Norwich ended their season with a 4-0 win. The Irish midfielder was involved in all those goals claiming both two goals and two assists.
Florian Niederlechner - ST - OVR 74
Frieburg picked up a huge three points over Schalke with a 2-0 win in their quest for European football. The German striker picked up both their goals which in turn saw him claim a 1 from Kicker. Under the situation of the match that should see him in.
Andre-Pierre Gignac - ST - OVR 82
We often see Gignac pick up several IF's throughout the year now that he is playing his football over in Mexico. This would be his second of the year after he bagged himself a hat trick in Tigres's 5-1 away win
Reserves
Eugenio Lamanna - GK - OVR 72
It's been a while since we have seen two bronze/silver keepers in one TOTW with the lack of them in general recently. This week more than ever it has a chance of happening though. Lamanna made a total of four saves along with a penalty save as Genoa shocked Inter with a 1-0 win. Lamanna picked up MOTM with a 7.5 from Gazzetta making him keeper of the week.
Joe Bennett - LWB - OVR 69
Another wingback with multiple goal contributions now with Bennett. The Cardiff defender was involved in all three of their goals with one for himself alongside setting up the other two in a 3-0 win.
C.J. Sapong - ST - OVR 71
Onto a few silver hat tricks now, the first of which comes in the MLS after Sapong scored all three of Philadelphia's goals in their impressive 3-0 home win over NYRB's.
Gustav Engvall - ST - OVR 68
Over to Sweden now who have been picking up a fair few IF's as of late and they look to be on route to another after Engvall scored three of his sides four goals in a comfortable 4-0 away win.
Jair - ST - OVR 72
It's been a while since we have seen a K-League in-form and perhaps after harshly missing out on a TOTS MC spot Jair has his reward incoming in the form of an IF. The Brazilian played up top for Jeju as they managed a 4-1 home win of which he scored a hat trick in."

Market Overview
New year, new me am I right? Nah, we’re still kicking it with the same Ultimate Team market analysis so you can amass your FUT fortune! Looking back briefly, the week leading up to the New Year was not too eventful. 
Generally, prices had been experiencing a nosedive the week before, but during this period they began to stabilize and even rise. That being said, the end of the week also brought on Team of the Year rumors which has raised uncertainty causing prices to lean more to the red.   

Bearing down on the Path to Glory market, this past week was a nightmare for most cards, especially Gabriel Jesus (significant injuries always have serious price impacts for dynamic items). The weekly stats reflect large declines in prices; however, as we peeled back the layers for this issue there is definitely a silver lining.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take: Some big ranges between highs and lows this week mean that certain items like William Carvalho, Dimitri Payet, and Alejandro Gomez could all be great trade tools -- if you can get in at the right time. 
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take:  Across the board the fluctuation of players has stayed similar to their respective price; however, some anomalies can be seen in Marco Asensio, Saul and Danny Welbeck. All players that can be seen as higher risk/higher reward items.
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of a card to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: PTG players followed their market this week in terms of price shifts, which unfortunately was down. That being said if the market can rebound players like Stephan El Shaarawy, Marcus Rashford and Weekend League terror TiemoueBakayoko could be in line for big returns. 
TOTW Shout 
Nobody really stood out over this past week, but the imminent return Bundesliga and Ligue 1 football should help change this! 
Big Winner- Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Liverpool) 
Well, in a week where only three items would have generated profit Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was a rather easy choice. That being said, it is interesting that a substitute player has been gaining traction so let's check it out. 
A high volatility (~3000) and a high beta (1.27) have been stables of big winners, and that is usually due to large positive price shifts. However, both of these measures lend to the fact that a player like Ox can get caught up in hype or panic leading to big swings up or down. 
Take note of the previous statement, but another factor of the ex-Arsenal winger’s price rise is that cluster of PL matches in January. The fixture list is packed this month and investors have taken notice since he should see increased playing time. As an English midfield for Liverpool, this man definitely still has value. 
Big Loser- Gabriel Jesus (Manchester City)
As opposed to the winners section, this week featured a ton of negative returns; however, a high profile player like Gabriel Jesus has to be highlighted. The elephant in the room is his serious injury, and that is undoubtedly what caused his huge price decline. But…
For savvy investors this could be an opportunity. A very fixed supply of Jesus items exist on the market, and now that this is the only option for an extremely OP player, more of him will be bought and put in clubs. So, monitor the supply of this card on the market because if you pick one up now he could see a moderate price rise as the supply dwindles. 
Make sure to note he will most likely not raise back to 700k or better, but there is some hope. 
Recap
Although it was a week where most PTG saw large declines, it should be noted that the end of winter breaks for big leagues should stabilize players’ prices. Also, as always in weeks of large decline it leaves items more affordable, and therefore more compelling investment options. 
Not saying to go blow all your coins here; however, with EA’s unpredictable SBC requirements and more football to come the PTG players still have value.    

Share your PTG thoughts below, and look out for a Ones To Watch update Friday!

The EA SPORTS FIFA production team has opened the floodgates by releasing the first batch of FIFA 18 Player Ratings. The released list is comprised of FUT's top 100-81 players, plus a few other notable stars that came to light in a video featuring Futhead comments. 
Liverpool standout Sadio Mane's rating increased significantly from 79 at the start of FIFA 17 to 84. Other major upgrades include Dele Alli, who received a massive +4 boost from where he was a year ago at this time, and Yannick Carrasco who increased by three since the start of FUT 17.
Aging defenders Vincent Kompany, Andrea Barzagli and Dani Alves took negative rating hits as their overalls dropped while Ilkay Gundogan kept his 85 overall rating even though he failed to feature for Manchester City during their 16/17 EPL campaign due to injury. 
Images from EA SPORTS's latest video offered players beyond the initially released Top 100-81 as well. Juventus stars Giorgio Chiellini (89) and Paulo Dybala (88) saw their ratings increase. Apart from his +2 boost from his Winter Upgrade, Dybala had a position change, switching from a forward to a CAM.
Bayern Munich fans can breathe easy as only one of their stars took a bit of a negative ratings hit. Thomas Müller fell by one while Manuel Neuer and Arturo Vidal remained the same. Both Arjen Robben and Thiago received upgrades. 
Make sure to keep a consistent eye on Futhead over the next few weeks. We'll be posting all of the lastest FIFA 18 ratings as they are released."

Yesterday 60 new players found were added to FUT, a combination of new and old faces.
Demba Ba returns having skipped FIFA 16 with a nasty leg break.

Emmanuel Adebayor makes his first FIFA 17 appearance, in FUT.

And I suppose I should also mention the return of Nicklas Bendtner which will no doubt be met with a mixture of hysteria and eye rolling as the same comment is posted over, and over, and over again.

There's plenty more to pick through although some of the stats/details are a little off at the moment, particularly ages. You can view all 60 here."

Last week's score: 12/23
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad Link:http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7826023/


Goalkeeper
David Ospina - GK - OVR 79
The goalkeepers are often a scary task during the international break and this was no different. I have two options from South America, but in truth I really did struggle. Ospina made six saves in a disappointing 0-0 draw against Venezuela. 
Defenders
Thomas Meunier - RWB - OVR 77
Despite Belgium only playing Gibraltar, it was still impressive what Meunier achieved for them. Playing in the RWB role allowed him to attack, but to claim three goals and three assists from that position is beyond impressive. In my four years of predicting sides, I believe this is the highest statistical performance from a defender. 
Andrew Robertson - LB - OVR 75
The fact that Robertson is now playing his football for Liverpool significantly helps his case for a spot in this side. The Scottish international helped them to pick up a crucial three points away at Lithuania courtesy of a 3-0 win.
Daley Blind- LB - OVR 81
Although the Netherlands were hammered midweek against France, I have two players selected from them this week. The first is Blind, after he claimed two assists in their 3-1 win. Should one miss out, I feel it will be Blind, with the sheer amount of options in his position, but with two attacking contributions, he stands above the rest.
Midfielders
Thomas Lemar - LM - OVR 80
Although the price tag did seem a little high with a supposedly accepted bid of 92m being agreed, it was a strange change of heart from Arsenal's Arsene Wenger that broke that reported deal none the less. He may well be kicking himself now after another top performance from the still Monaco winger, as he banged in two on his international duty during France's 4-0 domination of the Netherlands.
William Carvalho - CM - OVR 84
The first of two Portuguese players I have selected for their 5-1 home win over the Faroe Islands is Carvalho. Although Portugal were clear favourites to win this match, the Lisbon midfielder still put in a shift, scoring once and assisting another and thus in a limited selection process, such as the internationals, he stands out.
Christian Eriksen - CAM - OVR 85
Poland have been one of the better lesser sides of recent times but Denmark really did put them back in their place on Friday managing a convincing 4-0 home win. The man pulling the strings was of course Spurs' Christian Eriksen, who scored one of his own alongside assisting another two to claim man of the match.
Isco - RW - OVR 84
One of the higher profile matches of the week saw Spain host Italy. It was the home side which came out on top by the score line of three goals to nil, from which Isco scored twice. Should he make the final cut, which he looks odds on to do, it will be the Spaniards ninth special item of the game; crazy!
Forwards
Cristiano Ronaldo - ST - OVR 94
Although Ronaldo already has the maximum number of ratings available to him, both 98 rated items fall under different categories to that of an IF and thus technically he can be included. With it being the end of the year, I don't think there will be too many complaints if he does make it. After scoring three times for Portugal in a 5-1 win, he has a shout for doing just that.
Romelu Lukaku - ST - OVR 84
Belgium ran riot against Gibraltar managing to put nine past them without reply. This of course resulted in half the side being up for selection. However I have selected just the two, of which Lukaku is the second player to score a hat trick, which almost certainly means we will be seeing an IF United Lukaku.
Harry Kane - ST - OVR 85
There’s no denying that England have had some soft IFs from international breaks over the years, and thus I expect that to continue with Kane, who scored three times over the two games. Of course, this means we are now out of August and thus expect plenty more Kane goals over the coming weeks.
Substitutes
Guillermo Ochoa - GK - OVR 80
As stated with Ospina, both keepers selected co/me from the South American games; the second is Memo Ochoa. Unlike Ospina's Colombia, Mexico managed to win their game. But with just the five saves to his name, none of which were overly impressive, its purely a statistical punt on my behalf.
Chris Philipps - CB - OVR 60
This one’s a bit of a guess, seeing as Luxembourg's keeper, who was the obvious choice, is not in FIFA. I feel as though they deserve some recognition for holding France to a 0-0 draw though, and thus have opted for Philipps, who occupied a CB role for them. In total, the defender made four tackles, cleared one off the line, and made a colossal twenty clearances. 
Josh Magennis - RM - OVR 65
Whoever ends up playing San Marino usually claims an IF in the following week, and that looks to be the case once again after NI beat them, 3-0. Magennis, who was occupying a wide right role, scored two of their three goals and looks set to become a very good silver IF.
Hakim Ziyech - LM - OVR 81
Had Ziyech not have recently picked up his third IF of the season, he would have been a certainty for this side. But because he did, it becomes less clear cut. With it being towards the end of the game, and a potential positional change, I feel as though less emphasis will be put on this though and thus making him available. As for what he did, he scored twice and assisted another in Morocco’s 6-0 home win over Mali.
Shaquile Coulthirst - ST - OVR 63
With the English lower leagues all in action, it was almost inevitable that we would see a player from them feature this week. The decision became that much easier with Coulthirst scoring three of Barnet's goals in a 4-1 away win over Swindon.
Charlie Wyke - ST - OVR 61
In my eyes, this one’s a tad pointless seeing as though Wyke already has a 64 rated TOTS item. But considering it has happened before, we could easily see a 63 rated or a worse 64 rated IF. After the English forward scored all three of Bradford’s goals in their 3-1 win, there’s no question about him deserving it.
Chris Wood - ST - OVR 72
Continuing the theme of players who already have TOTS items, we have Chris Wood, who also scored a hat trick. This one’s a little less pointless, seeing as though he has both a club and division switch. But even then, he is still capped due to the 74 TOTS item he already has. 
Reserves
Miljat Gacinovic - RWB - OVR 70
Serbia hosted Moldova, which was always likely to result in a home three points. Serbia didn't disappoint and came away with a 3-0 win. Gajinovic stood out claiming both a goal and an assist from what I believe was a RWB position.
Thomas Delaney - CM - OVR 76
A second Danish IF now. Unlike the others though, this one comes from a separate match. Eriksen once again shone with a goal and an assist, but Delaney was the real star on Monday scoring three times from central midfield to secure a 4-1 win over Armenia. 
Davy Propper - CM - OVR 78
The Netherlands quickly regrouped from their mid-week hammering against France with a 3-1 home win over Bulgaria. There are a few Dutch players which stand a chance, but the best one is Brighton’s new boy, Propper, who scored two of the three goals.
Kei Kamara - ST - OVR 77
The MLS is one of the few leagues still in action during the international break and from it Kamara becomes a certainty for the side after scoring three of four New England goals in a 4-0 win.
Haris Seferovic - ST - OVR 76
Seferovic, who now plays his trade over in Portugal for Benfica, still occupies that lone ST role for Switzerland despite many arguing that they have better options. While he continues to score goals, he still deserves to be in contention internationally. Another two were added to his tally on Thursday during a 3-0 win over Andorra for the Swiss."

Market Overview
Over the past week, the One to Watch market dominated the Ultimate Team sphere, with every YouTuber and Twitter Trader hyping up the Winter OTW squad, as well as speculating about the OTW Squad Builder Challenges. After a little uncertainty, EA blessed us with both promotions today meaning the OTW market is firmly in the FUT spotlight. 
All the attention drove OTW prices sky high, as investors snapped upped items they believed would be needed as an SBC requirement. In the end, they were right, and the price of most items has shot up even more! With so much hype in one area, things can get a little dicey, so keep reading to give yourself the best chance to maximize your profit during this bountiful OTW promotions. 
Winter OTW Rundown

Overall, EA’s choices for the new Ones to Watch squad weren't unexpected with a solid BPL lean. There were some odd ball inclusions including Milot Rashica, Paul Georges Ntep, Khouma Babacar and Ahmed Musa. The preceding players, with the exception of Babacar, have the common denominator of pace, but it just feels a little bit like forced league diversity.

Besides that nitpicky gripe, we think this side features a pretty alright balance of players who will hopefully reward the community, and perform better than last years Winter batch. The elite items will surely be expensive, but if you are a hype investor there are no better candidates. If any player in those top two rows graps a goal or assist, expect massive price swings.
With that intoxicating final thought, the future looks bright for most of these items.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data that I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:   Take some of these values with a grain of salt considering the lower end items are all higher than this; but paying attention to the differences amongst the elites, Alexandre Lacazette and Corentin Tolisso seem to have potential if they can fianlly stablilize.
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take:  Besides Neymar, volatility was pretty compact across the list. That speaks to pre-event price trends that might be interesting to remember for next year. Since prices stayed relatively static, it was a great time to trade on open bid.  

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: This week's beta could be helpful when looking to estimate player prices post-OTW promotion. So, with that in mind make sure to offload players like Franck Kessie, Bruma and Douglas Costa who seem to be poised for drastic price drops.
TOTW Shout
No concrete Team of the Week worthy performances. Don’t be too sad though considering most items didn’t need real life actions to raise their value this week.
In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner - Every 82 OVR & Below 
Every OTW item rated 82 and below is this week’s big winner considering all their prices have exploded! It would be unfair to select just one winner, but make sure to note that all of the players that fit this rating category are at all time highs. 
Don’t get greedy by holding out for profit, and make sure to slowly list your items as mass listing will just panic the market and drive prices lower. Looking to the near future, make sure you sell off your investments by mid week, or else you run the risk of getting caught in the steep drop that’ll undoubtedly come next Friday. 
So stay smart when listing your items, and make sure to bask in that profit. You deserved it!
Big Loser -James Rodriguez (Bayern Munich) 
We’ve started to get a little sick of picking on Leonardo Bonucci, so the next porr fellow is James Rodriguez.The Colombian has been in fine form lately; however, he is our biggest loser due to a combination of his weekly return (-8.6%) and general outlook. 
Examining his weekly stats, James has both a middling volatility (~7,000) and beta (0.24). Similar to other cases of medium stats, it seems the ex-Monaco CAM is set to hold his value with limited price fluctuation in either direction. So, it looks like purchasing Rodriguez is for investors who want to bet on his real life performances, and that is always tricky. If he doesn’t generate some hype in the next few weeks, investors could be looking at some steady losses. 
Of course that is a conservative outlook, and James has done pretty well in the Bundesliga. But, for all the players like him,  it is starting to get to that time of year when OTW items start losing value as domestic leagues start winding down. 
Recap & outlook
There was a lot to cover in this week’s update. To bring it to a concise conclusion, EA released their new batch of Winter OTW items alongside special OTW Squad Builder Challenges. That perfect storm of hype and demand led to player prices’ rising dramatically. Looking to the future, there will be a lot more names on these updates going forward, but also be cautious of sharp price declines next Friday.  Some interesting final thoughts:
-- OTW traders: Now is the time to test out those trigger fingers. Sniping could be a lucrative trade at the moment, but it will require loads of patience.  

-- OTW investors: Prices are exceptionally high for the Summer items. That being said, towards the end of the week some Winter OTW items might be undervalued
Please share your thoughts on the new Ones to Watch promotion, and also let us know who you’d love to see pick up a couple informs?!  Don’t neglect the OTW market’s younger brother, the Path to Glory market, so check out our PTG update too!

                        Welcome to my weekly Ones to Watch update and analysis! I’ve combed through the schedules of all the players with OTW items and organized their game times and likelihood of starting into a handy spreadsheet.
                    

It is fair to say that Ones to Watch items have been a major hit in FIFA 17. In particular, the trading and investing community has taken to these cards because of the relative ease at which you can earn coins by trading with them. We have seen many investors earn millions off of well-timed OTW trades!
I’ve prepared the OTW list for the weekend of 28-31th April to help you trade this weekend. Keep in mind, although some players are likely to start, I can obviously not guarantee that they will start. 
Predictions are taken from Whoscored.com.
Players that have been in form lately
M'Baye Niang: Always in the starting lineup and has been efficient to score and assist lately. 
Gonzalo Higuain: Higuain just can’t stop scoring. Always In the starting lineup and nearly scores every game. 
Gerard Deulofeu: Always in the starting lineup. Has been tremendous after he came to AC Milan. Keep an eye on his game. 
Jese: Has been performing lately and you should keep an eye on him. 
Leroy Sané: Always in the starting lineup and he is very efficient to score and assist his teammates.
Injury updates
Paul Pogba (Manchester United): Missed the derby on Thursday and is a doubt for the game this weekend. Has been dealing with a hamstring injury. 

Paul Ntep (Wolfsburg): Has missed 9 games due to an injury. Very bad injury as he has torn muscle bundle. Expected to return around 10. May 2017. 
Mamadou Sakho (Crystal Palace): Picked up a bad injury in the game vs Tottenham on Wednesday. As of now we have no news of the injury. This is a very serious injury and he could be out for the season. 
Gabriel Jesus (Manchester City): Has been injured for a long time but has started training. He suffered a fractured metatarsal. Could return to the field before the end of the season. 
Sadio Mané (Liverpool): Out for the season
Luiz Adriano (Spartak Moscow): He is still undergoing treatment for his injury and is a doubt for the game vs Rostov. 
Breel Embolo (Schalke): Has been injured since October. He is expected to be fit before the end of the season. 

How to Trade with OTW Players
So, now that I’ve peaked your curiosity, I’m sure you are wondering how exactly to trade with OTW cards. There are two main methods that have proven to work every single week.
This first method is to take advantage of bad performances. When a player performs badly (a main indicator is the team losing or the player earning a poor whoscored match rating) his price tends to drop after the game, presumably because many investors and casual players panic sell the card. This provides an opportune window to pick the card up for cheap. Then, throughout the week, his price will slowly rise until game day. While it may be tempting to hold the player until he earns an inform, remembering the pattern from last week, we will want to sell the player on before the next game actually starts (a good time to sell is usually when he is announced in the starting lineup). The reason why we do that is because if he doesn’t perform well in the first 30-45 minutes his price will start to drop as it did the week prior. This is called selling in the hype.
The second method is more profitable but requires more attention. What you have to do is either watch the game that the OTW is playing or you have notifications turned on, on your phone or computer, that notify you straight away when there is a goal. If a OTW player scores in the game his price will skyrocket. However, picking up the player is not easy and you have to be quick. The time frame to pick up a player when he scores is constantly becoming smaller. At this stage in the game, you have around 20 seconds to pick up the player before your room for profit is gone. After these 20 seconds, his price will have already inflated and he won’t be worth picking up.
Trading with OTW players has never been as popular as it is now. This is not only going to make you profit, but it is also entertaining! The key is selling into the hype and not getting caught holding a card too long because of greed. Slow, steady profits will win the race in the long run.
Best of luck!

The final FIFA Mobile Community Team of the Month for August is finally here. Will it be the last one ever?
While it remains to be seen, the fifth and final token required to chase the August Player of the Month is upon us with a cTOTW in honor of ""Damon_IX-XI"". From the ""Hong Kong"" league -- and no stranger to near the top of the leader board -- Damon finally broke through, claiming what may be the final team selected in honor of a communtiy member this Summer.
Though a Dortmund player doesn't make it three-for-free (which presents all kinds of licensing questions about POTM with BVB's agreement with Konami/PES) over the past three weeks, a second centerback this month claims the honor, this time in the form of Manchester United's Eric Bailly. Bailly joins Giorgio Chiellini, Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and American wunderkind Christian Pulisic, and Schalke 04 winger Yevgen Konoplyanka.
We'll have to stay tuned to see if there's a Player of the Month for September or if EA pivots in another direction.
Here's the full fifth August Community Team of the Week:
-- GK 82 OVR Stefan Frei
-- CB 90 OVR César Azpilicueta
-- CB 86 OVR Ştefan Radu
-- RWB 90 OVR Héctor Bellerín
-- CAM 92 OVR Adam Lallana
-- CAM 84 OVR Juan Fernando Quintero
-- CM 87 OVR Emre Can

Last week's score: 16/23
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad Link: http://www.futhead.com/18/squads/2345682/


Goalkeeper
Mattia Perin - GK - OVR 83
With the Italian league being one of the few leagues playing I expect several to be included in this side. With the options are severely limited which makes it hard for me and leaves the door open for some random inclusions. One player who I can predict is Perin. The Genoa stopper made a total of six saves to keep a clean sheet and pick up a 7.5 from Gazzetta.
Defenders
Nathan Ake - CB - OVR 75
 In what was a dramatic end to the match, with three goals in the final ten minutes of the game, Bournemouth v West Ham ended level with three goals apiece. Ake was involved in two of the home sides goals, both scoring one and assisting another. He picked up MOTM by doing so and although Arnautovic was heavily involved for West Ham with multiple PL strikers already included I think he will miss out in favour of Ake. 
Dejan Lovren - CB - OVR 81
The first of three predicted Liverpool players to be predicted this week in Lovren. The Croatian provided the assist on Klavan's (who is also a contender) 94th minute winner. Burnley will feel hard done by after coming away empty handed but it is Liverpool who continue their impressive form.
Silvan Widmer - RWB - OVR 77
This one is a tad risky seeing as it could be interpreted that Widmer played in a RM role but with a lack of options I am willing to take the punt on him. The Swiss man scored one of Udinese's 2-1 away win.
Midfielders
Mohamed Salah - RW - OVR 83
The Egyptian just can't stop tearing up the Premier league. Leicester took an early lead against Liverpool, but Salah had other ideas about the match, scoring two second half goals to lead them to another win. I think with his IF being 86 and the POTM being 88 that he will be 87 rated.
Marek Hamsik - CM - OVR 87
I mentioned that I expect a few random Calcio A inclusions this week and one of those I am predicting to be Hamsik. The Slovakian has been on form as of late and scored another goal in Napoli's 1-0 win on Friday to help them continue the chase at the top.
Paul Pogba - CM - OVR 87
Pogba makes a difference to the United side when on the field and although it has taken him a few games to settle in since returning from injury he put in another brilliant shift in United's 2-0 win over Everton, providing the assist on both goals.
 Paulo Dybala - RW - OVR 88
There is some debate about Dybala's actual position with contrasting line ups everywhere you look. What's not up for debate is his inclusion after he scored two of three Juventus goals in a 3-1 win.
Dele Alli - CAM - OVR 84
One of a few players that I am predicting to pick up an IF from Tuesday matches after they were not counted last week is Alli This one comes against Southampton of which Spurs ran away as 5-2 winners. Alli picked up a goal and assist in that match and although Kane was MOTM, Alli was also instrumental.
Forwards
Alexis Sanchez - LF - OVR 89
There is some debate over whether Tuesdays fixtures will count but with Arsenal playing their match on Tuesday, I am sure that match will be taken into consideration. Sanchez scored twice in a 3-2 win over Palace and with it being the same formation as last time, likely to be included as a LF.
Roberto Firmino - ST - OVR 83
With three games being registered in the selection period for Liverpool they were always likely to pick up some IF's. Firmino makes it three from three for his brace in their 5-0 win over Swansea.
Substitutes
Ederson - GK - OVR 83
Some may say that it should be Palace picking up an IF after stopping City's consecutive winning streak, but City are still unbeaten and that is largely down to Ederson. The Brazilian made a last-minute penalty save in ensure that was the case which left the game goalless. 
Robert Snodgrass- RM - OVR 76
Continuing with yet another right sided midfielder we have Snodgrass. Villa recorded a convincing 5-0 win at home to Bristol City. Snodgrass scored both the second and third of those goals helping to secure the three points.
Willian - RW - OVR 84
For the second week running I am predicting Willian to pick up his first IF. With Tuesdays games seemingly being ignored last week Willian's goal and two assists come into consideration for selecting this side. The Brazilian repeated his feat in the second set of fixtures, again scoring once and assisting two in a 5-0 win over Stoke.
Jesse Lingard -CAM - OVR 78
Lingard has picked up some serious form as of late after being average at best over the past couple of season. He has now scored seven goals in his last nine games. Two came on Tuesday in a 2-2 draw with Burnley and another was added to his tally in United's 2-0 win over Everton.
Marc Albrighton - LM - OVR 77
Although once again it was Mahrez who stood out for Leicester, recorded yet another goal and assist to his name with it being just a two-week gap between his previous IF I can't see him picking up another so soon. Due to that I am opting for the next best option in Albrighton. Like Mahrez he picked up a goal and assist as Leicester went on to beat Huddersfield 3-0.
Marko Arnautovic - ST - OVR 82
Another player who is in form right now is Marko Arnautovic. Since Moyes has taken over the Austrian has played in a more advanced role and with that has seen some of the form that we have seen in previous seasons. He scored twice in the previously mentioned 3-3 draw with Bournemouth which with the lack of options should be enough for him.
Fabio Quagliarella - ST - OVR 78
The final inclusion from the Italian top division comes from Sampdoria's 2-0 home win over Spal. Fabio scored both and both came in the late on, the first in the 92nd followed by another in the 94th minute. Talk about snatch and grab.
Reserves
Daniel Ayala - CB - OVR 73
Yet another addition from the Championship now with Ayala. The Spaniard scored twice for Middlesborough in their narrow 3-2 win over Preston. Despite conceding twice with two offensive contributions to his name he becomes difficult to overlook.
Ryan Fraser - LM - OVR 73
Bournemouth finally ended their run without a win, which was at eight consecutive PL games, with a 2-1 win over Everton. Fraser scored both of those goals, the second of which was an 88th minute winner. 
Mostafa Fathi - RM - OVR 67
It's been a while since we have seen a Saudi league representative but with Fathi scoring a hat trick from midfield we are likely to see one on Wednesday. It came in Al Taawon's 4-0 home win on Friday.
Lewis Alessandra - ST - OVR 66
With the sheer amount of lower league fixtures over the festive period I was shocked when not even one hat trick was scored from the ST position. Alessandra was the only one who managed a brace and an assist though and thus with that being the next best thing I have him ahead of others.
Abdoulay Diaby - ST - OVR 72
Although I didn’t predict him myself either I am happy to say that Diaby was robbed last week after scoring twice and assisting another in a 5-0 win over Anderlecht. With that being said it doesn't officially count towards this week’s side I think it will be a factor. Diaby scored another two goals this week as Brugge recorded a 4-2 win."

                        Welcome to my weekly Ones to Watch update and analysis! I’ve combed through the schedules of all the players with OTW items and organized their game times and likelihood of starting into a handy spreadsheet.  
                    

OTW Weekend is brought to you by @GummiFifa!
It is fair to say that Ones to Watch items have been a major hit in FIFA 17. In particular, the trading and investing community has taken to these cards because of the relative ease at which you can earn coins by trading with them. We have seen many investors earn millions off of well-timed OTW trades!
How to Trade with OTW Players
So, now that I’ve peaked your curiosity, I’m sure you are wondering how exactly to trade with OTW cards. There are two main methods that have proven to work every single week.
This first method is to take advantage of bad performances. When a player performs badly (a main indicator is the team losing or the player earning a poor whoscored match rating) his price tends to drop after the game, presumably because many investors and casual players panic sell the card. This provides an opportune window to pick the card up for cheap. Then, throughout the week, his price will slowly rise until game day. While it may be tempting to hold the player until he earns an inform, remembering the pattern from last week, we will want to sell the player on before the next game actually starts (a good time to sell is usually when he is announced in the starting lineup). The reason why we do that is because if he doesn’t perform well in the first 30-45 minutes his price will start to drop as it did the week prior. This is called selling in the hype.
The second method is more profitable but requires more attention. What you have to do is either watch the game that the OTW is playing or you have notifications turned on, on your phone or computer, that notify you straight away when there is a goal. If a OTW player scores in the game his price will skyrocket. However, picking up the player is not easy and you have to be quick. The time frame to pick up a player when he scores is constantly becoming smaller. At this stage in the game, you have around 20 seconds to pick up the player before your room for profit is gone. After these 20 seconds, his price will have already inflated and he won’t be worth picking up.
Trading with OTW players has never been as popular as it is now. This is not only going to make you profit, but it is also entertaining! The key is selling into the hype and not getting caught holding a card too long because of greed. Slow, steady profits will win the race in the long run.
As mentioned above, to help you trade this weekend, I’ve prepared a OTW spreadsheet. Keep in mind, although some players are likely to start, I can obviously not guarantee that they will start. These are just predictions based on their performance lately.

After a number of leaks from the FIFA 18 beta, EA have now confirmed themselves exactly what we can expect to see from Career Mode in FIFA 18. And there's a lot to get through:
NEW TRANSFERS
Many of us saw those rather swish cut scenes doing the rounds on Twitter -- which aren't mandatory -- where your Career Mode manager will now meet in person with representatives of the selling club to thrash out a deal in true lifelike Frostbite fashion. On a more practically note, all of the negotiations you start are now driven through a combined transfer hub as well. That means you can now keep track of all your deals in real time, and in one place without having to scroll back through reams of emails to remember who you've bid for.
Whilst most of the above is centred on improving the presentation and organisation of transfers in Career Mode, there's also a raft of new options which have been added to the transfer deals and contracts themselves where you can now set up:
•   Sell-on clauses
•   Release clauses
•   Appearance bonuses
•   Goal bonuses
•   Clean sheet bonuses
Above all the fancy cut scenes, these are what excites me most about the changes to Career Mode transfers, because the community have been crying out for this type of depth for a number of years now. These new clauses and bonuses are in addition to the options we already have, so you'll still need to agree squad roles, wages and contract length as normal.
As you can imagine there's now a much bigger canvas for us to work with as a virtual managers and whether it's blockbuster signings, or cut price bargains you're after; there are now plenty of different ways to work your transfer magic. I think sell-on clauses especially could put a much greater emphasis on youth payers because could profit from their development years after they've left your club. That's certainly going to be the case if you enjoy starting Career Mode in the lower leagues anyway. Either that, or you’ll set an astronomical Release Clause only for PSG to turn up and ruin your day.
My issue with transfers in Career Mode (17) is that they're usually a one-and-done affair, which doesn't represent any of the twists and turns we see (especially today) in even the most straight forward transfers. The more options we have at our disposal, the more opporuntities there are for drmatic things to happen, and hopefully these new mechanics can breath life in to one of the best parts of being a manager in Career Mode. 

DYNAMIC NEWS
Once you do manage to sign someone, these moments are now brought to life through Career Modes Dynamic News Clips (as you can see in the title image) which will showcase the player and manager completing that all-important deal just like in real life. You'll see these types of announcements splashed across the whole Career Mode as part of the news billboards, and the same system also drives similar scenes when someone in your squad wins Player of the Month.

NEW TRAINING
Training has also received a welcome shot in the arm, with over 15 new training drills available for you to choose from. As well as that, you can now assign training drills to groups as well as individuals, and training can also be used to aid in player recovery after a long injury layoff.
For me Career Mode never really dishes out enough injuries to cause genuinely selection headaches, so hopefully EA have looked at providing some greater balance generally to make systems like the new injury recovery training really shine.
QUICK SUBS
Another new addition to the in-match Career Mode experience are Quick Subs. Which allow you to pre-set substitute behaviour prior to the match beginning. So if you have let’s say a journeyman striker who can only last 70 minutes, you can now have his usual replacement lined up and ready to come on automatically without leaving the match. When the appropriate time of the match rolls around you can then choose to confirm your Quick Sub, or you can cancel it if the match situation requires a different change.
For me, most what makes managing a team in Career Mode interesting is about responding to live situations as they happen. So in that sense Quick Subs may not add the value they initially appear to. But, as a general rule I'm sure we all have regular substitute patterns within our squads and therefore having a system in place which smooths out that manual processes is certnly a plus point.

TEAM STYLES
Team Styles are something I've wanted in Career Mode for as long as I can remember, and finally they make their appearance in FIFA 18. EA haven't provided a great deal of clarity around exactly how they work (or if there are new custom tactics options) but what we do know is that there will be set styles to cover counter attack, quick pass, direct and harass play styles. So fans of Jurgen Klopp’s gegenpressing should be well catered for. 
As always with changes to behaviour and AI it's all about the implementation. But for the longevity of Career Mode, where by definition you have to string potentially hundreds of offline games together to get the most out of it. Variation in the teams you come up against is an absolute must. EA have always seemed unmoved by this type of AI based behaviour in the past, but hopefully this is the start of a journey where EA's offline gameplay environments get some long overdue depth and excitement.

SUMMARY
Overall I think that's a pretty good reveal line-up for Career Mode all things considered, with a number of high priority issues addressed (team styles, transfers) combined with a few surprises we perhaps weren't expecting to see (cut scenes). What makes Career Mode a success however is not how each of these feature behaves in isolation. It’s how the entire ecosystem gels and as such that makes it one of the hardest modes in FIFA to judge until you've got several seasons of action under your belt. 
From that point of view, we all now need to wait for September 29 to see just how well EA have managed to weave these new features in to the ones which are already there. If (and it’s a bit of a big if) EA have done that well enough, it could be one of the most complete Career Mode experiences we’ve had in an awful long time."

            Updated on
            



Today we'll be taking a look at TOTS Mike Jensen.

The Rosenborg BK captain has a 74-rated base card, but has accumulated a 74-rated inform, an unlockable 80-rated POTY card, and now this 87-rated TOTS card. With 87+ on five of his six card stats, as well as a very respectable 78 defending, Jensen is one of the most well-rounded players you can use this year (he has the 21st most card stats of any CAM/CM/CDM).
His in-game rating is no joke either. Without even receiving a chemistry boost, he is 82+ rated in every position on the field, with an 86+ rating in all attacking positions. Throw a basic chemistry style on him, and he moves up to 85+ rated in all positions, and 89+ rated in all attacking positions.

Here are my stats with this TOTS Jensen card:
Price: 40,000
Games: 14 (Div. 1 and DKT)
Goals: 8
Assists: 3
Chemistry Style: Basic
Here is the squad I used him in: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7035779/

I've used Jensen's 80-rated POTY card as a super-sub all game long, so I have a considerable amount of experience using his cards, and he remains one of my favorite midfielders in the game.
Let's get into his pros and cons.
Pros:


Pace: He's ridiculously fast in game. This allows him to carry the ball forward very quickly, dart into space in an instant, or catch up with attackers in a flash and dispossess them. His pace is easily one of his best stats, and he feels even faster than 87 pace in game.


Long Shots: From anywhere within 30 yards, he's lethal. His POTY card had some of the best shots I've used his year, and this card is just ridiculous. His long shots are accurate and powerful, and most importantly, consistent. Just power up, aim for the far post, and let lose.


Finishing: His shot power carries over to this stat, and makes his shots in and around the box ridiculous. Low driven shots, as well as straight-up power shots, are lethal. He can hammer them past the keeper before they even have time to react.


Passing: This card can pull off any kind of pass. You can consistently play short passes, easily ping long balls, burst into space and whip in a cross, or split the defense with a through ball. He's a wonderful link up player, and someone who can open up a defense by himself.


Dribbling: Feels incredible in game. He's agile, great on the ball, has a perfect first touch, and incredible reactions. He turns instantly, stops in the blink of an eye, and can weave through defenses with ease.


Defending: Feels like 85+ in game. His interceptions are ridiculous, and his pace allows him to cut out passes, breaking up the play. His tackling is incredible - he dispossesses other players with ease, and rarely gives away a foul.


Physicality: Awesome. His stamina is incredible, allowing him to run from the first to the last minute. His strength and aggression are game-changing. He can hold off almost any other player in this game, and wins almost every 50-50 challenge he goes into. Throw in the 75 jumping (which feels much higher in game), and you have an absolute tank.


Cons:


Finesse shots: I'm really reaching here, but his finesse shots aren't too great. He's not fantastic from tight angles, and he just doesn't seem to be able to generate much curve on his shots.


3-star skills: Once again, I'm sort of reaching here, but 4-star skills would be nice. He's not limited by the 3-star skills, just because of his pace, dribbling and physicality, but I always feel like I need those 4-star skills to get out of tight situations.


Difficulty in linking him: The big one. There aren't too many great players in his league, and while there are some great Danish players, they are sorely lacking in many positions. As a result, he's hard to fit into your main team on 10 chemistry, unless you surround him with some silvers sub-par golds. That being said, he's still ridiculous on 8-chemistry.


Overall, this is an incredible card. For ~30K, you are getting one of the better midfielders in this game, and one of the best super-subs around. For his price, he's someone you definitely should try out. I guarantee you'll love him.

                        Headlining in week 33 we have James Rodriguez, Diego Costa, Gary Cahill and yet another Thauvin.
                    

Last week's score: 17/23
Formation: 3-4-2-1
Squad link:http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/6114413/

Goalkeeper
Timo Horn - GK - OVR 82
Koln played out a 0-0 draw with Dortmund in another low scoring game for the German outlet. It may have been another story had it not have been for Horn though. Koln's keeper was in inspired form making a total of four saves to keep the clean sheet. He was awarded with a 1.5 from Kicker making him keeper of the week.
Defenders
Gary Cahill - CB - OVR 83
Cahill scored in both of Chelsea's wins this week but specifically comes from their weekend win over Everton. Cahill scored the second of their three goals and helped to keep a clean sheet in their 3-0 away win. 
Benjamin Hubner - CB - OVR 75
Hubner scored a last-minute winner to lead Hoffenheim to a 1-0 win over Frankfurt helping him to claim a spot in Kickers TOTW. There are several other defenders who could also make the cut but seeing as it came late in the game I think that’s an additional motive to select the German.
Dani Alves - RB - OVR 85
Serie A offered next to nothing in terms of IF options and thus I am taking the punt on Alves. Although it was Juventus who dropped points thanks to a late equilser from Atalanta Alves was the joint highest scorer with a 7 after he scored on of Juve's two in a 2-2 draw. Juventus have picked up a lot of cheap IF's this year and I wouldn't be surprised to see another here.
Midfielders
Ricardo Pereira - RM - OVR 78
Nice really opened the title race in France this weekend with a 3-1 win over PSG, a result which puts them back in the title race and allowed Monaco to take the lead. Pereira claimed MOTM with an 8/10 for his goal and assist which against PSG I can't see missing out.
Halli Altintop - CAM - OVR 76
Augsburg recorded a convincing 4-0 win over Hamburg. Altintop scored both the first and second goals which saw him pick up a 1.5 rating from Kicker. Multiple midfielders picked up that mark however I think that Altintop will get the nod for his brace.
James Rodriguez - CM - OVR 87
You could argue that once again Isco was Madrid’s main man but with so many IF's already I can see him being snubbed in favour of another Madrid midfielder. Rodriguez is yet to pick up an IF so far, this FIFA and after he bagged himself a brace in their 6-2 away win over Deportivo now is the prime time for that.
Florian Thauvin - RW - OVR 81
It's been quite the season for Thauvin who added another two goals and an assist to his tally this weekend. The young French winger is likely to attract a lot of attention over the summer after developing into one of the best players in the league. He picked up another POTW award with an 8/10
Forwards
Diego Costa - ST - OVR 86
Chelsea recorded two wins from two this week which puts them that step closer to officially securing the title. The first of the two games is where Costa comes from after he scored twice and assisted another in their 4-2 win over Southampton.
Bas Dost - ST - OVR 80
Bas Dost continued his ridiculous run of form with a hat trick away at Braga which could end up being a big result come the end of the season keeping options open for Sporting should over results go their way. 
Paco Alcacer - ST - OVR 81
Barcelona picked up a massive 7-1 win during the BBVA's mid-week set of fixtures however there was still no stand out candidate for the IF. I have opted for Paco who scored two of the seven however Gomes is another viable option or even both at a push.
Substitutes
Thomas Strakosha - GK - OVR 64
With Keita being unable to pick up an IF due to being in the current week’s side Strakosha looks set to be the Lazio player. The keeper picked up an 8/10 from Gazzetta after he made five saves during Lazio's shock 3-1 away win over Roma who are now pretty much officially out of the title race.
Nico Schulz - LB - OVR 73
Schulz was given the more defensive role of LB for Gladbach this weekend however it was his offensive performance which gets him into this prediction after he both scored and assisted one each during a 2-1 win.
Saul - CM - OVR 80
Atletico recorded a comfortable 5-0 win away to Las Palmas on Saturday of which two players could potentially pick up an IF from. Firstly, it is Gameiro who missed out after his brace with myself opting for another player with two goals in Saul. Both players have a strong chance of making the cut but in this scenario, I usually opt for the player further back in the field.
Raul Garcia - CAM - OVR 81
Lots of high scoring BBVA fixtures over two game-weeks has inevitably resulting in a lot of IF's from the division. Garcia is another after he scored twice for Bilbao in an impressive 3-0 away win over Celta Vigo.
Mattia Destro - ST - OVR 78
As already stated Serie A offered very little and thus I am giving the nod to Destro over several other gold strikers which scored twice due to the league he’s is playing in. Destro's brace came in Bologna's impressive 4-0 win over Udinese.
Samuel Eto'o - ST - OVR 81
Eto'o remains a rather nostalgic addition to any TOTW and thus is always welcomed warmly and for once he fully deserves his spot after scoring a hat trick in his sides 5-2 away win. Potentially a re-release of his SBC in an IF version but quite difficult to tell how EA will play this one.
Cedric Bakambu - ST - OVR 81
I almost took the punt of Bakambu last week but that wouldn't have worked out. This time around I am going to predict the Villarreal striker though after he scored another two goals. This time they came in a 3-1 win over Gijon of which Bakambu picked up MOTM with 3 from Marca.
Reserves
Bjorn Paulsen - CAM - OVR 67
A bit of a punt but the last time I bottled a Swedish league player he made the cut so I don't want to make the same mistake twice. Paulsen was involved in three of Hammarby's goals with two of his own going alongside an assist.
Andrija Pavlovic - ST - OVR 61
There is still no set guide to which games count and which don’t in terms of promotion play off matches and with EA being very hit and miss with them over the last few years there is no indication whatsoever. When a hat trick occurs, they are always hard to ignore though and with Pavlovic scoring all three Copenhagen goals in a 3-0 win he makes my side.
Raul Ruidiaz- ST - OVR 73
Ruidiaz was always an outsider while creating the silver MC TOTS and it's just as well that he didn’t make the cut after the Peruvian scored a hat trick this weekend in his sides 4-0 win over UNAM.
Liam Boyce - ST - OVR 67
This season EA have started to ignore many hat tricks which are heavily penalty based and although two of Boyce's goals came from the spot the fact he scored four should stand out. The NI striker scored all four of Ross County's goals in their 4-0 home win over Inverness.
Guido Burgstaller - ST - OVR 75
Burgstaller picked up player of the week in Germany for his brace in Schalke's shock 4-1 away win over Leverkusen. The Austrian striker picked up a perfect 1 mark after he scored two of the four goals."

Today, we’re going to be talking about FIFA gameplay, which is probably the most sensitive topic of our Wish List schedule as a result of the community's less than glowing response to FIFA 18's various changes, tweaks, patches and updates.
In fact, there’s been a continuing narrative running throughout FIFA 18’s life cycle which has revolved around the belief that EA have ""fixed"" what wasn't broken in a game regarded as one of the best during launch week. There’s of course a lot more to the debate than merely that, but none the less, some pretty large issues likely need to be addressed looking ahead to FIFA 19. 
Responsiveness
For me, there’s a big difference between game speed and game responsiveness and it’s the latter which needs focus for FIFA 19. Currently, the speed at which the players and the ball move in FIFA 18 are all pretty much perfect. I think it would be nice to see more differentiation between the fastest and slowest players in the game, but we all know why EA tread that line very carefully. 
So, for me, the issue is with responsiveness. When the ball lands at our feet, how fast is the control and how fast is our ability to complete the next action? Right now, that process can feel incredibly sluggish in FIFA 18 with the “running through treacle” analogy used often to describe it. If you look at the speed at which real players can control the ball and then move, it’s very easy to see why our FIFA players feel blunted in comparison. 
Again, this is a very fine thing itself to balance because if we could all turn on a sixpence and instantly rifle off a shot then the experience would be broken. But where we need to arrive at is a place where FIFA 19 feels sharp, but has enough contextual error to counter increased responsiveness. So, if for example you hit a 180-degree first time pass completely blind, you should be punished for that decision with lots of pass error. If you instead take a touch and turn, you should be achieve a better outcome. 
This is a very deep technical problem for EA to resolve and of course network latency comes in to the equation for online play, but these perceptions around things like button lag, input delay and “running through treacle” aren’t just concocted by the community. They are tangible issues, and as a result, a more responsive gameplay experience should be one of if not the number one priorities for FIFA 19. 
Power Bar
One of the other complaints FIFA 18 has regularly been lambasted with is a “low skill gap”, and with the FUT Champions scene getting more traction it’s a concern which is going to grow until addressed. There are many things which contribute to a low skill gap in FIFA 18 and this suggestion only covers a portion of it, but for me personally it’s a big deal.

And it’s the power bar, which we all see at the bottom of our screen and yet are able to wilfully ignore for ninety virtual minutes. That’s because it is damn near impossible to under, or over hit a pass in FIFA 18. Even if you hold the button down for as long as the universe will allow, the pass is still going land on target. It might be more difficult for the receiver to control due to the pace it arrives, but 9 times out of 10 it will still be on target and that fact alone creates a lower skill barrier. 
If the power bar had a much wider range of input from the smallest tap, to the maximum powered pass it could solve two key problems. We as players would get to hone the skill of weighting passes properly and learn to use the 'right' players to make difficult passes, instead of every player on the pitch being equally capable. And secondly, it would also bring greater variety to the gameplay because even under hitting a single pass can create situations for new and exciting things to happen.
Right now, it's way too easy to ping the ball around with no consequences and if EA want the skill gap to increase, a more difficult to master Power Bar is one of the options they should look at. 
Gameplay Sliders
But how do you create a FIFA gameplay experience which pleases 15 million people? The short answer is you can’t, but that doesn’t mean EA can't provide the community with more tools to tweak the experience themselves. FIFA’s offline gameplay sliders have been identical for as long as I can remember and yet during the last few years alone, EA have added countless new features and ways to control the players. The slider options have quite simply not kept pace with that gameplay development. 
And they could be the key to unlocking some of the discontent around how FIFA plays, because if you don’t like the way the game meta is, there’s very little you can do about it. The current gameplay slider roster allows a degree of customisation but most of the benefits they offer are already well known, meaning their impact diminishes with each passing year. 
So, what we need for FIFA 19 are some new sliders to allow us to change even more of the football sandbox EA have created. I’d love to have sliders for AI aggression, AI pressing, how much form impacts the game, and I’m sure you guys can think of many more too. But for offline modes at least, an expanded offering of gameplay sliders would be huge for FIFA 19.

That's us done, so over to you in the comments below for your suggestions for FIFA 19's gameplay. We're eager to hear what you want to see in next year's game on that front."

Market Overview
A dynamic item market made big headlines this past week, but unfortunately it was not the Path to Glory one. Rather, its cousin, the Ones to Watch items, stole the show, and their promotion caused a dip in the general FUT market due to pack promos and new Squad Builder Challenges. 
Narrowing in on the PTG market, hopefully you took last week’s warning and sold into the hype considering this week saw huge price corrections. Most items were overvalued at the beginning of the week based on investor speculating their necessity for SBC requirements. The preceding practice is always dangerous, so in those cases sell into the hype! Just like any week where most cards dip, we’ll unpack the cause, and look forward to any opportunities. 
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  Big losses across the board, and with it came some large high/low differences. Be weary of cards like Marcus Rashford, Benedikt Howedes and William Carvalho considering their prices can plummet in an instant. 
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take:  The week following a big price shock can be pretty profitable for traders, so if you’re comfortable with the risk players like Kingsley Coman, Tiemoue Bakayoko and Alejandro Gomez could be worth the reward.
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of a card to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: This week our thoughts on beta focus on who we think could see a solid price rebound. Glancing at the figures, the best bet is in the likes of Leroy Sane, Sual and Rodrigo. Other large beta figures on players like Sandro Wagner, Emil Forsberg and Renato Sanches present more uncertainty at this point. 
TOTW Shout 
Nothing concrete this week, although Dimitri Payet has been quietly killing it for Marseille. Hopefully he gets rewarded soon. 
Big Winner - Giuliano (Fenerbahce)
Real tough decision this week! Or not really, as only two players would have been profitable based on their weekly returns. Although Raphael Varane deserves some credit, Giuliano is our big winner as he presents an interesting case study. 
A solid weekly return of 9.4%, was supported by medium volatility (~2,250) and large negative beta (-1.35) figures. The negative beta definitely reflects his performance compared to the PTG market, but it also indicates that going forward the ex-Zenit maestro could see a slight dip if the market rebounds. But, he big question is why did he stay positive?
If he still had five-star skills, the answer would be easy, but alas more thought is required. A combination of a return from injury and solid game time give investors confidence in the skillful Brazilian; however, more importantly Giuliano fell into that price range where he was too valuable for SBC investors, but not valuable enough to take a big hit from the general market dip.

Big Loser - William Carvalho (Sporting Lisbon)
In a devastating week, William Carvalho takes the cake as our biggest loser. With the poorest weekly return of -29.7%, Carvalho minimizes the dangerous of SBC requirement speculating, and should be a case study for similar situations in the future. 
If you sold him last week you made a pretty penny, but if you bought him last week I think I can hear your tears… There was never any certainty that PTG items would be useful for the OTW SBCs, but the hype got away from people. We would still love to see these items utilized in some fashion, but at the same time you have to stay smart about these things. 
Recap
Rough returns affirmed our doubts about the Path to Glory market from last week. When items are hyped as SBC requirements it is always best to sell into the hype. Although a week of negative returns is bitter on the tongue, it always presents an opportunity of new affordable items. Yet, with only real life performances to bet on, taking a week to see how PTGs settle might be best.           

Let us know if your thoughts on the Path to Glory market below!

                        TOTW 29 has potential for six 88+ rated players and a OTW item
                    

Last week's score: 15/23
Formation: 3-4-1-2. Squad link:http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/5561543/ 

Goalkeeper
Yann Sommer - GK - 84 OVR
It seems crazy that we will be seeing an 88 rated Sommer but it looks as though that is going to become a reality after he picked up a perfect 1 rating from Kicker. The Swiss keeper helped his 10 men to a 0-0 draw thanks to making four saves and a penalty. 
Defenders
Shkodran Mustafi - CB - 83 OVR
Mustafi has been in line for an IF on several occasions but this is by far his strongest shout. The German claimed both a goal and assist for Arsenal as they managed to secure a point in a 2-2 draw with Manchester City
Nacho Fernandez - LB -OVR 80
The first of two BBVA LB's to make my side is Nacho who scored one of Madrid's three goals in what was a routine 3-0 win over Leganes. There are multiple options for this spot but with the Madrid factor playing a part I feel as though Nacho will get the nod over the likes of Britos and Dier.
Felipe Luis - LB -OVR 85
The selection of Luis heavily involves his rating with a lack of big names performing that 88 rating his item contains will help to boost the side. Not to say that he doesn’t deserve an IF as a goal and a clean sheet is always impressive but there are arguably better options. I believe that EA will include him and that is what I am trying to predict at the end of the day.
Midfielders
Coutinho - LW - 86 OVR
It's safe to say that the Merseyside derby is one of the biggest in England and with the two clubs being closer together than ever it has that much more meaning to it. Liverpool came away as 3-1 winners with Coutinho coming back from injury to Instantly claim headlines with both a goal and an assist
Artur Ionita - CM -OVR 75
Ionita found himself on the score-sheet twice for Cagliari in their 3-1 away win over Palermo. A performance which resulted in the Moldavian midfielder receiving an 8/10 from Gazzetta.
Wilfried Zaha - RM -OVR 80
There are several options in terms of selecting an IF for Crystal Palace with Hennessey, Zaha and Benteke all performing well during their shock 2-1 win away at Chelsea. Zaha for me is the best option with the amount of goalkeeping options alongside the fact he picked up MOTM for his goal and assist.
Hakim Ziyech - CM - 80 OVR
It what could prove to be a pivotal match in the Dutch title race Ajax managed to record a 2-1 win over Feyenoord. Although Ziyech only picked up an assist on paper with the Moroccan claiming MOTM with an 8.5 in such a vital game I can see him getting the nod here.
Forwards
Robert Lewandowski - ST -OVR 90
A familiar face now in Lewandowski and yet another world class performance to go alongside his name. The Polish striker was involved in five goals as Munich went on to hammer Augsburg 6-0. Three goals and two assists to his name, more than enough for a 95 item.
Alejandro Gomez  - ST -OVR 81
Talking of familiar faces Gomez is becoming one in terms of TOTW. Another hat trick on Sunday means he is in line for what would be his fourth IF of the year and truth be told it could have and probably should have been more.
Edin Dzeko - ST -OVR 81
Dzeko continued his impressive form this season with another two goals in Roma's 2-0 win. He claimed a 7.5 from Gazzetta however with the lack of gold striker options that could well be enough to see him included
Substitutes
Benoit Costil - GK - 82 OVR
Rennes were reduced to 10 men from as early as the 5th minute. Costil managed to save the resulting penalty and went on to make another five saves as they managed to secure a 1-1 draw with Lyon.
Danny Simpson - RB - 75 OVR
Carrying on with the theme of BPL defenders we have Simpson who picked up both assists on the Leicester goals in their 2-0 win over Stoke.
Thomas Delaney - CM -OVR 76
Delaney picked up Bundesliga POTW thanks to his role in Werder Bremen’s 5-2 away win over Frieburg of which he scored three and assisted another. This result helped WB to their 4th win in five which in turn has helped them climb away from the relegation zone.
Scott Sinclair - RW -OVR 75
We are yet to see what EA are going to do regarding title winners this season and although they were very hit and miss during 16 after Sinclair scored a hat trick during Celtic's 5-0 win which secured them the title this won't really be an indication. Sinclair will be in the side as a hero or not is yet to be seen.
Giuseppe Rossi - ST -OVR 79
Monday games seem to be a thing of the past judging from recent selections however I am taking the risk once again with this one after Rossi managed a hat trick for Vigo in their 3-1 win, seeing the Italian pick up 3 from Marca.
Mario Gomez - ST -OVR 82
Although Wolfsburg failed to win the match the fact that Gomez scored three goals and picked up a 1 from Kicker pretty much makes him a certainty for this side. Can always do with an excuse to press the Mario Gomez button.
Ohi Omoijuanfo - ST - OVR 66
It was the return of the Norwegian league this weekend and with it we saw a hat trick from Stabaek's striker Ohi. He scored all three of their goals during a 3-1 win over Aalesund.
Reserves
Andrew Considine - CB -OVR 65
I always find it bizarre when this happens but we have a rare defender hat trick with Considine. The Aberdeen defender played in a CB three rather than his usual LB role and chipped in with three goals during their 7-0 romp of Dundee FC.
Andreas Ulmer - LB  -OVR 73
Although it was not quite a hat trick Ulmer came close to matching it with two goals and an assist to his name. Salzburg came away as 5-0 winners so with the clean sheet alongside his offensive stats it becomes increasingly difficult to see him not making the cut. The funny thing is that several defenders with multiple goals will likely miss out this week.
John Marquis - ST -OVR 63
Marquis has had an impressive season for Doncaster and another three this week sees him climb to the top of the goal scorer rankings. Several other hat tricks but with many including pens I think Marquis has a step up on them.
Jamie Maclaren  - ST -OVR 70
There were several A-League players which could have easily made the cut on any normal week but with so many players performing I have selected just the one which comes with Maclaren. The Australian striker scored three of Brisbane’s five goals in their 5-1 win.
Erick Torres - ST - OVR 71
Dynamo managed to produce an impressive 4-1 win over NYRB, a result which surprised most. Torres was the man pulling the strings managing to score three of their four goals."

With all the new events in FIFA Mobile, some of the players in the game from launch have pretty much been forgotten. Nowadays, the items everyone wants are TOTY ones, Icons or the latest promo offerings. However, not everyone is able to purchase or redeem those for their teams. When comparing base Gold rated players against higher base Elites, it's fair to ask: is it better to train a player from a low overall, or buy a higher overall player? 
Obviously, coins are required to train a player from a low overall to a higher overall. But it can sometimes less advantageous to upgrade a higher overall player that you have bought from the market than a lower overall one.
We start to see this by analysing three different lower tier players compared to a higher tier version of their position, being CB, CAM and ST. With each comparison, there will be a total coin cost and the total amount of XP to reach 100 overall for each player, as well as a comparison of the overall attributes.
The first comparison is between 87-overall TOTY Nominee CB Thiago Silva and Base Gold 79-overall Nacho Fernández. Silva goes for 1.7 million coins, while Nacho goes for between 100,000 and 200,000 coins. 

When both are upgraded to 100 overall, Nacho is less than 200 total stats behind Silva. Some may think that this a huge difference and Silva clearly outclasses Nacho. Nacho beats Silva in physical, defence and pace, though which are arguably the most important defensive stats that a CB needs.  Pace to catch up to attackers and physical to bump players and interrupt them, are crucial in VS Attack. 
Nacho will set you back 9.5 million in coins, while Silva will set you back 12.2 million (both including the purchase price). Adding to this nearly 3 million coin difference, Nacho also takes 2 million less XP to train up to 100 overall. That is a significant difference, seeing as both players are trained to the same overall. This (common amongst TOTY Nominees and Starters) shows that some of the higher rated cards might not live up to your expectations. Nacho will save you nearly 3 million coins and 2 million XP once fully upgraded, which is an insane saving, considering Nacho has the better crucial defending stats.
For a comparison in the midfield, consider 79-overall base gold Wayne Rooney with 85-base Elite Paulo Dybala. Rooney will set you back around 250,000 coins, while Dybala sells for closer to a million coins. 

When both maxed out though, 79 Rooney has an astounding 130 total stats higher than 85 Dybala. Rooney costs 9.5 million coins to train while Dybala costs around 9 million coins to both reach 100 overall. This is one example of the lower tier player costing more to train to 100 overall than the higher tier player. 
However, with the amount of stats Rooney has over Dybala, it is clear to see why he costs 500,000 coins more to train than Dybala, but this is offset by Rooney's 750,000 lower price tag. Dybala also takes 100,000 XP less to train than Rooney. So, it is worth spending the extra 100,000 XP on Rooney rather than saving with Dybala? For the difference in XP, Rooney would be the obvious choice as he beats Dybala in every single statistical category besides two.
Finally, comparing the best TOTY Nominee striker, and one of the better elite strikers in the game (prior to his untradeable Player of the Month item), with one of the most beloved cards in the community. The TOTY Nominee is 88-overall Sergio Aguero, which comes in at a price of 1.3 million coins, while the lower tier striker is base gold 74 overall, Amath Ndiaye Diedhiou, which sells for 35,000-50,000 coins.

When both maxed out at 100 overall, Ndiaye comes in with less than 140 stats lower than Aguero (yes even with Aguero's TOTY enhanced stats). Aguero costs 11.6 million coins to train to 100 overall, whilst Ndiaye only costs 9.6 million, including both of their purchase prices. That is an incredible 2 million coin difference in achieving the same overall on each player. 
On top of this, Ndiaye takes 1.8 million less XP to train up to 100 overall, an incredible difference considering both cards are being trained to the same overall. In terms of stats, Aguero obviously has most key attributes slightly higher than Nidiaye. However, Ndiaye does outclass Aguero in pace and strength, two extremely important stats. The more pace, the easier it is to get past players, and the more strength, the easier it is to push through defenders. With the minimal stat difference and the extreme price gap between upgrading the two players, you can't go wrong with choosing the likes of an Ndiaye over Aguero, saving 2 million coins and nearly 2 million XP. 

The promo/event cards do not always live up to the hype that surrounds them, and just because a base card has a higher overall, does not mean that the card is guaranteed to be better in the long run. To ensure you make smart decisions, always use the great player comparison tool and more on the Futhead Mobile player database to get the most out of your purchases. A little bit of research can save you millions of coins and stop you from making bad investments."

Professional FIFA player and six-time Gfinity Champion Spencer 'Unilad Gorilla' Ealing announced the 16-player list for the upcoming FIFA Ultimate Team series, 'Pro F8TAL,' via his Twitter account Monday, and this upcoming tournament might just be the best iteration so far.
The star-studded lineup features the likes of Corentin 'Vitality Rocky' Chevrey, the FIFA 17 Ultimate Team Championship winner, Hashtag United's Tassal 'Hashtag Tass' Rushan and Mike LaBelle, Schalke 04's Tim Latka, and Paris Saint-Germain's Agge Rosenmeier, among others.
The tourney has traditionally worked as such: Each episode on the competitor's YouTube channel includes two online single matches against opponents with full chemistry only. The starting team (on Episode 1) must have 10 Silver FUT players. At the end of each episode, the player offers his viewers a choice of two pairings to add to their team.
The matches are added together. For example, if the players wins Game 1 but loses Game 2, then the losses from Game 2 are deducted from the winnings in Game 1. Special items like SBC, POTY, or TOTS items are valued at 100K each, with each player only allowed as many as two.
Here's a list of all the participants:

                        Next up is Serie A and once again it looks rather overpowered!
                    

Formation: 4-4-2
Squad link: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/6065042/

Goalkeeper
Gianluigi Buffon - GK - OVR 88
When thinking of a Serie A TOTS Buffon is often a name which springs to mind and although he has probably not been the best this season his name alone should count for a lot. When called upon he has done what has been needed and has helped Juventus to the best defensive record in the division. The veteran has been included in four of the last 5 TOTS's and is widely renown for being one of the best keepers in the world.
Defenders
Alex Sandro - LB - OVR 84
For a few years, the one position which Serie A seriously struggled with in terms of FIFA was the LB. That is no longer the case thanks to Sandro who since making the move from Porto has gone from strength to strength. He has developed into one of the best LB's worldwide helping Juventus to yet another title. Offensively he has chipped in with 3 goals and two assists but it's his overall game which claims plaudits.
Kostas Manolas - CB - OVR 84
For many years Manolas has been that cheap overpowered CB which many have used but now the tables have turned and he has become one of the elite players. When he picks up his inevitable TOTS item he will instantly be one of the top five defenders on the game. He has been crucial in the defense of Roma who can boast the second best defensive record in the division conceding only 28 goals in the 33 that they have played.
Leonardo Bonucci - CB - OVR 87
Juventus's defensive has rotated a lot which for me has ruled out several options from them due to lack of games. Bonucci has featured more than most though with 24 games from a possible 34 to his name. There is a reason for this with the Italian developing into one of their main players. He has chipped in with three goals, one of which was quite special indeed. With him being a big name and part of a defense which has conceded just the 22 goals so far, I can see him getting the nod over other viable options.
Andrea Conti - RWB - OVR 71
Not the most attractive of players in terms of FUT but there is no doubt about his position in the side. He made my MC team selection and becomes the first player from the defensive side of things to make this draft as well. The Atalanta defender has excelled in his RWB position managing to score seven goals and assist another five which for a RWB is simply outstanding. 
Midfielders
Lorenzo Insigne - LW - OVR 00
Several Napoli players have had stand out seasons in the Italian league and Insigne is one of them. The winger has an impressive 20 goal contributions to his name with 14 goals and six assists. After picking up three upgrades from his original item on FUT its fair to say that Insigne will rate along the best LW's in the game.
Radja Nainggolan - CM - OVR 85
Nainggolan has not always been known for his offensive side of the game but with 10 goals to his name it is safe to say that he has added it to his game. He rates among the best midfielders in Gazzetta's ratings and with his offensive display this season there is no doubt about him being included this year.
Paulo Dybala - CAM - OVR 86
Dybala started his Juventus career very slowly when comparing him to his Palermo form but has since became one of their most important players of the season. You only have to look at the fact he has picked up 6 special items to realise the impact he’s had. The Argentine has primarily occupied a CAM role and from there has nine goals and six assists. 
Mohamed Salah - RM - OVR 82
There are so many players which failed to make the cut at Chelsea before moving abroad and turning into a top-class player. Salah is another example of that and with 13 goals and eight assists to his name this season its clear to see that he played a big part in Roma's season. 21 goal contributions in 30 games from midfield is something to admire.
Forwards
Dries Mertens - ST - OVR 85
Although losing your main striker through injury is never a good thing the fact Milik picked up a long-term injury may have helped Napoli discover something special. Since Mertens has made the move from the wing to a striker role he has not looked back, picking up 22 goals and 5 assists for Napoli helping them to 3rd place finish.
Gonzalo Higuain - ST - OVR 89
Higuain is largely recognised as one of the best strikers worldwide and in Serie A without a doubt but he has been outperformed by a few this season. Despite that he has still helped lead Juventus to yet another title after he picked up 23 goals for them. I wouldn't say that he has been one of the top two strikers but due to his rating alone he makes the starting side.
Substitutes
Gianluigi Donnarumma - GK - OVR 78
I think there is now very little doubt about how good Donnarumma is going to be. The young Italian keeper will be following in the footsteps of Buffon in terms of what he can achieve. Arguably the best keeper in terms of performances this season in Italy after producing numerous world class displays at only the age of 18.
Francesco Acerbi - CB - OVR 81
A player which I felt was a shoe in for MC was Acerbi but for one reason or another he didn't make the final cut. He has been a rock at the back for Sassuolo though and his consistency has helped them significantly. Not only has he done well defensively but also offensively, chipping in with four of his own for the side. 
Federico Bernardeschi - LM - OVR 80
In terms of being snubbed for TOTW there are not many better than Bernardeschi. He did eventually make the cut but only after being ignored on at least four occasions and was also wrongfully predicted numerous times by myself. He does deserve a spot in TOTS also after scoring 10 and assisting another two for Fiorentina in their below par season in comparison to past years.
Marek Hamsik - CM - OVR 85
Hamsik has been one of my favourite players on FIFA for several years now but this is by far the best item he will have gained. A club 80 Hamsik could be reality come the turn of Serie A and with 11 goals and four assists to his name it becomes hard to ignore him. Three IF's to his name have helped boost his stats and the likely TOTS will give him those few final stats to allow him access to the elusive 80 squad.
Jose Callejon - RW - OVR 82
Surprisingly Callejon is yet to pick up any special item this year but with both 10 goals and 10 assists to his name that could well be about to change when Serie A TOTS in announced. The Spaniard has played his part in a lethal top three for Napoli alongside both Insigne and Mertens who both also feature in the side. With a combined total of 46 goals between the three it's no wonder that they are challenging at the top of the table.
Edin Dzeko- ST - OVR 81
Described by Buffon as the best striker on current form towards the beginning of the season Dzeko has gone on to score 25 goals for Roma this season making him tied at the top alongside Belotti. Roma currently sit in second position and with Dzeko up top it's easy to see why. 
Andrea Belotti - ST - OVR 80
Without a doubt the break through player this season has been Belotti. Th young Italian has impressed week after week with his performances and with him being the league’s top goal scorer with 25 goals in 29 games for a mid-table side is simply absurd. He will be signed in the summer with multiple sides inevitably chasing his signature.
Reserves
Wojciech Szczesny - GK - OVR 81
It was another top season for the Polish keeper who helped Roma to their previously mentioned defensive record of only conceding 28 goals in the 33 games they have played. It's been an impressive season for the Arsenal loanee and should they require him I am sure he will do a job in the BPL once Cech has retired.
Mattia Caldara - CB - OVR 74
Conti was not the only defender chipping in with goals for Atalanta with Caldara doing the same for them as well. The young Italian also found the net on seven occasions and with seven goals for a CB standing out I believe he will be getting the nod over his central pairing in Masiello who has arguably been the better player of the two.
Alejandro Gomez - CAM - OVR 81
Another player who has impressed since making the move from winger to central position is Gomez. The Atalanta player has now picked up 14 goals and eight assists. There could be some debate over his actual position but seeing as though he has played the second half of the season in the central role that is what I am opting for.
Miralem Pjanic - CM - OVR 85
For me this was the weakest spot with several fringe players in contention and because of that I feel as though the big name will get the nod. Pjanic has not been as prolific as previous season but with five goals and six assists to his name he hasn't been quiet either. Should Pjanic be snubbed I feel as though the following are the best options: Perisic, Kessie, Bonaventura, Koulibaly or Suso.
Mauro Icardi - ST - OVR 84
The caliber of strikers this season in Italy has been unusually high with several hitting the 20+ mark. Icardi is another who falls in that category after finding the net on 24 occasions. Inter are starting to recover to the side they once were but they still have a long way to go yet.
Extra (SBC)
Ciro Immobile - ST - OVR 81
Continuing the theme of a 24th player for an SBC I am once again opting for a forward. As stated previously the Italian league has seen so many strikers perform this season and Immobile is another who broke the 20-goal mark. With four IF's to his name he becomes hard to ignore but at the same time there are so many other ST's ahead of him which makes this spot perfect for him."

Last week's score: 17/23
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad Link: http://www.futhead.com/18/squads/2838585/

Goalkeeper
Ivan Cuellar - GK - OVR 75
Both goalkeeper and La Liga options were slim pickings this week and thus when Cuellar was awarded with three stars from MARCA for his performance in a 0-0 draw, he became the best option. Although he only made the one save, he also produced a brilliant last man tackle which really stood out.
Defenders
Jardel - CB - OVR 80
Despite conceding in Benfica's 5-1 home win over Rio Ave, I would still be surprised to see Jardel excluded from the side on Wednesday. The Brazilian defender scored one and assisted another, picking up MOTM in the process and helping to maintain the gap at the top to just two points.
Mats Hummels - CB - OVR 88
Some may say that a SIF for Hummels without an offensive contribution is cheap, but as a defender, it's not your job to score goals but instead help keep the clean sheet. Hummels was brilliant for Munich this weekend helping to ensure Mainz failed to score and was rewarded with the joint highest rating from Kicker this week. With a lack of Bundesliga options, it makes Hummels an attractive one to go for.
Alex Telles - LB - OVR 80
Alex Telles has always impressed from defense, both in Turkey and in Portugal, but there’s not many performances which can rate with his most recent. Porto ended up winning the match 3-1 but with Telles providing the assist on all three of those goals, without him it could well have been a much different story.
Midfielders
Henrikh Mkhitaryan - LM - OVR 85
The first of two Arsenal players selected for their 5-1 win over Everton comes in the form of both a new signing and a OTW item. Mkhitaryan had always shown a creative side to him while at United, but with a lack of game time provided resulted in him being unable to show his best. Early signs from Arsenal suggest he could get that opportunities and with three assists to his name this week, he has made his case for it
Aaron Ramsey - CDM - OVR 82
For me, both Arsenal players should make the cut from their 5-1 win against Everton. But should it be the case that only one makes it, that just has to be Ramsey. The Welshman has impressed in stages over the past few years and looked at the top of his game on Saturday, scoring three goals from CDM. 
Sami Khedira - CM - OVR 84
The first of two Juventus players I have selected, which does mean that Alex Sandro narrowly misses out, is Khedira. The German was the official MOTM despite there also being a hat trick. With two goals and an assist from midfield in a 7-0 win, he has every right to that claim. He could miss out, but with him being Italy's POTW, I couldn't ignore him.
Florian Thauvin - RM - OVR 82
I have incorrectly predicted a SIF Thauvin on a couple of occasions. However, there is no questioning his spot this time around. The Frenchman was involved in four Marseille goals in their 6-3 thriller with Metz, scoring three himself alongside assisting another.
Mohamed Salah - RW - OVR 83
Completing a OTW and PL orientated midfield, we have a familiar face in Salah. The Egyptian has lit up the Premier League this season and continues to perform week in-week out. Another two goals to his name this week saw Liverpool pick up a point against Tottenham.
Forwards
Gonzalo Higuain - ST - OVR 90
Despite the fact the match was already over when Higuain showed up, the matter of the fact is that the Argentine scored three goals and realistically that means he will be included. Juventus ended the match as 7-0 victors and there could well be more than just Higuain making the cut.
Michy Batshuayi - ST - OVR 80
Yet another OTW to make the side. Batshuayi was unlucky at Chelsea due to lack of game time, which is often the case with them as a club, but even when he did play he was among the goal scorers. Now with the departure of PEA, he looks set to become the main man at Dortmund. He excelled on his debut, scoring twice and assisting another in a narrow 3-2 win over Koln. Already worth the transfer.
Substitutes
Beto - GK - OVR 76
A late addition to the side and one which comes at great relief for myself. The keepers were beyond scarce this week and thus nine saves on a Monday night to keep a clean sheet is more than enough for me to select Beto to pick up his SIF of the season.
Nathan Ake - CB - OVR 75
There were a couple of surprising midweek results in the premiership, one of which was Bournemouth's 3-0 win over Chelsea. Wilson excelled again scoring one and assisting another but due to the proximity of recent IFs I believe that will rule him out. The other option is Ake, who scored and helped keep their clean sheet, of which I feel is enough.
Damien Da Silva - CB - OVR 77
With so many defenders performing to a high standard this week, Da Silva was nearly excluded from side. But with two goals to his name, it was difficult to ignore him, especially when you consider that those goals were pivotal with Caen ending up as 3-2 winner.
Fabian Orellana - RM - OVR 80
Several options from Eibar, particularly in defense with three defenders contributing offensively, two of which proving two offensive contributions. But it's midfield I am going for with Orellana, who scored twice in their 5-1 win.
Illarramendi - CM - OVR 81
The midfield was not short of options this week, which will result in one or two players missing out who would usually breeze into the side. I do think Sociedad's Illarramendi will scrape into the side though, after he scored two of their five goals, picking up MOTM in the process.
Theo Walcott - RM - OVR 80
Although Walcott and his new side Everton were thrashed by his old side Arsenal this weekend, Walcott is still very likely to make the cut due to his midweek performance. The winger scored both Everton goals as they picked up a 2-1 home win over Leicester. A good start to his Everton career and to those early OTW owners.
Luuk De Jong - ST - OVR 76
We end the substitutes with an easy selection courtesy of Luuk De Jong. The PSV striker was involved in three of their four goals in a 4-0 win at home to Zwolle. All three of his contributions came in the form of goals which resulted in him picking up player of the week in the Eredivisie.
Reserves
Raphael Wolf - GK - OVR 66
It's not often that we see a goalkeeper pick up the perfect Kicker rating of 1, but that is exactly what Wolf managed in Dussledorf's 1-0 home win. The keeper made a total of five saves, one of which was a penalty, which saw him claim player of the week.
Michele Rizzi - CAM - OVR 67
Words can't quite do this performance justice; Rizzi came off the bench at half time to see his side fall two goals behind with things looking bleak for the away side. He then managed to find the net four times from midfield to turn the game around and eventually win 4-2. Yes, four goals in 45 minutes from midfield. That did happen.
Lautaro Martinez - ST - OVR 72
Football Manager players will recognise this name -- and it turns out he’s decent in real life. The young Argentine scored a hat trick for Racing club as they raced away with a 4-0 win.
Francesco Caputo - ST - OVR 71
Empoli's unbeaten run was largely down to their defensive display picking up draw after draw, but recently they have added goals to their game. Now with three wins on the bounce, and back-to-back 4-0 wins, they look a force in the Italian second division. Caputo scored three of four in their latest win and thus makes this side.
Henry Martin - ST - OVR 69
The Oribe Peralta Club America-era seems to be coming to an end now. Martin was the player given the chance to shine this week, and he well and truly delivered, scoring three of their five goals in a 5-1 home win."

                        Welcome to my weekly Ones to Watch update and analysis! I’ve combed through the schedules of all the players with OTW items and organized their game times and likelihood of starting into a handy spreadsheet.  
                    

OTW Weekend is brought to you by @GummiFifa!
It is fair to say that Ones to Watch items have been a major hit in FIFA 17. In particular, the trading and investing community has taken to these cards because of the relative ease at which you can earn coins by trading with them. We have seen many investors earn millions off of well-timed OTW trades!
I’ve prepared OTW list for the weekend of 1-3th April and all the midweek games to help you trade this and next week. Keep in mind, although some players are likely to start, I can obviously not guarantee that they will start. Predictions are taken from Whoscored.com

How to Trade with OTW Players
So, now that I’ve peaked your curiosity, I’m sure you are wondering how exactly to trade with OTW cards. There are two main methods that have proven to work every single week.
This first method is to take advantage of bad performances. When a player performs badly (a main indicator is the team losing or the player earning a poor whoscored match rating) his price tends to drop after the game, presumably because many investors and casual players panic sell the card. This provides an opportune window to pick the card up for cheap. Then, throughout the week, his price will slowly rise until game day. While it may be tempting to hold the player until he earns an inform, remembering the pattern from last week, we will want to sell the player on before the next game actually starts (a good time to sell is usually when he is announced in the starting lineup). The reason why we do that is because if he doesn’t perform well in the first 30-45 minutes his price will start to drop as it did the week prior. This is called selling in the hype.
The second method is more profitable but requires more attention. What you have to do is either watch the game that the OTW is playing or you have notifications turned on, on your phone or computer, that notify you straight away when there is a goal. If a OTW player scores in the game his price will skyrocket. However, picking up the player is not easy and you have to be quick. The time frame to pick up a player when he scores is constantly becoming smaller. At this stage in the game, you have around 20 seconds to pick up the player before your room for profit is gone. After these 20 seconds, his price will have already inflated and he won’t be worth picking up.
Trading with OTW players has never been as popular as it is now. This is not only going to make you profit, but it is also entertaining! The key is selling into the hype and not getting caught holding a card too long because of greed. Slow, steady profits will win the race in the long run.
Best of luck,
GummiFIFA"

Unveiling three of the biggest names to feature in the FIFA 18 Ultimate Team Ones to Watch: Winter Edition Sunday may have taken a little wind out of the sails for today, 2 February's big promo, but you have to admit: the higher rated black dynamic in-form items sure look appealing.
The previously unveiled Barcelona (sorry, Liverpool fans)'s Philippe Coutinho, Manchester United's Alexis Sanchez, and Arsenal's Henrikh Mkhitaryan didn't leave much to the imagination -- except, we suppose, what position their automatically-updating-each-time-they-get-a-new-non-TOTS-special-item would be. But now we officially know they're joined by the Gunners' other big signing, Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang as well as the likes of Spurs' Lucas Moura and Manchester City's Aymeric Laporte.
The lower-rated new Winter Ones to Watch, the ones we'll see in highest supply and most obtainably price-wise, are intriguing, though lack the fireworks of even the Fall release in some senses. There was no surprise Ousmane Dembele, who failed to feature after being injured shortly into his FC Barcelona career. And while many players would've flipped at one point for a FUT meta-king Ahmed Musa potential special item, back at CKSA Moscow, his appeal becomes rather niche to say the least.

                        Bayern Munich didn't have it quite as easy this season yet still have seven players featuring in the side.
                    

Formation: 4-4-2
Squad Link:http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/6083990/

Goalkeeper
Manuel Neuer - GK - OVR 92
Neuer was snubbed from TOTS last year but after winning TOTY once again and widely being recognised as the best keeper in the world can you really leave him out? It's not like he has had a bad season either with just 17 goals being conceded he has been there when called upon. His defensive does a lot of the work but can that really go against him?
Defenders
Sead Kolasinac - LB - OVR 77
Once again Alaba misses out on the cut which should I be correct will be the third consecutive year that he has been snubbed. Kolasinac has by far been the most impressive LB of the season with his constant displays being a bright light during Schalke's bang average season. He has contributed offensively with three goals and five assists which will help him stand out.
Matts Hummels - CB - OVR 87
Like many of Dortmund's top players Hummels made the move over to their rivals Munich. Some flop while others excel and Hummels falls into the latter section for sure. The German defender has continued to develop and has been at the heart of Munich's defensive helping them to their previously mentioned superb defensive record.
Javi Martinez - CB - OVR 85
With Boateng being injured it was Martinez who was given the incredibly difficult shoes to fill and the Spaniard exceeded expectations in many senses. Yes, the Munich defense is strong regardless who of they played but Martinez played his part in that. Arguably the weakest selection in terms of defenders so if EA feel that it is too Munich based he will be the man to miss out but he deserves a spot in the side.
Phillpp Lahm - RB - OVR 89
Despite Lahm set to retire at the end of the season there is no doubt about him still being one of the best RB in the world. The German defender has shone once again at the age of 33 returning to his RB duties after a couple of seasons in the CDM role for Munich. You could argue his position in the side but with him being the leading defender on Kicker I find him hard to overlook.
Midfielders
Emil Forsberg - LM - OVR 79
Forsberg played a vital role in Leipzig’s promotion last season where he was arguably the best player in the division. He has continued to improve and has really stepped up to the next level continuing to impress while in the top division. The Swede has an impressive 8 goals and 15 assists to his name which will be more than enough to secure his spot.
Naby Keita - CM - OVR 78
Continuing the theme of Leipzig, we have another midfielder who has shone for them in Keita. At just 21 years of age Keita has a huge future ahead of him and could even reach the heights of African player of the year eventually. He has picked up four Ifs’ over the course of this FIFA which will result in his inevitable TOTS being very usable. 
Thiago - CM - OVR 85
There has always been hype around Thiago but this is the first season that he has truly shown what he is capable of. The Spanish midfielder only has five goals and 5 assists to his name on paper but he has played a vital part for Munich this season and has developed into one of their main players. 
Arjen Robben - RM - OVR 87
Robben leads the Kicker rating this year and after missing out on TOTS during FIFA 16 he is well and truly back. He has been alongside the best performers in the Bundesliga this season and with 11 goals and seven assists to his name it’s easy to see why. Despite it being well known that he has a deadly left foot players just can't stop him. 
Forwards
Robert Lewandowski - ST - OVR 90 
When asked to associate the Bundesliga with a player Lewandowski will be bought up regularly and there’s a reason for that. The Polish striker had yet another prolific season finding the back of the net on 28 occasions which is as many starts as he had. He continues to establish himself as one of the very best but with the talent on offer in current times it is unlikely that he will ever hit the heights of TOTY.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang- ST - OVR 87
The other striker is another which you won't be surprised to hear in Aubameyang. The Dortmund finisher falls just behind Lewandowski in terms of goals with 27 to his name but once again has torn up the Bundesliga with his pace and strength. Surely its only a matter of time before the very best start enquiring about PEA.
Substitutes
Rune Almenning Jarstein - GK - OVR 80
Jarstein has been the most impressive keeper this season helping Hertha to a more than respectable 5th in the table alongside holding the 5th best defensive record. Jarstein has played a large part of that consistently performing well which has made him the highest rated keeper on Kicker. A very easy inclusion to make.
Will Orban - CB - OVR 77
It's not only the offensive side of Leipzig which has impressed with their defensive side of the game also playing a big part in their success. Orban has been the player to stand out and is once again a player with a great future ahead. At still only 23 years of age I am sure that he will be attracting some attention over the summer
Ousmane Dembele - RM - OVR 00
At just 19 years of age with the hype surrounding Dembele it was always going to be a question of whether he could deal with the pressure or not. It's safe to say that he succeeded though managing six goals and eleven assists for Dortmund this season which has seen him develop into one of the best wingers in the league already.
Sebastian Rudy - CM - OVR 78
Rudy has picked up two goals, seven assists and a transfer to Bayern Munich in the summer because of his performances this campaign. The German midfielder has really developed this season and although I'm not entirely sure how he will fit into the Bayern side his performances have deserved the big summer signing status.
Vicenzo Grifo - LM - OVR 75
Grifo was the star alongside Forsberg in the second division of Germany and although no quite to the extent that Forsberg has managed he has continued to impress when making the move to the higher division. The Italian has six goals and seven assists to his name which for a newly promoted side is quite impressive 
Timo Werner - ST - OVR 77
Back to the offensive side of Leipzig’s game now with Werner who like many of Leipzegs squad is another young German talent. The 20-year-old has scored an impressive 17 goals which puts him 4th overall in the league and has another five assists alongside that. His pace up top causes teams a lot of problems and he seems to have the finishing to go alongside that.
Anthony Modeste - ST - OVR 82
Outside of the obvious names Modeste has been the best striker in the division by quite some distance. The Frenchman has 23 goals to his name which for a side with just 43 goals in total shows just how important he is to the side. He is currently third in the top goal scorer race narrowly behind both PEA and Lewan.
Reserves
Lukasz Piszczek - RB - OVR 82
A significant reason that Piszczek has made the cut for me is the number of goals he has scored. Five in total making him one of the highest scoring defenders in the division alongside the fact Dortmund are flying high with only a few realistic options of making the cut should all work in favour for the Polish RB.
Niklas Sule - CB - OVR 81
Either one of Hoffenheim CB's could make the cut with both Sule and Hubner having superb seasons however Sule is largely regarded as the better of the two from Bundesliga watchers and although that could be hype based due to what is expected of the young defender he has shown that he is capable of big things. There’s no doubt about his potential and that he shall be one to watch in the coming years.
Karem Demirbay - CM - OVR 76
Another Hoffenheim player now and another young German it is. There seems to be a never-ending supply of talented Germans which explains why they are doing so well at the international level. Much like his central midfield partner Rudy, Demirbay has chipped in with a fair amount of goal contributions from the middle of the park. 6 goals and 7 assists on paper and that should be enough to see him in alongside his kicker rating.
Max Kruse - ST - OVR 80
There are a few players this spot could go to with both Ibsevic, Wagner, Gomez and Stindl all narrowly missing out. In the end, I opted for Max Kruse who has recorded 14 goals for Bremen and is rated second just behind Lewandowski but ahead of PEA in the Kicker ratings which is always a good indicator for these sides.
Andrej Kramaric - ST - OVR 77
Other than the obvious suggestion of Leipzig, Hoffenheim have been one of the stand out sides this season currently sitting high up in fourth position. It has largely been a team display hence the selection of players in this side but Kramaric has been involved in 21 of their 59 goals showing his importance to the side. Although he is not one of the highest scoring players in the division his assist total should help him make the cut over those with just a few more.
Extra (SBC)
Serge Gnabry - LM - OVR 77
Gnabry has played all over the park this season but with the clear majority of his games coming from the LM position I believe that if he does make the cut he will be placed there rather than the ST position which could also be selected. The ex-Arsenal winger scored an impressive 11 goals on his debut season for Werder Bremen making him their second highest goal scorer."

                        In terms of gameplay skills, I am not an exceptional FIFA player. I freely admit that I am, at best, slightly above average. This is especially true for my finishing ability, which my roommate claims is, “literally the worst he’s ever seen.”
                    

Right about now, you’re probably thinking that this is a rather odd way of establishing ethos if I’m meant to be writing a post about how to do well in the Weekend League. Ironically, it is precisely my lack of skill that makes me qualified to write this post. To compensate for what is often a lack of skill, I’ve learned to adopt a number of tactics that help me grind out wins in Weekend League. In fact, the other week when I was on Spring Break/Holiday and finally found the time to complete all 40 games (my first time doing so since November), I managed to finish 1 game off of Elite 2. 

In this post, we’ll be covering a number of things that I’ve learned to that help me make up for my lack of skill, including; how to control your emotions and win the mental game, maintaining concentration,  and how to hold leads (yes, for better or worse that includes time wasting tactics). 
Control Your Emotions
If there is one piece of advice that I could pass on, it’s that one’s ability to control their emotions while playing FIFA is incredibly important. 
Adrenaline is Your Enemy
When we get angry, an experience all too familiar to the average weekend league warrior, the main hormone responsible for how we feel is adrenaline. Adrenaline is usually useful because it helps us make quick decisions, but that does not necessarily mean it will be the right decision. In addition, while adrenaline gives a significant boost to our gross motor skills (the ones that involve large muscle groups and are responsible for major body movements such as running, charging, etc.), the efficiency of our fine motor skills (responsible for the fine movements required for handling a controller) take a heavy hit. In summary, adrenaline causes FIFA players to quickly make poor decisions that are likely executed incorrectly. Doesn’t exactly sound like a recipe for success. So, let’s talk about a couple ways to control adrenaline…

Pause after conceding: After you concede, especially if the goal was bullshit, pause the game and let the full 30 seconds timeout. During this time, do whatever you have to do to collect yourself. You need to physically calm your body down and allow it to come off the adrenaline induced high. I usually take a couple of deep breaths, but I’ve been told that drinking water is particularly helpful. 
Don’t yell: Verbally shouting has been linked with increased adrenaline levels.
Take breaks in-between matches: After a game, especially one that didn’t go your way, take a sizable break. For me, I usually go and trade/monitor the market for ~5 minutes before going back into a game. 
Listen to music: The cheers and chants of the crowd are designed to raise excitement levels. This excitement, a.k.a. adrenaline, can be avoided by playing with the sound off, or by listening to music. 
Laugh at the game: This is a tough one, but it’s helped me tremendously. If something happens in the game that pisses you off, try and see it a funny light. Did Butland just let the ball roll through his legs? Try and see that as something goofy or funny. Even if you have to fake it, studies have shown that even forced smiles and fake laughter improve mood and reduce anxiety/stress levels. 

Keeping Perspective
There is bullshit in this game. Any game with this much AI control combined with highly variable user input it going to have it. At times, it can feel like the game is against us. When the odds seem stacked against you, it can be easy to get frustrated. To help cope, I like to keep track of all the times I’ve been lucky. That way, when something goes against me, I can better remember that statistically, over a large enough sample of games (40 for example), the bullshit will even itself out between you and your opponents.
Keeping Concentration
Staying focused for 40 games is difficult. However, in terms of earning successful records, it’s importance is criminally underrated. So, let’s talk about ways to improve/maintain it…
Get Enough Sleep
This is probably the most important piece of advice I can offer here. As an incentive to get good sleep, let’s rattle off a number of the negative effects of drowsiness…

Reduced reaction time: Studies have shown that drowsiness (which, in this study, was defined by less that four hours of sleep) reduced reaction time by 7%. 
Impaired problem solving/creativity: One of the first things to go when we get tired is our ability to quickly process and creatively solve complex problems. And if you think about it, that’s what FIFA is, a complex problem that you are competing against an opponent to solve.
The big hit here is the lack of creativity. Stale, repetitive gameplay is very easy to defend. 


Increased emotional volatility: When we are low on sleep, it’s hard to control our emotions. Like we’ve already covered, controlling our emotions is vital. 

Take 24 Minute Naps
If you find that you are drowsy but are falling behind on your game schedule, take a 24 minute nap. It’s been proven that this is the optimal short nap length. In fact, NASA astronauts take daily 24 minute naps because of it. 
To be clear, this is 24 minutes of time asleep. You’ll need to adjust your alarm according to how long it takes to fall asleep on average. 
Play Actively
This is going to be tough to explain, but it’s important so I’ll do my best. Just like you can read text without actually reading/comprehending it, you can play FIFA in cruise control. Don’t let yourself coast in a competitive game of FIFA, you won’t like the results. To help avoid this, you can do a number of things; 

Constantly think 1-2 passes ahead.
Look for open players on the minimap
Notice what players your opponent has selected on defense by how they are moving and try to avoid/confuse that selected player
Actively think about varying your gameplay style/build-up play in order to keep your opponent on their toes, etc. 

Space Out Your Games
This is incredibly important. I would never recommend playing more than 10 games in a session. As you play more games in a row, just like in any mentally strenuous activity, your brain fatigues. The first aspect that you’ll lose in your gameplay will be your offensive creativity. This will make your attacks predictable and easy to defend against. 
Hydrate/Eat/Exercise
This is another big one. You don’t want any ounce of brainpower, even if it’s being devoted to a primal instinct, worried about anything other than the game you are trying to win.
* As a side note, as FIFA gets more competitive, you’ll notice that many of the pro players treat their bodies as if they were traditional athletes. This is because they recognize the positive effects it can have on their gameplay. 
Avoid Distraction
This is obvious, but try and reduce outside distractions. That includes twitch streams, youtube, Netflix, etc. Even just having a roommate talking to you takes your mind off the game. And as I’m sure we all know, a momentary lapse in concentration can be costly, especially when you are playing top level players. 
If you are playing in an environment that is always going to provide distractions, I find that listening to methodical, instrumental based music (limited lyrics) helps me focus. If you want to get really intense, you could even just play white noise in a pair of headphones, but that seems rather dramatic if you ask me. 
Holding Leads
Let’s talk about holding leads. If you find yourself in the fortunate position of being in the lead towards the end of the game, your opponent is going to do everything they can to get back into the game. Let’s go over some tactics you can use to see the game out… 
Don’t Go Into a Shell
The biggest tip that I can offer is that you don’t want to totally give up on your style of play. After all, unless you’ve paid off the FIFA gods, your play style is likely what earned you the lead in the first place. Just like real life, there is only so much pressure that a clearance into row zed can alleviate. We are just going to tweak a couple of things to make it more difficult to score on us.
Adjust Your Lineup/Tactics
Right after you score a late go ahead goal or when you are nearing the end of the game while holding a lead (I usually wait until the 70-75th minute to make these changes) pause the game. Once you’ve done so, it’s time to make some changes. Here are the changes I recommend;

Clog the Midfield: Switch to a formation that clogs the midfield. Personally, I prefer to switch to a 41212(2). Once you’ve done this, adjust the player instructions so that your CDMs and CMs are set to stay back while attacking (do the same for your left and right backs if you don’t normally play them as such).
Custom Tactics: Switch yourself over to counter attack. This combo will help you keep a compact midfield to snuff out attacks, while keeping your opponent honest with your three attacking players on the brake (CAM and two strikers). 
Tactical subs: In my opinion, bringing on defensive subs is overlooked by the competitive community. I highly recommend keeping two defensive minded midfielders as substitutes that can act as fresh ball winners. They should be replacing your attacking minded midfielders (or a winger depending on your formation). 
Defensive Substitutes: Keep in mind that the advantage that these subs bring is speed and stamina that your opponent’s players won’t have at the end of the game. Accordingly, players like Kante and Renato Sanches are good looks. 
Offensive Substitutes: This should be someone with speed and strength that can hold the ball up with shielding and keep your opponent honest on the attack. Martial comes to mind as a good option. 
Switch to Defensive: In my opinion, switching to ultra defensive or park the bus while your opponent is on ultra attacking or all out attack is begging for them to score a long shot. You get too compressed in the box on these settings and one missed tackle can lead to a wide open look for a long shot. Don’t reinvent the wheel at the end of the game, just be a bit more cautious.

Track Back with your attackers
In the beginning of the game, you should be cautious about defending with your attacking players. Having them track back constantly can burn their stamina and put them out of position for counter attacks. However, at the end of the game, your only worry is not conceding. If you lose the ball and the option is there, try tracking back with your speedy strikers, especially if you’ve just brought them on as a sub. You’ll be surprised at how proficient some attackers are at defending, especially ones with good height, strength, and speed. 
Time Wasting Tactics
This is going to be a bit of a touchy subject. It is extremely frustrating when someone effectively timewasters against you. Therefore, before we get into this, I ask that you use these tactics sparingly. For example, if you are winning 3-0 in the 85th minute, in my opinion, timewasting is a bit scummy, you just don’t need to do. It’s important to win and lose with grace, even if it’s just a video game. But I’m guessing you all don’t care what I think, so let’s just go over some ways to burn the clock;

Slide Tackle: If you manage to get to the end of the game with the majority of your players booking free, it may be worth trying to stop promising looking attacks with slide tackles that you would otherwise not attempt for fear of racking up cards. Not only does this stop an attack, but it also leads to a free kick. And as I’m sure you are all aware, for some reason, offensive free kicks often lead to counter attacks when the opponent is pressing.
Avoid the Keeper’s Hands: One of the quickest ways to launch a counter attack is by having your keeper distribute to a winger with a long throw. For this reason, on corner kicks and with crosses towards the end of the game, aim for the near post and far post to try and avoid letting the keeper catch it cleanly. 
Be Aware of Field Position: The most obvious way to limit your opponent's chance of making a comeback is to limit their possession. The most common tactic is to pass the ball around the back, but in my opinion, the risk of gifting your opponent a goal is too high. Instead aim to keep hold of the ball in the final third, on the wings. However, unlike in real life, don’t trap yourself in the corner. It can be difficult to work your way out of there and often times your right and left backs push up too far to help, making you susceptible to counter attacks. Instead, there is a happy medium in between the halfway line and the end line on the corner of the 18 where holding the ball is quite easy once you get used to your formation. 
Set Pieces: Set pieces are a great way to drain the clock. The first step (please use this sparingly) is to milk the amount of time you have before putting the ball back into play. Let’s break down how to take different free kicks
In Own Half: Take it short and quickly distribute to your backs or wingers. Don’t dribble. 
Middle Third: Change the free kick view, manually select a winger, and move them into a position where they can receive the free kick uncontested. Aim for the corners.
Final Third: Take it short and learn to not lose the ball. You must be able to hold it at least until your team can resume it’s normal defensive shape. If you can’t do this, kick the ball out of bounds. Yes, seriously, you are better off defending a deep throw-in/goal kick than a counter attack from a failed free kick. 
Corner Kick: Learn to take them short and hold the ball. 



More to come?
This post is already getting too long, so I’m going to stop it here. Hopefully these tips help you enjoy weekend league a bit more. There is still more that I could cover including but not limited to; how to counter common tactics and playstyles, coming from behind, how to play against players who are more skilled than you, and other miscellaneous tips. If this post goes over well, and this is something that you’d be interested in, I can get working on another post where I cover those. Let me know!

The dawn of a new FIFA is approaching. FIFA 17 is beginning to die out like a toddler's electronic stuffed animal from three Christmas's ago. Hope springs eternal. FIFA 18 could be the best edition of the franchise yet. All of the past ills and bugs will be fixed and Ultimate Team will be the catalyst that brings it to the promised land. Surely.
In all seriousness, FUT is without a doubt EA's cornerstone for FIFA. It's their bread and butter. Every year the mode gains more and more momentum without any signs of waning interest from us the public, holding our fists of cash out willingly. Thus, it's safe to presume that EA has invested a lot of time and effort into making improvements and additions to their showcase mode. 
We're currently well past the window of EA adding new features into FIFA 18. At this time we're just waiting for the grand unveiling for new things coming to FUT. However, until that occurs, we're free to dream about what could be coming. Here are five things I'd love to see added to propel FUT to even further greatness: 
Co-op FUT clubs
When FUT isn't consuming my life, Co-op Seasons is my game mode of choice. The dynamic of team play without the hectic nature of Pro Clubs, co-op is a great mix of fun with friends and competitiveness. Considering the mode's sustainability through the past several years, it must be pretty popular. An idea emerged one night during a co-op session with a long-time friend: ""How cool would it be if we could do this with FUT?"" 
One of the goals of any publisher, when they release a game into the world, is to get their consumers talking about their product. Nothing fuels that discussion like team-oriented modes that get friends to communicate and spread the word. Incorporating that into FIFA's most popular mode seems like common sense. 
Also, having the ability to have separate FUT clubs -- a personal club and several co-op clubs with  friends -- would add variety and keep the mode fresh throughout the year. Co-op seasons and tournaments would be another nice addition, so it keeps competition fair. 
One concern could be database space. Adding hundreds of thousands of new clubs to store data on could be problematic. One possible solution could be to limit club creation to a few per user. Logistics aren't exactly known for this, but it would be a swell addition to the game and a fun one to play with friends. 
Retro items
FIFA 17's FUT Birthday release was close to being an answer to a lot of user's dreams of getting retro items in the game. Playing with Fernando Torres or Samuel Eto'o in their primes was something a lot of people had been asking for. In FIFA 18 it would be cool to see them take that idea one step further. Licensing prevents the players from being switched back to their original clubs (Torres to Liverpool, Eto'o to Barcelona, etc.), but they could perhaps change their appearance to more resemble what they looked like in their primes. They changed Pele's appearance, surely they could at least modify some of the item photos.
Nostalgia is a strong motivator for people to spend money. I can guarantee that there would be thousands of Liverpool fans out there hoping to pack a Throwback Torres to get him in their dream team and so on. FUT Birthday seemed like a half-measure to fulfilling this dream.
Get rid of attribute cards
Does this need much of an explanation? Get rid of them. They're literally anti-competitive FIFA and it sucks when your opponent doesn't honor the same unwritten rules you do.
""But they need them to fill out gold packs.""
Find something else. Increase the number of FUT Draft tokens. Anything else.
Higher FUT Draft stakes
Speaking of FUT Draft, something needs to be done. The mode is quickly falling off. FUT 16 it was all the rage. Content creators and regular Joe's alike were doing all they could to get the World Record FUT Draft score. Fast forward to current times and literally no one is talking about it and if they are it's about how much of a joke the rewards are. 
The obvious answer to this is to increase the rewards for someone who wins or advances a long way. Unfortunately, that would likely shift the market too much, especially early in the game's cycle. So, what can you do to make the premium rewards for winning mean more? Increase the entry fee to something riskier. Treat it more like a gamble than just a fun mode, because the fun part has quickly faded. Make the entry fee something high like 50,000 coins and guarantee the winner at least a 50k pack and possibly more. This would make the mode feel more competitive with a bigger reward for the ultimate victor at the end. 
New version of SBCs/collection albums
Again, in FIFA 17 we got something similar to the collection album that a lot of users have been begging for in the form of league SBCs. The problem with SBCs is that users with a lot of coins could buy players and complete them in a matter of minutes. Where's the fun in that? 
Keep the same idea as league SBCs with the reward of a special item at the end, but instead, make only first-owner items eligible. Make sure the reward item is a special new item type and worth the effort. This incentivizes opening packs. If you wanted to go a step further, make the rewards for every club completed. 
Many of the users out there claim to be ""collectors"" when hoarding items they've packed. Reward them for their efforts of opening packs and hanging on to items. 
These are just a few ideas for the next installment of FUT. Give your thoughts on these ideas and then let us know what your wish list would include."

If you need a break from the Ultimate TOTS drama of Friday but still want a fun distraction to keep you plugged in on FIFA Mobile, the new FM Summer Celebration (formerly informally known as ""You Make The Call"") might do just the trick.
Showcasing new Bonfire Live Events and other league-focused ones (Belgium's Pro League, the Dutch Eredivisie, and Turkey's Super Lïg amongst them), these new items/plans seem perfectly targeted at fans of a couple of the leagues that didn't get the same treatment on FIFA Mobile that they did during TOTS on console.
As voted by FM enthusiasts and fans on Twitter, a few names more familiar to TOTS partisans get strongly rated program Celebration Master items including Nicklas ""Lord"" Bendtner and Seydou Doumbia. And of course the big prize is the final vote winner, Beşiktaş (and Portugal) midfielder, Ricardo Quaresma. As the Program Legend, Quaresma gets a +3 DRI (All) +2 ACC (All) boost packing 99-overall unlockable item. You'll need all seven upgraded Master players and a decent number of Celebration and Bonfire tokens to make it happen.
Here are the upgraded Summer Celebration players and Legend Quaresma's ratings and boosts:


Leander Dendoncker - Anderlecht - CDM - 94 OVR - +5 SPA to Pro League, +3 STR to All
Hakim Ziyech - Ajax - CM - 93 OVR - +5 BAC to Eredivisie, +3 SHO to All
Ricardo Quaresma (Program Legend) - Beşiktaş - RM - 99 OVR - +3 DRI to All, +2 ACC to All
Ricardo Quaresma - Beşiktaş - RM - 94 OVR - +5 DRI to Super Lig, +3 LSA to All
Gelson Martins - Sporting - RWB - 94 OVR - +5 ACC to Liga Nos, +3 REA to All
Quincy Promes - Spartak Moskva - RW - 93 OVR - +5 SPD to Russian, +3 POS to All
Nicklas Bendtner - Rosenborg - ST - 95 OVR - +5 FIN to Eliteserien, +3 HEA to All
Seydou Doumbia - FC Basel - CF - 94 OVR - +5 SPD to Swiss, +3 REA to All"

With EA Play done and dusted, all FIFA 18 focus now points towards Gamescom and those all important game mode reveals! So with that in mind, let's take a look at some key areas we'd like to see updated this year in FIFA 18's Career Mode. 
Youth academies
Youth academies have been in Career Mode for as long as I can remember, and yet I can’t actually recall them ever changing? The menu styling is the same; the features are the same; even the talent they generate is largely the same. 
My main issues with the current implementation (despite its general stagnation) is the fact everything within the Youth Academy setup operates on a ""pull"" basis. Unless you actually go looking for information, the academy on its own adds little to no value to your play through. 
What I’d much rather see is a monthly report (from an academy manager perhaps?) on who’s developing well, who’s not and recommended new academy prospects to sign. Not just as an email for us to ignore, but as a well crafted overlay which interrupts the flow of the mode and forces its way on screen. That way you’re much more likely to proactively manage those bright young talents into your first team squad and the academy itself becomes a valuable standalone. 
Transfers
It’s a problem which plagues a decent portion of Career Mode sadly, but transfers are an area where the continual lack of new development stings the most. It’s one of the core reason we all play the mode after all. There’s nothing quite like the feeling of landing a wonderkid for peanuts, or a superstar forward for millions and yet Career Mode offer us very few tools to put these incredibly complex deals together. 
The big miss is buyout clauses, which are now so common, and so integral, to the annual transfer circus we watch on social media every day. Buyouts should of course work both ways, so as well as activating them, you could also insert them in to your own players' contracts when they renew. When you think about it, the potential for branching storylines, player conversations, and media speculation based on tranfer buyout clauses alone is massive.

As well as that, there are a host of regularly seen transfer variables which the mode doesn’t yet cater for either. None of these are easy to implement due to the logic behind the scenes required to govern them, but EA should make ticking them a priority this year and going forward: 

Sell-on fee percentages
Signing-on fees for free transfers
Buy back clauses
Performance based add-ons

Team training
I really like the implementation of player training in Career Mode as it’s quick, efficient and the feedback from the system is easy to use. I do think training, once setup, should run automatically on a schedule, however, rather than requiring a button press each and every time (I always forget) just to make it feel less of an administrative task. 
The thing really missing though is Team Training, which for me should directly correlate to a team style which you are trying to develop as a manager. It should take time for players to adjust (and perhaps some never will) but being able to guide the style of football you want your team to play is sorely missing from Career Mode.
Wenger (#WengerOut) is famous for his managerial ethos, as is Mourinho, Klopp, and many beyond. Yet there’s no real way to cultivate that in Career Mode apart from adjusting some sliders in the Tactics menu. Team Training could be the perfect vehicle to get more varied and more dynamic team styles into the mode. 
Presentation and flow
These are small issues in the grand scheme of things, and perhaps that’s why they annoy me so much. Because Career Mode at times does an amazing job at hiding information from you which would make the mode more interesting and believable.
After each league or cup game, for example, you see a screen which shows the week's results (minus your team for some reason) and then you’re dumped straight back to the main menu. It would be so simple and so nice to have Career Mode present a full screen view of the league or tournament as well, noting any changes in placement. Rather than having to squint at a small tile in the bottom right of the main menu screen. 
That tile, as we know, updates depending on which competition you’re playing in. So if you’re say in the Champions League it shows your group standings, but only before a match is playerd. After the match is played, it flips back to show the next competition. So you never actually see how your group standings are changing unless you delve in to it yourself. And that is literally the most interesting bit of European competition missed, purely because of poor information flow. 
All it needs is minor tweaks to the flow of menu presentation and Career Mode could make a huge impact to the experience, as a result of a very small change. 
Press conferences
If there’s one other key feature of Career Mode which is more unloved than youth academies, then it’s press conferences. They still have the same visual stylings (if you can call it that) they had in FIFA 09, and those same mostly nonsensical options to either praise or unnerve the opposition. 
If they hadn’t released The Journey last year, EA may have been able go another year without developing them further. But with Alex Hunter’s BioWare style dialogue wheel fresh in our minds, we’ve seen the art of the possible, and as a result Career Mode needs to step up its game in this area. 
To be honest, I think The Journey in general has made Career Mode seem more lacking than it perhaps is because there were so many neat touches in EA’s new flagship mode, which many assumed would cross over to Career Mode. No one is expecting a narrative driven experience like The Journey in Career Mode, but at the very least, that shared technology should be driving both modes forwards in tandem. 

That’s our list, but there’s of course many more features and new ideas out there to explore. So hit us up in the comments with your very own wish list for Career Mode in FIFA 18."

                        Back to the dreaded international week... We do have potential for a Ronaldo, Neymar and Thiago though.
                    

Last week's score: 15/23
Formation: 3-4-2-1 Squad link: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/5419955/

Goalkeeper
Danijel Subasic - GK -OVR 84
If there’s one position which I hate for these weeks, it's the goalkeepers and now that we are looking for two golds it becomes even harder. The first selected is Subasic who made a total of four saves as Croatia remained unbeaten with a 1-0 win over Ukraine.
Defenders
Jonas Hector - LB -OVR 81
The first of two German IF's to be predicted for their 4-1 win over Azerbaijan is their LB, Hector. The Koln wingback helped chip in with two of the assists which when you are selecting from below 50 matches really does stand out.
Lukasz Pisczek - RB -OVR 82
The first of three Dortmund players to feature this week is Pisczek and although that seems absurd seeing as they all come from different matches I don't see why it should take a toll. The Polish RB scored the winning goal in the 82nd minute as Poland beat Montenegro 2-1, which should see them top the group baring disaster.
Theodor Gebre Selassie - RB -OVR 76
Another nation which I have opted to award two IF's to is that of the Czech Republic. No surprise that they played against San Marino then. The RB claimed both a goal and assist and although a clean sheet is pretty much guaranteed the fact that he has one will only help his cause.
Midfielders
Andre Schurrle - RM -OVR 81
It seems strange predicting two German IF's for what was a less than convincing performance but both players on paper deserve their spot. Schurrle was involved in three of the four goals, scoring twice and assisting another. If Germany only get one IF it will be this man.
Dusan Tadic - CAM -OVR 79
Usually I would have ignored Tadic due to the proximity of his last IF but during these International sides you can't really afford to be picky, so with a goal and two assists it would have been naive to ignore the Serbian. There are contrasting line-ups however the official Uefa site suggests CAM.
Thiago - CAM -OVR 85
Personally, just looking at an 89 rated Thiago feels wrong but that could well become a reality after the Spaniard picked up two assists during their 4-1 home win over Israel.
Neymar - LW -OVR 92
Paulinho stole the show for Brazil with a hat trick from midfield however seeing as though he is not in the game it leaves the door open for Neymar who scored one and assisted another during their impressive 4-1 away win over Uruguay.
Carlos Vela - RW - OVR 82
Vela grabbed a couple of assists for Mexico during their 2-0 win over Costa Rica which resulted in them claiming first place in the group. CB Araujo scored one of the golds but with Vela being gold I believe that the preference will be given to him.
Cristiano Ronaldo - LW -OVR 94
We have seen re-releases happen before with these elite players and with Ronaldo playing out wide instead of his usual striker position I feel as though this could be a chance for EA to implement it. Ronaldo after all was one of the best players over the international break. He scored two of Portugal's three goals from the left side and claimed Goal's player of the week, not that that really means much but it’s still there.
Forwards
Olivier Giroud - ST -OVR 83
Giroud has been out of favour for Arsenal, largely due to the performances of Sanchez but even so that has limited his game time. He proved that he still has it in his locker though scoring twice for France in their 3-1 away win.
Substitutes
Stefanos Kapino - GK -OVR 75
Another keeper punt now with Kapino after he helped his Greek side to a 1-1 away draw against the hyped Belgium. Greece ended the match with 9 men which I believe will help him to stand out even though he failed to keep a clean sheet and with just four saves has nothing to shout about on paper. He did make a tremendous double save towards the tail end of the match though.
Emil Forsberg - LM -OVR 79
After a breakthrough couple of seasons domestically Forsberg has made it to the big stage, playing internationally for Sweden. He managed to score his 4th and 5th goals for them on Saturday during a comfortable 4-0 win over Belarus and thus looks set to pick up his TIF.
Vladimir Darida - CM -OVR 79
I personally wanted Barak, who scored twice and assisted another, for this spot but seeing as he is not in the game it opens the door for his teammate, Darida. Darida also scored two goals during Czech Republic's routine 6-0 win over San Marino.
Christian Pulisic - CM -OVR 74
The first of two players to get in from USA's 6-0 thrashing of Honduras in the young talent of Pulisic. The Dortmund youngster picked up a goal and two assists and although he was not the star man due to hype I can see him getting the nod.
Vedad Ibisevic - ST -OVR 80
It's safe to say that the Bundesliga lot were the ones to show up with no less than nine being included in my prediction. Ibisevic is the final one and is included for his brace against Gibraltar in their 5-0 win.
Clint Dempsey - ST -OVR 79
Obviously, that stand out player mentioned under Pulisic was Clint Dempsey. At 33 years, old it could be argued that he is near the end of his career, at least internationally but with another three goals to his name many will be hoping that there’s still a few years left in him yet.
Cenk Tosun - ST -OVR 78
It was only a couple of weeks ago, that Tosun was snubbed for a hat trick purely for the fact it was played on a Monday. He only scored twice this time around but seeing as it was during an international break it makes him almost a certainty to make the cut.
Reserves
Juan Carlos - GK -OVR 69
With the new format in place it becomes difficult for both Silver and Bronze keepers to make the cut and they could well miss out again here. Carlos does make a strong case though, especially with the lack of games being played after making nine saves to help keep a clean sheet.
Gonzalo Martinez - CDM -OVR 73
This one is a bit of a punt, especially seeing as it's for a silver item but Martinez was fantastic in both the matches he played this week. Firstly claiming a goal and assist in their 3-1 win on Wednesday before scoring again in a 2-1 win on Sunday.
Ilja Nestorovski - ST -OVR 73
Nestorovski could quite easily have made himself a certainty had he not missed a last-minute penalty but because he did instead of a hat trick he comes into the selection process with a brace and a missed pen. I can't see the minor lapse taking too much of a toll though and a brace at international level is still an impressive feat and thus I have selected him over domestic braces.
Spas Delev - ST -OVR 64
Bulgaria recorded one of the few upsets caused in European qualification recording a 2-0 win at home to the Netherlands. Delev was the stand out player scoring both of those goals which should secure his spot.
Brendon Santalab - ST -OVR 63
The A-league still played their domestic football over the weekend and thus a player who has been in contention several times is now in line to pick up an IF. Santalab scored all three WSW goals in their 3-1 home win over Melbourne"

A poor showing last week saw me get only 1/4 correct. Let’s hope this week will be a bit better in a week with two different players on offer, each in two different positions. 

Liverpool v Tottenham
On paper, this should be a very good game as the two top scoring players, and second and third highest scoring clubs face off. Both teams come into the game off the back of a solid midweek win after two disappointing results, with Spurs dominant 2-0 win over Manchester United one of the big highlights of the midweek matchday.
Liverpool’s purchase of Van Dijk showed that they know where they need to improve, and aren't afraid to pay to get who they think they need. Their defensive issues showed with back-to-back losses to Swansea and West Brom, but recovered with a confidence boosting 3-0 win over Huddersfield. 
Spurs have managed to stretch their unbeaten run to nine games,with just one loss to Manchester City in their last 14 games. However, they have tended to struggle when away from home this season, with just three away wins from their last 11 games - beating Swansea, Burnley and a poor Dortmund side.
I'm sure you'll find this game just as difficult to call as I am, and after changing my mind last time Liverpool featured, changing from a Liverpool win to a Man City win, I am in two minds about hedging against the hosts again.
Game time: Sunday, 4 February, 4:30 p.m. (GMT) / 11:30 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Liverpool win

Borussia Monchengladbach v RB Leipzig
The battle for Champions League/Europa League qualification in Germany is close to say the least. Just three points separate second and seventh, with five qualification spots available come May. The game we are looking at this week is between seventh place Gladbach and fifth place Leipzig. 
In a rather interesting pattern of form, Gladbach have won/drawn a game and then lost repeatedly since mid-November. A loss to Frankfurt last weekend, another European chasing team, will make them hope their run of form continues. However, they lost keeper Yann Sommer to injury early on in their games against Frankfurt, so will be hoping that back-up choice Sippel is able to fill the void left by the Swiss international. 
Leipzig’s form recently has been less impressive, with just one win in their last eight competitive games. A solid 3-1 win over high-flying Schalke have them a great start to the Rückrunde, but a loss to midtable Freiburg was followed by a draw against relegation battlers Hamburg to see them dip to their pre-winter break form again.
I believe that Gladbach will keep their pattern of results going by picking up at least one point this weekend. The sides have only met three times before - Leipzig winning one and two draws - so I feel like a draw may be the most likely result. 
Game time: Saturday, 3 February, 5:30 p.m. (GMT) / 12:30 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw

Las Palmas v Malaga
It’s only just into February and this is already a big relegation six-pointer. Second bottom host bottom in a match that is a must win for both sides as they aim to push towards safety. As would be expected, neither side is in great form, which makes predicting this game that little bit more difficult.
Las Palmas pulled off a big shock result a couple of weeks back, beating nine-man Valencia 2-1, with that being their first win since early December. However, the other three of their last four games have been 4-0, 6-0 and 3-0 away losses. They will be very low on confidence, and their defensive problems certainly won’t help them as they try and turn their season around.
Malaga are struggling for form, but they have managed to keep their defence fairly solid with just seven goals conceded in their last seven games. However, it is up front that they have been having issues with just three goals scored in those games. Two draws in their last two games has helped them stop their losing streak, and they will be hoping that they can push on to a victory on Monday to move ahead of their opponents and to within three points of safety.
I can see this game being very close, and a  draw wouldn't be a shock result given both teams recent records. I feel that Malaga’s strong defence may give them the advantage in that regard, and with new signing Lestienne, they have brought in a talented winger who will try and bring some creativity and threat to their attack. 
Game time: Monday 5 February, 7:00 p.m. (GMT) / 2:00 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Malaga win

San Lorenzo v Boca Juniors
In a fixture opposite to the previous one, second host first in Argentina. Both teams have had a couple of losses recently and will be hoping to keep their good start to the season going.
San Lorenzo sit six points behind their opponents, having drawn three games near the start of the season before going on a good run of six wins in seven games. 
Boca Juniors are six points clear at the top of the league and boast the best attack and defence in the league, with a goal difference double that of the next best side. Two losses in a row just before the winter break made them stutter slightly, but three wins since has seen them keep their six point lead at the top of the table. They lost all three of their games in the pre-season Torneos de Verano, so that may still be playing on their minds as they aim to keep their league form going.
These sides have not met in over a year, making it that little bit tougher to try and tell what will happen. It should be a close game, but I feel like Boca’s league dominance will overpower and they should take the advantage.
Game time: Sunday 4 February, 10:15 p.m. (GMT) / 5:15 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Boca Juniors

That’s what I think will happen this week, what about you?
The rewards are slightly different this week, with two different players available in two positions each. Spurs' versatile defender/midfielder Eric Dier and Liverpool’s Joe Gomez both have a CB card with Dier also having a CDM and Gomez a RB card available. With the cards being 82 Overall, they will cost a reduced three tokens, with the alternative offer of 125k or 950k coins for one and four tokens respectively.
Good luck and happy predicting!"

                        The last season of Attack Mode as we know it
                    

Tomorrow, April 27th, the current season of Attack Mode in FIFA Mobile will end, and the following season will be the last season in the current format.
Whilst EA are being pretty cryptic about what the changes are, stating that more details will be available soon, they have laid out the details we need to know concerning the way things will play out for the end of this season, as well as next, and what you'll be able to do with existing tokens.
That means these May Masters will be the last player rewards.
 
In short, you've got this season and the upcoming May season to pick up the tokens you need to spend on any of the April Master players or upcoming May Master players or claim the last available FIFA Champion tokens to grab 99 Griezmann. After that, those rather valuable tokens will be resigned to only being useable in the token exchange plans, and no one wants that.
To help with that FIFA Champion token, the next season of Attack Mode will run a little longer, although that extension will only be for a few days.
Get grinding."

The forecasters had speculated that we'd see as many as four or more dynamic Ones to Watch items get ratings increases.
With the special black automatically updating in-form items still in packs (and Squad Building Challenges) until Friday, the predictions came true. Summer OTW Mohamed Salah goes all the way up to a daunting 89-overall following his brilliant near-match winner vs Spurs over the weekend. From the new Winter batch, Arsenal's Henrikh Mkhitaryan bumps up to 86 overall (those wondering, his 86 LM item will be available in packs Friday as soon as the OTW promo is over). Ex-Arsenal player Theo Walcott's midweek excellence sees his Everton 80 rise to 83 while the Chelsea loaned-out Michy Batshuayi will surely be thrilled to learn his MOTM performance in his Dortmund debut takes him up to 85 overall.
While hardly under the radar, Nathan Ake's rise to an 81 pace 84 overall CB will surely turn some heads. And if you've been loooking for a beast Brazilian LB, this latest IF for FC Porto's Alex Telles would appear to be just that. If we had to reach for a true sleeper this week, Fiorentina's LW Federico Chiesa might be decent value with his new 81 overall IF.

                        Less empathy for gold players this week.
                    

Last week's score: 9/18
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad Link: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7027613/

Goalkeeper
Andre Blake - GK - 72 OVR
It's looking like another week without a gold keeper with two silvers excelling again. Andre Blake was the stand out keeper after he made a penalty save to go alongside four others to keep his clean sheet and in turn help Philadelphia to three points in a 1-0 win over DC United.
Defenders
Kim Jin Su - LB - 74 OVR
The first of two Jeonbuk players from a game played on Wednesday, which is risky, but his two brilliant performances makes him hard to ignore. Kim Jin Su was officially Man of the Match after the leftback grabbed both a goal and an assist in their 4-1 home win claiming a match rating of 7.5.
Drew Moor - CB - 71 OVR
Toronto came away with a comfortable 2-0 win at home to New England with their central defender Drew Moor standing out. The American scored what looked to be the only goal of the match before a familiar face in Giovinco popped up in the 95th minute to lock down the three points.
Ike Opara - CB - 72 OVR
There’s no saying if Opara's Scream item will be accounted for in terms of whether he will become a silver or gold in-form, but as you can see, due to the previous upgrade, I have decided to count it. As for why he deserves this spot, the KC defender scored a spectacular overhead kick to help Sporting KC to a 2-1 away win over LA Galaxy.
Midfielders
Emiliano Rigoni - LM - 76 OVR
I did state that I would be showing less empathy towards gold players. However, when a player performs to the level that Emiliano Rigoni did, they tend to waltz right into the side regardless. The winger ran the show during Independiente's 3-0 away win scoring two of the three goals and deservedly picking up MOTM by quite a distance.
Federico Higuain - CAM - 77 OVR
It's safe to say that Federico is the less accomplished of the Higuain brothers, but he does consistently do well in the MLS on the positive side of things. He added another two goals to his name this weekend during a 4-1 Columbus Crew win.
David Accam - LM - 73 OVR
As far as silver IFs go, David Accam must be set to become one of the best. There is no doubt about his spot after he dominated for Chicago Fire, managing to score three of his own goals alongside assisting another in a 4-0 win.
Pal Andre Helland - RW - 73 OVR
There are two players which could make the cut for Rosenborg after their 3-0 home win. The first of which is Pal Andre Helland, who assisted all three of their goals, though teammate Milan Jevtovic scored twice. I opted for Helland simply for the fact he picked up MOTM alongside my inability to see two Rosenborg IFs, but it could well happen.
Dani Pacheco - RM - 74 OVR
Dani Pacheco will without a doubt go down as a Hero item after Getafe managed to turn around a 1-0 defeat from the first leg of their promotion playoff final in a superb 3-1 return fixture. The winger scored two of the three goals to help Getafe win the fixture and ultimately get promoted to LaLiga Santander.
Forwards
Edu - ST - 76 OVR
Midweek games are always fun when it comes to projecting as you never know what’s going to happen. With the lack of leagues playing once again, I believe with a full set of fixtures coming from them they will be included. Edu is one that appears from them after his brace helped Jeonbuk of the K League Classic to a 4-1 home win.
Dario Benedetto - ST - 76 OVR
Despite the fact Dario Benedetto recently picked up a TOTS item, he still has plenty of room for informs. The Argentine scored twice for Boca this weekend in their 2-1 win and with him being gold, I can see that being enough for him to get into the side.
Substitutes
Augusto Batalla - GK - 66 OVR
There is some hype in Argentina surrounding the potential of Batalla, and he showed what he was capable of on Thursday during River Plate's narrow 1-0 home win. The stopper made a total of seven saves to keep his clean sheet and with defender Lucas Martínez Quarta, who scored the only goal, not being in FIFA, it only increases the keeper’s chances.
Rasmus Lindkvist - LB - 65 OVR
Ghayas Zahid picked up the official MOTM award from this match. However, considering he recently picked up a silver TOTS item, I am opting for his teammate, Rasmus Lindkvist. Rasmus received the same match rating as Zahid for his two assists from LB, and although there was no clean sheet to boast about, he is a very strong candidate for the side.
Sebastian Dubarbier - LM - 74 OVR
Dubarbier played in a more attacking role to his usual LB position and he performed just how the manager would have hoped, picking up a goal and MOTM in his side's 2-0 win. It's a bit of a punt, but with a high match rating, it could well happen.
Patricio Vidal - LM - 64 OVR
There was a lot of Argentine options this week with the division having two full sets of fixtures. Patricio Vidal is the final one I have selected and he is also one of the better performers. He was involved in all three of his side's goals, scoring two of his own alongside an assist.
Lars Veldwijk - ST - 70 OVR
Aalesund recorded an impressive 5-1 win over Odd. Striker Lars Veldwijk stood out from the match scoring three of the five, which makes him the easiest player to predict this week.
Jack McBean - ST - 62 OVR
First thing's first, McBean's got a brilliant name. He scored twice for LA Galaxy in a 3-1 away win as they finally seem to be picking up some form. Once again Alessandrini proved to be a brilliant signing for LA, but it was McBean who shone in this one.
Yang Dong Hyen - ST - 70 OVR
We end the week with another K-League mid-week fixture. This time it comes from Pohang's 3-0 win away to Incheon with a player who often pops up at this time of the year in Yang Dong Hyen. The striker was involved in all their goals with two of his own going alongside an assist."

OTW Weekend is brought to you by @GummiFifa!
This weekend is an unsual OTW Weekend. I think it is fair to title it an International OTW Weekend. International games count into the TOTW, and therefore OTW items are eligible to receive an upgrade if they are selected in the TOTW. International friendly games also count in the TOTW. However, the player has to have an exceptional performance to make it into the TOTW selection. 
It is fair to say that Ones to Watch items have been a major hit in FIFA 17. In particular, the trading and investing community has taken to these cards because of the relative ease at which you can earn coins by trading with them. We have seen many investors earn millions off of well-timed OTW trades!
I’ve prepared an International OTW list for the weekend of 23-27th March to help you trade this weekend. Keep in mind, although some players are likely to start, I can obviously not guarantee that they will start. Predictions are taken from Whoscored.com


Spreadsheet Link
How to Trade with OTW Players
So, now that I’ve peaked your curiosity, I’m sure you are wondering how exactly to trade with OTW cards. There are two main methods that have proven to work every single week.
This first method is to take advantage of bad performances. When a player performs badly (a main indicator is the team losing or the player earning a poor whoscored match rating) his price tends to drop after the game, presumably because many investors and casual players panic sell the card. This provides an opportune window to pick the card up for cheap. Then, throughout the week, his price will slowly rise until game day. While it may be tempting to hold the player until he earns an inform, remembering the pattern from last week, we will want to sell the player on before the next game actually starts (a good time to sell is usually when he is announced in the starting lineup). The reason why we do that is because if he doesn’t perform well in the first 30-45 minutes his price will start to drop as it did the week prior. This is called selling in the hype.
The second method is more profitable but requires more attention. What you have to do is either watch the game that the OTW is playing or you have notifications turned on, on your phone or computer, that notify you straight away when there is a goal. If a OTW player scores in the game his price will skyrocket. However, picking up the player is not easy and you have to be quick. The time frame to pick up a player when he scores is constantly becoming smaller. At this stage in the game, you have around 20 seconds to pick up the player before your room for profit is gone. After these 20 seconds, his price will have already inflated and he won’t be worth picking up.
Trading with OTW players has never been as popular as it is now. This is not only going to make you profit, but it is also entertaining! The key is selling into the hype and not getting caught holding a card too long because of greed. Slow, steady profits will win the race in the long run.
Best of luck,

This weekend, 128 of the world's best FIFA 18 Ultimate Team players -- 64 each from Playstation 4 and Xbox One -- will square off in Barcelona for the first major FIFA esports tournament of the FUT 18 cycle.
The Barcelona FUT Champions Cup, which will be the first event of the FUT Champions Global Series, will feature players who qualified for this competition by placing at the top of the Global Weekend League Leaderboards in November. Unlike last year, these FUT Champions Cup events will not be divided up by region. Instead, they will bring the best eligible FUT Champions players from Europe, the Americas, and the Rest of World regions together in one single event.
The top 16 players from Barcelona, i.e. the top eight from each console, will move on to qualify for the Global Series playoff legs that will come later this year. However, those that don't will also have the opportunity to come back and qualify for the next FUT Champions Cup in April by finishing atop the February Weekend League leaderboards.
Some big names in the FIFA esports scene, namely FIFA Ultimate Team Championship Series champion Corentin 'Vitality Rocky' Chevrey and 2017 FIFA Interactive World Cup champion Spencer 'Unilad Gorilla' Ealing, have already qualified. Spencer 'Spencer FC' Owen's Hastag United will be represented well with three esports players, including Harry 'Hashtag Harry' Hesketh.
Many other FIFA esports stalwarts from last year will also be present, like Shaun 'xShellz' Springette, who was bested by Vitality Rocky in the Berlin Grand Finals last May after emerging as a dark horse, Kai 'Deto' Wollin, who was the runners-up at the FIWC, and Daniele 'IcePrinsipe' Paolucci, who beat eventual 2017 FIWC Champion Unilad Gorilla at the Madrid Regional.
Whoever wins in Barcelona will have to a follow a different path to glory, however, as EA have switched to a new tournament format this year. Here's how it works.
Every match between two players, including the Knockout Stage matches and the Grand Final, will be played over two legs. The player with the higher aggregate score will be declared the winner, but, if the scoreline remains tied after two games, extra-time and penalties will decide the winner.
The Group Stage will be broken up by console, and the players will be seeded based on their qualifying results. What this means is that the No. 1 seed from Xbox One will play the No. 64 seed, and so on; the same goes for the flip side, with Playstation competitors. After the first match based on the seedings, players will then be matched up against others with the same win-loss record. No player will face the same opponent twice. The competitors will have the chance to play up to seven matches in the Group Stage, or 14 games in total. Four wins from seven matches will ensure entry into the Knockout rounds, but if a player loses four matches, they will immediately be eliminated from the competition.
The Knockout Stage is relatively simple. The 32 players to advance from each console will be seeded into a single-elimination bracket based on their win-loss record from the Group Stage. At the end, only two players will remain, one from Xbox One and one from Playstation, and they will go on to play each other in the cross-console Grand Final. In the Grand Final, one game will be played on each console and the player with the higher aggregate score will be declared the champion and get to take home 22,000 dollars.
If you're stilll a little hazy on the way things will play out this weekend, here's a good visual explainer of the new format:

                        Six months on, how does FIFA 17 fare against the greatest football video games of all time? 
                    

Whenever a new FIFA launches the clamour to crown it as either the greatest, or worst sports videogame of all time is unrelenting. Both influencers and journalists alike take to each and every platform that will carry their message to cast that knee-jerk opinion, but very often that initial stab in dark is far from accurate. Because when it comes to era defining sports games, of which there are very few. True success is often found in their ability to continue providing new gameplay experiences over an extended period of time.
Based on that criteria, I think FIFA 17 is one of the best yet.
Having experienced quite a few hands-on sessions with FIFA 17 before its launch, I was at best cautiously optimistic on the game’s prospects. The new competitive elements didn’t really appeal to my personal tastes, Career Mode didn't fare well under testing and there were countless new gameplay elements which on paper at least, alarmed rather than allured. During pre-launch I was probably the least excited for a new FIFA game I’ve ever been, and believe me I’m someone who normally counts down the minutes.
Even after the razzmatazz of FIFA 17’s launch, my playtime with the game was a direct reflection of those early negatives. I really struggled to get into FIFA 17 in the first few weeks of action and with all the noise around patches, FUT Champs connectivity and endless FUT promotions, it was all too much, and my controller was downed in favour of other titles. (Rainbow Six Siege FTW) 
But now, some six months on, having had time to properly digest this FIFA away from the microscope of launch and being able to scope the various nips and tucks EA have made to the gameplay via patches into my opinion. I seem to be enjoying FIFA 17 more and more by the day.
The first major attraction is of course the way FIFA 17 looks. At times it is absolutely gorgeous, especially on the PS4 Pro at 4k resolution. Much is made of sports game close-ups which are of course a huge deal, but from the gameplay camera perspective FIFA 17 is far and away the best in the series (and possibly of any sports game to date). And when that’s paired with the volume of licensing, stadia, faces and environment details which are now so pervasive, the stage really is set for the gameplay to shine. I know football gaming purists would have you believe that core gameplay trumps all. But to even be in the race you need to look the part, otherwise that all important gameplay immersion is easily broken.
And for me FIFA 17 represents one of the best gameplay experiences I’ve had in a long time, and I can’t even believe I’m typing that given my initial feelings about it at launch. But the more time I’ve spent with it, the more I’ve grown to love the flow and intricacy that the controls at our disposal now offer. FIFA has an overwhelming amount of button combo’s and modifiers which isn't always a positive, but I’ve found the sandbox of tools this year to be more rewarding to use than any other before it. I even like the pace injecting Passing with Purpose modifiers, which I felt overwhelmingly negative about initially. 
As it turns out those new modifiers are brilliantly balanced and they add a real sense of risk versus reward in building up attacks from the back. I’ve always felt EA have been too soft on the realism of pass accuracy in the past, because of some vague assumption they seem to make that we can’t handle the ball going out of play or being intercepted. Perhaps understandable given our need to apportion blame to such things under the banner of ""scripting"" but...
That’s why Passing with Purpose is such a refreshing change because as a player I now have a decision to make. Play the simple pass with X, or try to split the defence with one of the modifiers? It’s my choice, and my accepted outcome if it all goes pear shaped. These are choices we’ve never previously been trusted with in FIFA, and I think it speaks volumes that EA are in such a comfortable place with their game design, that they can willingly hand over the reins to these more powerful tools. And do so without the gameplay descending into the ‘ping pong passing’ mess from years gone by.
A quick word on FIFA’s AI too which many overlook as an offline only feature but it actually affects every match in every single game mode. Who else do you think is controlling the other ten players? EA very rarely bang the ""New AI!"" drum, instead opting for quiet evolution. But over the last few years that slow burn has rewarded the game with significant improvements to team shape and positioning which come to fruition in FIFA 17. In a game with so many variables there are always going to be moments when things go awry, but for the most part FIFA 17 is able to host the most cohesive game of football the series has managed in an awful long time. 
Even offline playing against the CPU things are much more akin to real life. I still think EA still need to do a big push on offline AI features for Career Mode to be truly successful, but at least in FIFA 17 attackers try to attack you, strikers shoot instinctively, and defenders clear their lines efficiently. You get the occasional peek behind the curtain when the AI makes a bad call, but these moments are now anomalies rather than the norm. EA need to do much more with team AI but this year it's the gameplay that has kept me going in Career Mode, whereas in all previous years it would have been the opposite. 
And I think that's the key difference in this FIFA, it's actually a fun game to sit down, relax and play. Now I know FUT Champs has even the best players around pulling their hair out (Bateson aside). And in those highly competitive environments, FIFA still has a way to go in terms of being genuinely 'e-sports ready'. But in a more casual environment playing Seasons, Career mode or Online Friend Leagues, where the gameplay naturally has more time and space to breathe, there's an awful lot to like, even love about FIFA 17. 
What FUT Champs has done is further highlight EA’s infrastructure deficiencies, with lag and slowdown more regular community complaints than ever. These were things that could be easily brushed aside in previous games, but not now there’s such a strong competitive edge, with such huge rewards. When things are stable, and matches are flowing properly, I think FIFA 17 is one of the most enjoyable online FIFA titles we've had, but that needs to be more consistent for FIFA to be taken truly seriously as an e-sport. 
My favourite FIFA game of all time is still, and probably always will be FIFA World Cup 2010 (what a game that is) which is closely followed by FIFA 09 purely because I still need to find a way to justify the ungodly amount of hours I put into it. But coming up quietly on the outside, and a little late to the party perhaps, is this years dark horse FIFA 17. Which when everything clicks, successfully merges the beauty of FIFA we’ve come to expect, with the gameplay experience we’ve all too often missed. 
Whether you agree or disagree, one thing is certain. FIFA 18 has an incredible foundation for EA to build on, so let's see if they can take full advantage this year. Let us know your favourite FIFA titles of all time and where FIFA 17 ranks for you, in the comments."

                        Welcome back to another Fut Roundup. It was a relatively dull week in terms of official promotions, so let’s quickly recap before looking to the week ahead, which is shaping up to be quite exciting! 
                    

It is safe to say that the highlight of this past week in the world of football was the Barca vs. PSG game. In one of the most dramatic, controversy ridden comebacks in Champions League history, Barca managed to overcome a 4 goal deficit to move onto the last 8. The event prompted a cryptic series of tweets from Yahsir, an EA live content producer, hinting that some sort of promotion would be coming out in celebration of the historic victory.



Based on the hashtags Yahsir used, many were able to deduce ahead of time that there would be a Hero Sergio Roberto. Unfortunately, the community overhyped the Friday release, with many believing there would be a full hero Barca team. In the end, some were a bit let down by the Sergio Roberto release. On the bright side, many of the other MOTM cards released with Roberto on Friday were highly sought after. Of note, was Tolisso who managed to join the all 80 club with his 85 orange card! 

Also on Friday was the announcement of the POTM. To the surprise of many, Harry Kane came away with the award, earning himself a 91 rated SBC card despite losing the fan voting (this marks the first time the fan voting and panel voting have been in favor of different players). Those that invested in virtually anything Harry Kane related made an absolute killing. This was especially true for Spurs inform cards, which all shot up to max price and had to have their price ranges adjusted. Unfortunately, aside from a possible TOTS card, it looks like this POTM card is going to be Harry Kane’s highest rated card this FIFA. The latest reports on his injury indicated he could be sidelined for up to seven weeks. As a side note, for those that were disappointed with their Lukaku investments, this is yet another example of why selling into the hype is so important.

In miscellaneous news, the TOTW 25 selection on Wednesday was met with confusion. In particular, many were shocked to see that Messi had missed out on an inform again, despite a 2 goal, 2 assist, MOTM performance. This served as fuel to the conspiracy theorist’s fires, many of whom claim there is some sort of beef between EA and their former cover boy, Messi. In addition, as I’m sure you’ve noticed if you are active on twitter or the FIFA reddit, the days of early SBC and TOTW leaks are numbered. As can be seen by this twitter interaction between Yahsir (the EA live content producer) and Bateson, it would appear that EA are planning on encrypting the online media database where many have been accessing SBC and TOTW information early. 

In general, prices have been creeping downward the past couple weeks, with legends showing the most consistent decline. While this downward trend was expected after the rebound from the two weekends of restrictive requirements, it does seem rather ominous that prices are going down despite three weeks of open weekend league requirements. Could this be a sort of calm before the storm? We are set to have quite the lineup of promotional events at the end of March that could spark a lot of movement on the market. In other market related news, many Irish players, especially low priced informs, have increased dramatically in price as we inch closer to Saint Patrick’s Day. The same goes for low priced 81-84 rated gold cards which have jumped up in price in anticipation of a guaranteed TOTW SBC. 
FUT - The Week Ahead
As mentioned, this coming week has the potential to be quite lively. As we look to the week ahead, we will focus our analysis on three main events; a potential Saint Patrick's Day promotion, a potential FUT Anniversary/Birthday Event, and the two batches of MOTM cards set to come out this week. Before we jump into each of those events, however, here is a calendar that I posted on my twitter (@FUT_Economist), made to help organize my investing for the month of March. Obviously, these are just predictions (as we’ve seen already with the TOTW SBC prediction, some will be incorrect), but hopefully you can find it useful. As a correction/addition, it should be noted that Champions League based MOTM cards come out on Fridays. 

Saint Patrick's Day Promotion - March 15th
This year, Saint Patrick’s Day fall on a Friday (March 17th). However, because of the pattern from previous years and the proximity to the potential FUT Anniversary event, it is likely that the promotion will start on Wednesday the 15th. 
In years past, EA has held a tournament to celebrate the holiday. Usually, there were Irish player requirements and huge prizes, providing for ample investing opportunities in high end Irish players. However, this year, it is unlikely that EA will do a tournament given that they will want the competitive players to focus on Fut Champs. This means that we are more likely to see an SBC of some sort in its place. There is also a good chance that we’ll see Irish Green cards again, as evidenced by the green cards already in the database and previous Saint Patrick’s Days. 

There is a theory going around that EA might boost the stats of these green cards over the weekend similar to what was done the with the Halloween Scream cards. This would certainly make things interesting in terms of the promotion that EA could do. If they were to do this, it would make an SBC that guaranteed an Irish Green card all that more attractive. 

We are also nearly guaranteed to get another kit SBC but the requirements for that would likely be nothing to write home about. Other theories include loan legend SBCs for the Irish legend Keane and a TOTW guaranteed SBC. Of course, we’ll talk about investing and trading down in the coin making section. 

MOTM Releases - March 15/17th
We are also likely to see two batches of MOTM card releases with one on Wednesday and one on Friday. The one on Wednesday would be for the FA cup matches where fan favorites Kante and Son are likely to get MOTM cards, and the one on Friday would be for the second batch of champions league matches (see below). 


FUT Anniversary/Birthday Promotions - March 20th
This week, we can also look forward to one of the more anticipated events of the year in the form of the FUT Birthday Celebration. Based on previous years, it appears that EA purposely run this event during the international break. That would mean that the event would start on the 20th and continue until the 27th. This year would be EA’s 8th year of FUT. While this is not a milestone celebration in terms of the year, many anticipate that this will be a major promotion considering that it coincides with the international break and how big the event was last year.

This year we can expect a batch of position change cards again, but, as we mentioned earlier, now that we have the weekend league, it is unlikely that EA will do a tournament that would draw the competitive players away from that competition. Therefore, we anticipate that they will do SBCs in the place of a tournament. There are many theories about which type of SBCs we might see, some include;

Guaranteed TOTW SBC
SBCs for Position Changed cards
SBCs for players with birthdays during March
SBCs for players who wear the number 8
Daily SBCs for international teams
And many more...

As you can see, there are a wide variety of theories. Because of this, it is difficult to corner any specific possibility. Thus, we will have to use low risk, blanket investing techniques. We will talk about these in the coin making section.


Making Coins this Week
Before we get into the specific investing/selling tips for this week, let’s start with some general club management advice that is applicable virtually all year round. That is, if at any point in the year, you find yourself struggling to come up with a compelling investment thesis, you can virtually never go wrong by being liquid (having the majority of your club’s value in the form of coins). This is because as the year goes on, in general, the prices of cards steadily drop. This means that the value of a single coin slowly goes up as the year goes on. In this way, being liquid while player prices go down is akin to a long term, slow growing investment. This advice is especially useful if you are going to be away from FIFA for an extended period of time. If you don’t have your coins actively working for you (in investments), you might as well have them slowly growing. Now that we have that covered, let’s get into some more specific advice.
High Rated Card Restocking
The prices of high rated/low demand cards are once again low. For example, someone like Lahm can be bought in the 13-15k range. The prices of these types of players could drop even lower during Saint Patrick’s Day promotions. My guess is that we could see high rated SBCs for Fut Birthday. If we don’t see them then, it it likely that we’ll see them for TOTS at a minimum. You can never go wrong with investments like this. 
Last Minute Irish Investments/Sell Day
As we mentioned before the prices of many of the Irish special cards have been high for some time now. However, some of the lower risk Irish cards can still be bought for cheap. With this in mind, I would recommend selling your high risk investments early, before the promotion drops, and hold onto your low risk investments as they have not risen that substantially as of yet. 
82-85 Club Restocking
Under the radar, 82-85 rated gold cards are trading at relatively low prices. This is especially true after the anticipation of a TOTW SBC last week that was ultimately met with disappointment and panic selling. The market seems to have forgot how useful these cards can be for these SBCs. If you haven’t already, now would be a great time to restock your club full of one of each of the cheaper cards in each rating iteration. 
Once you do this, you can hold them until late March because we have Saint Patrick's Day and the FIFA Birthday event coming up which both have TOTW SBC potential. 
One type of card to look at in particular are the newly upgraded cards in each of these rating iterations. Many of them don’t have their SBC potential priced in yet and are trading at extremely low prices. 
Sniping Refreshes & Trick Listing
As we discussed above, the prices of many of the newly upgraded cards are trading at steep premiums. However, believe it or not, there are many average FUT players that are unaware of this and will list the upgraded versions at the price of the original. This provides ample opportunities for sniping. 
Look for players that are traded in high volumes (usually low rated cards that are popular, eg. Kante) and see if you can snipe them. I’ve had many people on twitter send me screenshots of these players sniped at prices that would even be considered snipes for the original card.
The best times to do this are when the upgraded cards are freshly released. Unfortunately, this means that the much of the window for sniping has passed. However, assuming you are reading this the couple hours after it was posted, we have the 100+ rest of the world rating refreshes to look forward to. 
This also works better if there is a high volume of packs being opened. One time to be on the lookout for this is when weekend league rewards are released on Thursday. 
If you need tips on sniping, there are many tutorials on youtube that demonstrate the most effective way to refresh your search without being transfer banned
If you manage to pick up one of these cards, make sure that you list it as soon as possible. The prices of these upgraded cards are likely to trend down. 
League SBC investing
There are a number of League SBCs that have yet to drop, including the Premier League and Bundesliga. 
For those of you that don’t know, in order to complete the league SBCs, you essentially need to turn in full squads for each team in the league to get the reward at the end (which often includes a large sum of coins and a special card for the top scorer from the previous season).
With this in mind, there are a number of players on different teams (especially in the lesser known leagues) that only have one player in the game for certain positions. When the league SBC drop, the demand for players will be focused on them because they are the only option that can be used to complete the squad.
Ideally, you will want to identify these players and invest in them before the league SBC drops. The best type of player to invest in would be silver players who are the only option in their position. The relative rarity of silver players generally causes them to go extinct whereas gold players will rise but often not to extinction because they are packed more frequently. 
Still Sitting on POTM Lukaku Investments?
If you decided to take the risk and hold onto your POTM Lukaku investments, especially the risky ones, you are now looking at a steep lose if you haven’t sold already. However, there may be hope. Although King has a commanding lead on the POTM race thus far, one good performance from Lukaku could catapult him into contention. With this in mind, if you haven’t sold these investments already, it is likely worth holding onto them until the end of the month see if Lukaku is among the candidates."

With various cup competitions happending over the weekend, TOTW 20 was always going to be fairly light on quality and difficult to predict. But that didn't deter Aaron one bit as he left just six players for us to review. Leading the line is the TOTY robbed Toni Kroos who was back to his imperious best on the weekend. 
Toni Kroos - CM - Real Madrid
Say it quietly, but Real Madrid seem to be over their horrendous run of form with a 4-1 win against Valencia surely drawing a close to the recent drama. Ronaldo was back amongst the goals with two penalties, but their main man in the middle of the park Toni Kroos was at his metronomic best completing 83 of his 89 passes. And he capped that fine passing display with a goal of his own in the 88th minute. Top performance.

Aaron's View: I opted for Marcelo but due to the fact he was featured in the TOTY EA have decided it was too early. Instead we have a player who was robbed of a TOTY spot making the TOTW for a single goal. Another case of EA being unable to include the clear option, so looking for an alternatives from the same match.
Filip Kostic - CF - Hamburg
Now this is an odd one. Hamburg as we know are struggling in the Bundesliga and that alone should make IF’s hard to come by. But this is now Filipe Kostic’s second IF when he’s scored just 3 goals in 14 appearances. The latest of his goals came in Hamburgs 1-1 draw with RB Leipzig where there was more than a hint of offside in his strike. So one offside goal, in a draw to grab your second IF. Does Kostic have nudes of EA? We’ll find out next week when we review his Hero IF. 
Aaron's View: One goal in a 1-1 draw with no TOTW inclusion from Kicker. Realistically I was never going to get this one.
Soualiho Meite - CM - Bordeaux
Its now back-to-back wins for Bordeaux in Ligue 1 with their weekend result against high flying Lyon coming as somewhat of a surprise. Whilst 3-1 looks convincing they were incredibly lucky to receive a penalty for the “foul” on Malcom but with Otavio being sent off with 20 minutes to go they did well to weather the storm. It’s Meite however who quietly nabs the IF with a solid performance and an assist. 
Aaron's View: I think this one comes due to the fact it was against Lyon, with Bordeaux winning 3-1 with 10 men. Meite picked up a 7 from L’Equipe but seeing as the Lyon goal was as a result of a Meite error I think better options were available, with this one feeling a little forced.
Juanfran - RB - Atletico Madrid
Valencia’s loss allowed Atletico Madrid to tighten their grip on second place in La Liga with a comfortable 3-0 win at home to Las Palmas. Torres, Griezmann and Correa were among the goals and Niguez was probably the ‘star’ performer on the day but Juan Fran (again) quietly nabs the IF with a clean sheet and an assist from right back. 
Aaron's View: One assist from Juanfran but as is often the case with La Liga players the lack of three stars from Marca was the deciding factor my end.
Hendrik Van Crombrugge - GK - KAS Eupen
Eupen are second bottom in the Belgian Juplier League but 7 points from a possible 12 have brought them closer to the pack in recent weeks. With two games possibly in the frame for TOTW 20 in Belgium, goalkeeper Crombrugge gets himself in for recording two clean sheets in a week. And when you’ve conceded 48 in the previous 22 games, that’s a pretty good turnaround. 
Aaron's View: This is arguably the only one I could have predicted as I was struggling for keepers and clearly EA were in the same boat. Crombrugge made several saves to keep his clean sheet in tact but it came down to him being silver eventually and therefore with EA’s preference to pick two gold keepers in past weeks I followed the trend instead.
Santiago Arias - RB - PSV
Four wins on the spin for PSV in the Netherlands send them 7 points clear of Ajax who could only manage a draw against Utrecht. PSV beat Twente fairly comfortably 2-0 with star man Hirving Lozano netting inside 3 minutes. The second goal in comparison took a long to to arrive with Arias completing the win in the 89th minute to go with his clean sheet.
Aaron's View: *Another player with just the one goal to their name. Arias was not in the top 5 VI ranked players and with Berghuis already getting in I was not expecting another Eredivisie player this week. *"

I found it nigh on impossible to select gold keepers this week. There were a couple of Silver ones which stood out but with the amount of hat tricks they became unavailable. One keeper which is possible comes with Horn who claimed a 1.5 from Kicker but with another obvious Koln choice there is no guarantee that he will make it.
Defenders
Sead Kolasinac - LB - OVR 77
Kolasinac was snubbed in favour of Burgstaller last week but there is no chance of it happening again after the Bosnian defender scored the only goal of the game in Schalke's 1-0 win over Mainz.
Diego Godin - CB - OVR 88
Truth be told it was not the best performance that Godin has ever put in but with the lack of gold defenders and the lack of big names he could well make the side. The Atletico defender scored one claimed 2 from Marca and more importantly made it into their TOTW.
Eric Bailly - CB - OVR 82
There was a severe lack of BPL options and pack sellers this week. The obvious option was Cahill for this spot but apart from his goal he didn't really do much. I have taken a huge punt and gone with OTW Bailly. The United defender has looked impressive all season and another brilliant defensive performance from him in their 3-1 win over Mboro could see his OTW get a nice little boost.
Midfielders
Lorenzo Insigne - LW - OVR 84
I was wrong in predicting Insigne last week so why not try again this time. Once again, the Italian winger found the net twice with one being from the spot. This saw him claim MOTM with a 7.5 after Napoli managed to hold out to a 3-2 away win over Empoli.
Javier Pastore - CM - OVR 85
Pastore claimed MOTM with an 8/10 from L'equipe for his performance in PSG's narrow 2-1 win over Lyon. In such a big game an 8/10 is never going to be ignored. The Argentine picked up both the assists and I still can't believe that he is 27...
Casemiro - CM - OVR 83
There was a lack of gold performances this week and in fact I could have easily made a 23-man squad with purely Silver and Bronze items. That falls into the likes of Casemiro's hands though with the competition being lower. The Brazilian scored one of Madrid's two goals in their 2-1 win claiming MOTM with a 3 rating from Marca
Zlatko Junuzovic - CM - OVR 79
Junuzovic is one of the best all round midfielders you can get in terms of FUT without having to spend a ton and a cheap IF now looks to be on the way after he managed both a goal and assist in Bremens surprise 3-0 win over RBL.
Forwards
Romelu Lukaku - ST - OVR 84
At the rate Lukaku is going I would be surprised if Real Madrid don't come knocking. The Belgian powerhouse just can’t stop scoring and now leads the charts with 21 goals after bagging another two alongside an assist in Everton’s 4-0 win over Hull
Anthony Modeste - ST - OVR 82
Modeste has been one of the stars in the Bundesliga this season and has come from nowhere. The 28-year-old striker added another three to his tally against Hertha to take him to an impressive 22.
Alejandro Gomez - ST - OVR 81
Gomez is a similar story to Modeste in the sense that he is having an outbreak season from nowhere. Once again, he helped Atlanta to some points after being involved in all their goals. Two of his own alongside an assist is what he managed in their 3-0 win over Pescara.
Substitutes
Craig Dawson - RB - OVR 67
West Brom continued their impressive home form with a 3-1 win over the struggling Arsenal who look a different side with manager and star player troubles. WBA took advantage well though and with their RB, Dawson getting his name on the scoresheet twice I am sure we will see him included in TOTW.
Blerim Dzemaili - CM - OVR 74
The first of three players potentially making the switch from a silver to a gold item is Dzemaili. The Swiss midfielder found the net twice for Bologna in their 4-1 home win over Chievo.
Barry McNamee - CM - OVR 60
We saw a rather random Irish IF in Corcoran last week, presumably for st Patrick’s day but either way random to say the least. McNamee would be more expected though after the midfielder scored three times in Derry's 4-0 home win.
Adem Buyuk - ST - OVR 72
The likelihood is that there will not be this many silver and bronze players but I would rather increase my score than include players that am pulling out the sky and thus I have opted for Buyuk who scored a hat trick during Kasimpasa's 3-2 win.
Kylian Mbappe Lottin - ST - OVR 71
Mbappe is slowly becoming one of the most hyped youngsters around and with 18 goals in 18 starts for Monaco this season it's no wonder. He scored another two this weekend as Monaco managed a 3-0 away win over Caen
Diego Rolan - ST - OVR 78
Rolan scored twice for Bordeaux in their convincing 5-1 home win over Montpellier. His performance saw him claim 8/10 from L'equipe which as we have seen time and time again in the past is usually enough to get you in.
Ignacio Scocco - ST - OVR 72
Thankfully Scocco already has an IF and thus would be gold should he make the side again this week. This helps the selection process with the amount of silver and bronze players performing to a high standard and increases his chances massively. The Argentine scored all three N.O.B goals in their 3-0 home win over Velez.
Reserves
Sean McConville - LM - OVR 61
Despite this game being played on a Tuesday it really would be unfair if Accrington were not to receive an IF. McConville is the best choice by far after he scored two and assisted another three in their 5-0 win however their LB, Pearson also scored two and is in with a shout. From LM to be involved in five goals is quite something though.
Kamil Wilczek - ST - OVR 72
I think it's safe to say that Brondby are going to come second this season, after another win this weekend they are 13 points above third but still 12 behind first. Wilczek was vital for them in the 3-2-win scoring all their goals.
Nabil Ghilas - ST - OVR 72
Ghilas was heavily involved in a 4-3 thriller where his side came out on top after the Algerian managed to bag himself a hat trick. Claiming multiple headlines in a high scoring game should stand out.
Federico Dionisi - ST - OVR 73
There were a literal ton of top performances from Silver and bronze players this week which would have resulted in me struggling to select the 7 substitutes let alone trying to wriggle that down to five. Dionisi is one of the many players to score three goals which usually would make him a certainty but who really knows this week it comes down to pot luck.
Cheick Diarra - ST - OVR 68
Tours jumped out of the relegation positions in style winning 4-0 away to Valenciennes. Their striker was the main man behind the performance scoring three of the four goals and thus takes home the match ball"

With promotion and relegation coming at the end of each season, FIFA gamers can expect different players and teams even without the introduction of new leagues by EA. With every title update, new fan bases will see their teams rise into FIFA’s library and either appear in the game for the first time or make a triumphant return. 
Past examples of teams rising from out-of-depths into the game include Real Oviedo, Grimsby Town, Luton Town, and of course Rangers. But in FIFA 18, there are two clubs that could be on your radar for a possible deep Career Mode run: Venezia FC and Parma Calcio 1913.
These Italian sides were once more successful clubs who both had runs in Italy's top division in years past. After recent financial issues within the past decade, they both plummeted down the country’s pyramid, all the way to Serie D, Italy’s fourth division. Now, under proper leadership,, both clubs have fought their ways back and are ready to make a splash in Italian football in Serie B, ""Calcio B"" in FIFA.
Parma in particular won eight trophies during the 90s and early 2000s, featuring the likes of Gianluigi Buffon, Hernan Crespo, Fabio Cannavaro, and many others. Now you'll have the opportunity to potentially return them all the way back to European football. 
Players on their current roster who have previously been in FIFA include Gianni Munari, Matteo Scozzarella, Valerio Di Cesare and Luigi Alberto Scaglia.
The second Serie B side worth your consideration in FIFA 18 is Venezia FC. Not unlike Parma, Venezia was a respectable side in Italian football until financial turmoil struck. In late 2015, New York lawyer Joe Tacopina and a group of American investors purchased the club. Tacopina, who previously spent time on the boards of A.S. Roma and Bologna, was ready to turn a once beloved team into a winning side once again. 
Current players that were formerly in past FIFA games include Maurizio Domizzi, Giuseppe Marco Zampano, Simone Bentivoglio, Nicola Ferrari, and Alexandre Pazos Geijo. 
Much like Parma, Venezia is a club mostly full of more experienced players, so igniting the team with some youth may be the best way to go about conducting your career mode.

Whichever club you choose, you'll be given an interesting and immersive franchise to be a part of. It's both a perfect challenge and story that can keep a more diligent Career Mode fanatic engaged for weeks. With FIFA 18 set to release in but a few months, football gamers have some time to do their research and think about what they might do in order to return these (or other) once proud franchises back to glory."

There's a lot of hubbub around FIFA Mobile today -- and let's wait and see what all EA does to sort it all out -- but there's some welcome news as well.
After initially being available only on Android OS for the previous 24 hours or so, EA was able to release the latest update to FM on both major mobile operating systems following its approval on the iOS App Store.
As addressed by FIFA Mobile Communications lead Marko Djordjević on the EA forums, a number of reported gameplay/in-game issues are now a thing of the past:

Gameplay


Fixed the issue with first-time shots always going to the center of the net


Fixed the issue where the user is not able to sprint after a skill move if the sprint button was pressed too quickly


Fixed the issue where players would accelerate slowly sometimes


Changed how matches end.


Allow players to perform free kicks and/or penalties even after the clock strikes 0:00.


Added extra time to perform an attempt on goal even after reaching 0:00 if the ball is in the air.


VS Attack


Fixed some issues with the display of feedback from your opponent when waiting for them to finish


Fixed some issues with the display of the score in the summary screen being incorrect


Addressed issues around matchmaking and instant failures when loading into VS Attack


General


Fixed many crash bugs


Market: removed the “confirm sell” popup and added in group separators (, in 10,000) when typing in prices in the Market


Made the display of OVR consistent and fair across all screens and modes. Note that this can result in the display OVR decreasing by 1 in some screens so that it matches the correct calculation



The issue regarding being able to potentially complete an attempt on goal even after the clock's reached 0:00 is a welcome one to say the least.
Have you installed v. 6.1 yet? Any observations/thoughts (not related to Ultimate TOTS)?"

The Gullit Gang may not be quite as exclusive as it used to be, but a pair of slick new orange iMOTMs featuring 80+ across all face item stats is certainly a decent way to start the weekend.
Just following the formerly-known-as-EAFC-now Ultimate TOTS, the FUT 17 production staff churned out six extra packable special cards for TOTS' grand finale. Arturo Vidal's best in FIFA 17 so-far highlights the group along with a pair of Real Madrid CF standouts.
Bayern Munich's Joshua Kimmich called Leon Goretzka the best player on the pitch against Australia, and for it the Schlake star gets his best item to this point as well.
With another week of Confederation Cup action and more international competitions (like the Gold Cup) just on the horizon, expect more International Men of the Match arriving in-game in the not too distant future."

                        Not quite what we have become accustomed to but with Ramos, Payet, Insigne and Icardi featuring it's far from weak.
                    

Last week’s score: 13/23
Formation - 3-4-1-2 - Squad link: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/5153276/

Goalkeeper
German Lux - GK - OVR 77
Barcelona lost their top spot courtesy of a 2-1 defeat to Deportivo. Although Lux didn't really have that much to do in my eyes Marca still gave him MOTM with 3's for his four saves. Due to it being a Barcelona defeat I can't look past a Deportivo IF and Lux appears to be the man. 
Defenders
Sergio Ramos - CB - OVR 89
We start the defenders off with a punt in Ramos. There were only a handful of big names that realistically have a chance for this side and Ramos is one of those after his goal helped to put Madrid back to the top on the table with a narrow 2-1 win over Betis
Loic Perrin - CB - OVR 82
Even though Perrin didn't keep a clean sheet, nor did St Etienne win I would be very surprised if the defender didn't make EA's cut. Perrin claimed both a goal and assist for the French outlet as they managed a 2-2 home draw against Metz which saw him claim an 8/10 from L'equipe
Christophe Jallet - RB - OVR 79
Continuing the theme of Ligue 1 defenders with both a goal and assist, Jallet managed the exact same feat. The difference being that Jallet also managed to keep a clean sheet though. Once again, an 8 was received and although Depay scored the same for his brace with him featuring in week 24 I can see the defender being given preference.
Midfielders
Lorenzo Insigne - LW - OVR 84
Other than from Inter Milan it was difficult to select players from Serie A to feature in the side. Due to that and the fact that he would now be 87 rated I have taken the punt on Insigne. The Napoli winger scored two of their three goals, one being from the spot, as they managed a 3-0 home win over Crotone.
Ever Banega - CAM - OVR 84
The first of two Inter players to make the cut from their simply ridiculous 7-1 win at home to Crotone is Banega. The Argentine midfielder was involved in an impressive five of those goals with three of his own and two assists to go alongside that. He ended up picking up MOTM with a massive 9/10 scored from Gazzetta which is something you see maybe two or three times a season.
Alan Dzagoev - CM - OVR 81
CSKA recorded a comfortable 4-0 home win of which both Dzagoev and Ionov stood out in. Seeing as Dzagoev played in a deeper goal and was involved in three goals instead of two I have opted for the CM. With a goal and two assists it saw him pick up an 8.5 match rating which with the lack of BPL really should be enough to get in.
Emre Can - CM - OVR 80
Considering there was just the four BPL games playing and that Liverpool were the only big side to win from that selection of games I can see them picking up an IF. Can is the best possible player from that after he scored one of their two goals in a 2-1 win over Burnley.
Dimitri Payet - LM - OVR 86
With EA showing clear bias to the upper-class players the last couple of months I am taking what can be classed as a punt on Payet. The French midfielder was not MOTM in his match nor was he featured in Ligue 1's TOTW however with two assists and a 7 to his name alongside his FIFA rating and OTW item I feel as though EA are going to take this.
Forwards
Mauro Icardi - ST - OVR 84
As I stated with Banega a 9/10 is a very rare score to receive but Inter had two players reaching that mark which is something I have never seen before in Italy. It was another Argentine in Icardi who managed it after he also scored three goals in the 7-1 hammering. No assists for Icardi however it was the first three goals which he scored.
Bas Dost  - ST - OVR 80
Although Dost was severely helped by the fact Tondela seemed to enjoy giving penalties away the fact the Dutchman scored four in total makes him a certainty for this week’s side. The first two he scored came from open play before the third and fourth both came from the spot. He had another chance to make it five, funnily enough once again via a penalty but it wasn't to be with the third being missed. He claimed a huge 9/10 from his performance making him 100% for this side.
Substitutes
Felix Wiedwald - GK - OVR 76
This week’s German player of the week was Werder Bremen's keeper, Wiedwald. The stopper made a total of six saves in their 1-1 away draw with Leverkusen but it was the last-minute penalty save to do so which gave him the plaudits. I personally don't understand why a CB would be given a penalty to win the match but still.
Sead Kolasinac - LB - OVR 77
Not many Bundesliga options to choose from this week however there will inevitably be a couple at the very least. Kolasinac has a chance of being one of those players after he picked up a 1.5 from Kicker for his assist in Schalke's 3-0 home win
Juan Fernando Quintero - CM - OVR 79
It's safe to say that Quintero has not quite reached the level people expecting of him while playing his trade over at Porto. Now that he is back in his home country of Colombia player for Medellin he has started to impress again and at just 23 maybe there is still a bright future ahead for him. He scored twice and assisted another on Friday to help his side to a 4-1 win.
Luri Medeiros - RW - OVR 77
Abola seemed quite generous in their marks given this week with multiple 8's being handed out from which previously had been quite difficult to achieve. One player who deserved it was Medeiros though after he was involved in all three Boavista goals with two of his own alongside an assist for Bulos to confirm the 3-0 win.
Josef Alexander Martinez - ST - OVR 72
There is some debate surrounding the matter of if Atlanta can pick up IF's and that ultimately will decide if Martinez gets in or not. The striker scored three goals in their convincing 6-1 away win. If he is unavailable for the IF his replacement in my eyes will be David Villa.
Nicolai Jorgensen - ST - OVR 78
After suffering just their second loss of the season to Sparta Rotterdam Feyenoord bounced back with an impressive 5-2 win over AZ. Jorgensen was a part of all five of those goals with three of his own with two assists. He picked up player of the week in Holland for doing so with a huge 9/10
Oumar Niasse - ST - OVR 77
With just the four BPL games going ahead this weekend due to the FA Cup matches being played I expect Niasse to get the nod simply for the fact of having BPL players involved, despite the fact he plays for a lower side. He scored both Hull goals as they picked up a vital three points with a 2-1 home win over Swansea.
Reserves
[Josh Wright] (http://www.futhead.com/17/players/14934/josh-wright/) - CDM - OVR 64
    There have been some controversial ELL players to feature in recent weeks with unpredictable being taken to a whole new level. Wright for me shouldn't get in the side seeing as all three of his goals were from the spot but a hat trick is still a hat trick and thus I can't ignore the Gillingham midfielder.
Joshua King - CAM - OVR 72
King has been scoring a lot recently since Bournemouth gave him a more attacking role and although he was moved back to CAM for their game against WH he sure did deliver. The Norwegian scored all three of their goals in the 3-2 home win and although he also missed a penalty the fact that he scored three means he won’t be missing out.
Medy Elito - ST - OVR 62
The second ELL player to make the cut is Cambridge striker, Elito. The 26-year-old came off the bench to score three goals, two of which came from the spot in their 3-0 away win at Carlisle.
Gerard Badia - ST - OVR 69
With golds now seemingly continuing to get the preference week in week out the reserves section pretty much picks itself nine times out of ten. Badia falls into that category after finding the net three times for Gliwice in their 4-3 away win.
Felipe Mora - ST - OVR 72
Yet another hat trick now, this time from over in Chile as Mora managed to score three in Universidad's 3-0 away win. Straight forward selection really."

""What kind of a goalkeeper is the one who is not tormented by the goal he has allowed? He must be tormented! And if he is calm, that means the end. No matter what he had in the past, he has no future.""
— Lev Yashin
It's always exciting to see new legend additions to FIFA Ultimate Team, especially now that FUT Icons, what the former Legends are now known as, will be on both Xbox and PS4. The idea of Ronaldo Nazário, Diego Maradona, and Thierry Henry gracing our screens on the pitch yet again is exciting for most. But there is one new FUT Icon that may leave some fans curious: Soviet Union goalkeeping legend, Lev Yashin.
Yashin was a former Soviet goalkeeper who played professional football for 20 years with Dynamo Moscow and the Soviet national team. The keeper began his career in 1950 but wouldn't be recognized for his budding brilliance until 1953. During a three-year stint with the reserve team from 1950-1953, Yashin even moonlit playing professional hockey as a goalkeeper for the Dynamo hockey team.
From 1950-1970, Yashin was a genuine one-club man. With Dynamo, the goalkeeper went on to win five USSR football championships and three USSR Cups. He'd rack up more than 325 total appearances for the oldest Russian football club.
After a valiant effort (though somewhat marred by his own inconsistant play) in the 1962 World Cup where the Soviet Union lost to Chile in the quarterfinals, Yashin would be honored in 1963 with football's highest individual prize, the Ballon d'Or, becoming the first goalkeeper to ever win the award. He remains the only one to achieve the honor even today.
Following a lengthy front office career with Dynamo, Yashin passed away after a battle with cancer and was given a state funeral as a Merited Master of Sport of the USSR. It's safe to say he'll go down as one of if not the very best in Russian football history.
To visualize Yashin is to really know and appreciate what he brought to the game. As will become synomous with him in FIFA 18, Yashin often donned a brick-colored cloth hat, even during matches. Years after the hat had worn out, Yashin would often still put his former headgear on the ground next to the goalposts before he played. 
In true old school fashion, Yashin once attributed his secret to saving penalties as ""hav[ing] a smoke to calm your nerves, then toss[ing] back a strong drink to tone your muscles."" They don't make them like Yashin anymore.
Before FUT 18, check out what Yashin brought to the pitch. Expect to see his famous cloth hat early and often throughout 2018-19 Weekend Leagues:

Market Overview
Oh man. Arguably the two most important weeks in the Ones to Watch market have begun! Huge expectations for a January batch of OTW items, coupled with a special OTW SBC we saw last year, have players scrambling to pick up these dynamic items. 
So, naturally, and expectally, OTW player prices have shot up! Of course, the overall FUT market is also climbing up, so the OTW market is not alone in positive returns; however, massive weekly returns headline this week, but there’s plenty to talk about  to make sure everyone stays informed. 
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data that I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:   We are still really big on examining the largest high/low differences because those reflect the hype potential of an item, as well as gives you a feel for some good trading options. That being said, players like Ederson, Alvaro Morata and Keita Balde are examples of players who could be ideal trade tools for you.
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take:  Its not that often that the lower tier players have higher volatility than the elites! If you are someone who enjoys the high volatility and risk/reward that comes with that Mohammed Salah or Bruma might be your man, but if you’re a more cautious trader Alexandre Lacazette and Andriy Yarmolenko are better options. 

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Looking at the numbers this week, it seems a lot of the middle to high end players are following the market accordingly (betas close to zero). That being said the likes of Douglas Costa, Romelu Lukaku and Nelson Semedo have potential to swing massively up or down depending on if the market continues to climb.
TOTW Shout
Another solid week for real life performances by Ones to Watch items. This week the high profile Neymar destroyed Dijon FC to pick up his 95 rated item, while Franck Kessie snagged two goals, leading AC Milan to a win and a upgrade for himself. 
In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner -  Franck Kessie (AC Milan) 
More than half of the OTW items have enormous weekly returns and we have strayed away from picking upgraded players recently, but a 90% return from Franck Kessie has him as this week's biggest winner. The Ivorian put in a class performance, which many people had been expecting for a while, but there are other interesting facets to cover. 
Doing our diligence of looking over some weekly stats, a massive volatility (~8,500) and high beta (1.24) reflect the midfield man’s huge hype potential and subsequent price swing. Further digging down there, hopefully you sold into the hype when he was higher than 40k because as the week dragged on, and even after he received his infom, Kessie’s price dropped to around 30k. The preceding situation follows a trend of upgraded OTW items, so if you didn’t learn before make sure to not repeat your mistake later. 
Our final insight on Kessie is that he is one of the better options to pick up as a OTW SBC investment since there is a high supply of him, and at 81 rated he will work well if there is a high SBC rating requirement.
Big Loser- Leonardo Bonucci (AC Milan)
From one AC Milan star to another, this week’s biggest loser is Leonardo Bonucci. Although the ex-Juventus defender picked up a TOTY (which is a beast), his disastrous weekly return of -27.7% puts him in our hot seat. 
Looking at the stats, Bonucci sports a relatively low volatility (~3,700) but a high beta (1.74). To explain the low volatility, one can look to his price trend of the week which was a steady drop as people finally sold off their TOTY investment for a loss. But, as the sell off began it drove Bonucci down below his pre-TOTY price, which has him poised for a big price swing if he can put in an inform performance; thereby explaining his high beta. 

At the moment, Bonucci is at an all-time low. This presents an interesting situation for investors: do you pick him up hoping for an inform? Or stay clear and watch his price plummet around Lunar New Year? The ball is in your court…
Recap & outlook
Bringing the article to a close, the week post-TOTY has seen the general market climb up, but the OTW sector has exploded as investors look to the next big promotion in early February. Prices should continue to climb and at least stay stable, but monitor real life transfers as the OTW SBC hype is tied directly to the profile of those January deals. Some interesting final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Prices have shot up, but there are still chances to pick up players on open bid, just be sure to flip them quick as volatility is high.   

-- OTW investors: People have definitely started to invest, so the best tip we can give you is to sell into the hype next week if you’re looking for guaranteed profit! (Buying now for investments is risky).
Let us know how hyped you are for an OTW SBC below! As always make sure to check out our Path to Glory update!

Just ahead of FUT 18 Champions Cup in Barcelona, EA announced in a blog post that a few more changes to Weekend League are coming along with the latest title update. 
Tyler Blair, a senior game designer for Ultimate Team, explains the changes and provides some additional context to some of the title update changes. Specifically, kit selection. 
The most noteworthy change to Weekend League is that players will automatically qualify for the next Weekend League when they reach Silver 2, not Gold 3. Blair lends some insight into the thought process behind the change:

When we added qualification to the prizes at Gold 3 and above, we did so with the intent of making continued participation in the Weekend League easier. We looked at the effects of this change and found that it encouraged some players to play more games per weekend, which was not our intent.
To reach Gold 3, it takes 18 wins and data shows that a big group of players stop playing when they get there. It also shows that it takes most players approximately 31 games to achieve this rank. We understand the rewards are a big driver as to why people try to get as many wins as possible, but the disproportionate population of players who stop at this line signals an opportunity for improvement. So, with that in mind we're making a change at the start of February.

Blair also thoroughly explains the new Pre-Match selection screen in greater detail, quelling concerns and confusion that arose in the community with the accountment of Patch 6.

The highly anticipated first day of the FUT Champions Cup, held in Barcelona, was marred by technical difficulties that postponed the start of the tournament and eventually delayed the completion of the opening rounds proceedings through the rest of the day. The original schedule intended for the esports players to complete all seven rounds of the new opening rounds format by the end of today. Instead, they were only able to complete two.
As a result, no players were either confirmed for the knockout round or eliminated from the competition. However, despite the difficulties, there was plenty of early action to follow for the avid competitive FIFA fan. The favorites made their mark, and some underdogs emerged as well. One of the more jarring results of the day saw last year's FIWC Champion Spencer 'Unilad Gorilla' Ealing losing 8-2 on aggregate to FUT Champions 17 regular FC Schalke's Tim Latka.
In general, the German FIFA standouts competing in the tournament had a good day at the office. Coming in as the No. 38 seed in the Xbox One division, relative newcomer Sakul970611 ended the day with three wins to his name. Apart from Latka's impressive win over Gorilla, he finished with a solid record 2-0 record. Wolfburg's Benedikt 'SaLz0r' Saltzer, and Schalke's Playstation 4 competitor Lukas 'idealz7x' Schmandt both finished with two wins as well.
FIWC runner-up Kai 'Deto' Wollin played one of the more engaging matches of the day, against FUT Champions Madrid Regional Champion Daniele 'IcePrinsipe' Paolucci, with the latter emerging as the victor. RB Leipzig's Cihan Yasarlar, formerly of Schalke, finished as the runner-up at the FUT Champions Paris Regional last February and emerged as a somewhat dark horse candidate today, winning against Wolfsburg's Timo 'iTimoX' Siep, one of other notable names coming into the competition.
A pair of Hashtag United competitors both finished the day with a .500 record, one on each console. New signing 'Hashtag Agge' Rosenmeier started off the day failing to close out in a losing effort but rebounded well in his second match, while 'Hashtag Harry' Hesketh won his first match but lost a tough one to AS Roma's Sam 'Poacher' Carmody. Hashtag's other most recent signing, 'Hashtag Ryan' Pessoa, ultimately led the trio, fishing with two wins on a strong early showing.
Tomorrow's festivities should kick-off at 6 a.m. ET, 12 p.m. local time (11 a.m. UK), with Round 3 of the Group Stage. The event can be streamed on both the EA SPORTS FIFA Twitch and Youtube channels. Extended coverage and behind-the-scenes action can be found on EA's Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat channels."

After an unfortunate start to the weekend, the second day of the Barcelona FUT Champions Cup brought a lot more action and a lot more stability to the proceedings. The usual broadcast crew of Spencer 'Spencer FC' Owen, Chu 'ChuBoi' Morah, and former USMNT defender Jimmy Conrad were also more prominent on the streaming side of things as we collectively took in the last five rounds of the Group Stage. And with those rounds came a number of surprises.
The field was narrowed down to 32 players on each console, and the biggest storylines of today involved not only some surprise candidates, but also shock eliminations. Corentin 'Vitality Rocky' Chevrey, the FIFA Ultimate Team Championship Series champion, was knocked out in the last round of the Group Stage. Another big name to drop today with AFC Ajax's Dani Hagebeuk, who had a decent FIFA Interactive World Cup campaign but failed to make a mark in Barcelona. Sean 'Dragon' Allen, a regular in the competitive circuit, also failed to make it to the Knockout Stage.
Among the surprise candidates were relative newcomer Lukas 'Sakul' Vanderheide, who went undefeated through seven rounds with a dominant showing, and FC Basel's Tim 'TheStrxngeR' Katnawatos, who finished with a 6-1 record with 50 goals, 29 goals against, and a 7.14 goal ratio. Hashtag United's 'Hashtag Ryan' Pessoa and RB Leipzig's Cihan Yasarlar both confirmed their early dark horse statuses with a strong group stage campaign. Pessoa ended with a 6-1 record, and beat Kurt Fenech, who was the first to qualify for the Knockout Stage today.
Kurt and Schalke's Tim Latka fourth round showdown, to become the first player to confirm their entrance into Knockout Stage, may have been the most exciting two-leg affair of the day; the match ended 5-3 with Kurt pulling ahead right at the death. Kurt became the first to a 4-0 record but finished his last three matches with only win.
Former Hashtag United player Tassal 'FaZe Tass' Rushan completed the biggest comeback of the night after finishing the first leg with a 5-1 deficit. He scored six goals and conceded one in the second leg to shock everyone.
""I'm not usually the comeback type, I never do stuff like that,"" Tass said afterwards. "" I'm not really gonna give credit to myself; I can only imagine how he feels. He was up 6-1.""
Frontrunner Shaun 'xShellzz' Springette was in big trouble early on today, with a 1-3 record, but racked up an impressive three wins in a row to squeak out an entry into the next round at the last minute.
The Knockout Round, which seeds into a single-elimination bracket based on their win-loss record from the Group Stage, will kick off tomorrow at 6 a.m. ET, 12 p.m. local time, and 11 a.m. UK time. At the end of the knockouts, only two players will remain, one from Xbox One and one from Playstation, and they will go on to play each other in the cross-console Grand Final. In the Grand Final, one game will be played on each console and the player with the higher aggregate score will be declared the champion and get to take home 22,000 dollars.
The event can be streamed on both the EA SPORTS FIFA Twitch and YouTube channels. Extended coverage and behind-the-scenes action can be found on EA's Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat channels."

Looking at the current week's selections, EA actually selcted some solid matchups that aren't as outlandish as they were in prior weeks. That being said, they were still a little quirky so make sure to always watch your profit and don't get greedy. This week, there are plenty of derbies and high profile clashes to consider, so stay smart and be patient to get the best deals. 
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Espanyol vs Barcelona
Match Info:  A Catalan derby graces the number one spot this week as a high flying Barcelona take on a middling Espanyol side. If EA forgo the rivalry in case of a more table focused matchup in Atletico Madrid versus Valencia, make sure to hedge a little there too! Non-rare Spanish players are the way to go here, and selling into hype or holding could both yield tidy profit.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


San Lorenzo vs Boca Juniors
Match Info:  Although it's not a traditional derby, we turn our attention to Argentina where the top two teams square off. San Lorenzo are in better form, but this should still make for a great matchup. This might just be the right amount of random for EA, so look to the non-rare golds. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 rated


Player Requirement: 2 to 3 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Borussia M'gladbach vs RB Leipzig
Match Info:  After the Bundesliga’s snub from this week’s Marquee Matchups, a fixture between two teams fighting  for a UCL spot should be on EA’s radar. Both teams are currently on the same points, so this hard fought fixture is another game to catch if you can. German league players are always good investments regardless, but stick to as close to discard price as possible.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Bologna vs Fiorentina
Match Info:  Turning to Italy, the Derby dell'Appennino headlines the fixtures of their match week, and the two teams from neighboring regions always put on a show when squaring off. There aren’t many other good shouts in Serie A, so this one should be an EA frontrunner. Plenty of non-rare options to go around here, but make sure to diversify too!
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there tends to be some variance each week, let's take a look at some more outside the box picks that could make their way in:
Liverpool vs Tottenham
Match Info: We always say you can’t ignore the PL when it comes to SBCs like this, so this week we made our selection based on two teams fighting for a top four spot. Two teams in great form (even though Liverpool lost to Swansea LOL). If EA want to go down the derby route, West Ham host Crystal Palace; however, recently they’ve thrown that to the wind… Burnley versus Man U…
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Olympiakos vs AEK Athens
Match Info: Yes, we’re fancy and use the “k”, but regardless the matchup between the number one and three side should not be overlooked. It is the definition of a sleeper pick as its generated very little hype, but it checks all of EA’s boxes (random and semi-important). If you can watch it, tune in because the Greek League is nuts. But, if not, settle for the non-rare golds.   

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Monaco vs Lyon
Match Info: It seems like Monaco is a staple in these lists, but we’d say it’s better to be safe than sorry. Ligue 1 always gets super expensive when included in a Marquee Matchup, so if it makes the cut there is some serious profit here. If not you can always hold until the next inclusion or sell overnight.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Al-Ittihad vs. Al-Ahli
Match Info: The Jeddah Derby of Saudi Arabia rounds out our sleeper picks from this week. Note that the Saudi League has experienced it fair share of snubs in the past, yet with little to no hype around this you can get players cheap. Non-rares are great for MM investing or can be sold overnight due to the league SBC. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 68 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
Two weeks in a row!! We’ll add an exclamation point for however many weeks we can keep the streak going.
Leeds vs Cardiff
Investing Strategies
It's that time. Remember to take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team on how to possibly make a few coins with would-be Marquee Matchups:

-- Prioritize investing in players who are members of the two teams featured in a specific Marquee Matchup (the higher rated, the better).
-- Non-Rare cards usually have a higher return on investment.
-- Certain positions such as LB/RB, CMs and STs are generally more profitable."

The rumors are true.
Perhaps the most OP FIFA 18 Ultimate Team Throwback Thursday Squad Building Challenges are here. ""The Black Spider"", Lev Yashin (and his famous hat!), Netherlands star Marco Van Basten, German juggernaut Lothar Matthäus, and the one, the only, Ronaldinho, just one day after announcing his retirement, all have untradeable yielding SBCs, temporarily available loan editions, and are packable from now until the end of FUT 18.
The early reviews seem positive: Yashin and Van Basten are both relatively affordable, as far as untradeable item yielding SBCs go. Ronaldinho and Matthäus, perhaps appropriately, won't come easily.
If you've already unlocked one of these monster player items, let us know and share your reviews here on Futhead."

It's almost do or die time for FIFA Mobile's Team of the Year Event and promotion.
In the second of two weeks, those who've been grinding (and, well spending) with a high-end Team of the Year starter target in mind have to figure out what their end game is: chase the likes of a David De Gea or a Lionel Messi, or settle for maybe a combination of lesser rated starters from the same positional group.
To try and aid in that process, after previously concluding that DDG is probably a luxury item not necessary for many, we decided to take a look at his fellow countryman, Real Madrid's indispensable Sergio Ramos.
With yet another uncontroversial TOTY inclusion, Ramos has all the makings of one of if not the best central defenders in the game. So how does he measure up against the best centerbacks in FIFA Mobile?
In-Game Stats
As far as CBs go, Ramos' numbers are top 1%, there's no denying that:"

TOTW 19 is an absolute belter and with big name performances across the weekend, it made finding the superstar additions nice and easy for our predictions guru. But outside of those top rated IFs, we have nine players missed from a jam packed TOTW 19. 
Alfie Mawson – CB – Swansea
In the Monday night Premier League fixture rock bottom Swansea were against a Liverpool side purring with confidence and attacking verve. But in typical Liverpool fashion they toiled where no one expected them to, and Swansea ended up as beneficiaries grabbing an important 1-0 win. Alfie Mawson scored the goal and also contributed 7 clearances towards the defensive shut out. 

Aaron's View: I almost certainly would have included Mawson had I have waited until the end of Monday’s games to publish.
Gaston Ramirez – CAM – Sampdoria
Not to do Gaston Ramirez a disservice for his three assists in Sampdoria’s 3-1 against Fiorentina, but I think we were all assuming Quagliarella would make TOTW 19 for being on the end of each of those assists. Hattricks are normally golden tickets as far as TOTW inclusions go and with Quagliarella’s last IF coming three weeks ago he looked a sure thing. But still, well done Gaston.
Aaron's View: I opted for the Quagliarella hat trick which with a three week gap I felt was sufficient. Turns out it wasn’t, and instead we have Ramirez who provided the assist for all three goals.
Luis Muriel – ST – Sevilla
After a rotten run of form spanning five winless matches Sevilla finally got three points on the board away to Espanyol on Saturday. And it was a comfortable win in the end with Sevilla notching three times including a late strike from Luis Muriel in the 92nd minute. Muriel also grabbed an assist in this one to take him in to the TOTW. 

Aaron's View: The lack of a three star award from Marca put me off this one but a lack of La Liga options in general has seemingly helped the Sevilla forward for the TOTW.
Timo Horn – GK – FC Cologne
I said last week that if Cologne won against Hamburg things would get interesting at the foot of the Bundesliga, and interesting they got with a 2-0 win making it three on the bounce for a side which hadn’t won previously in sixteen. Timo Horn gets the nod here I assume for accumulated good form across these matches which included two clean sheets. Cologne are now just four points from safety. 
Aaron's View: Horn was actually in my prediction for quite some time. After digging into the game I discovered that Terrode was named the official MOTM and I removed Horn, which turned out to be a big mistake.
Jeroen Zoet – GK – PSV
PSV are generally in the TOTW mix for their array of attacking talents rather than goalkeepers but Jeroen Zoet makes it this week for a couple of crucial saves against Hercules in PSV’s 2-1 win. All the same this would’ve been a tough one to pick up prediction wise with very few clean sheets in PSV’s last 10 games to add to Zoet’s single match performance here. 
Aaron's View: Zoet received a decent match rating but with just four saves in a 2-1 game they were fully expected to win, this is pushing it for me.
Anderson Talisca – CAM – Besiktas
Besikats have struggled to keep pace at the top of the Turkish Super Lig in recent weeks and with all the sides above them winning this weekend their 2-1 win against Antalyaspor ended up being crucial. And it was their talismanic midfielder Talisca who scored both of those goals taking his tally in all competitions to nine. 
Aaron's View: There were multiple gold midfielders who picked up two goals this week and I got most of them correct but, I opted against Talisca for other Calcio A options.
Ryota Morioka– CAM – Waasland-Beveren
From the limited information I can get on this one it appears Ryota Morioka only grabbed a single assist in Waasland-Beveren’s 3-1 win against St Truiden but from the Futhead comments it seems he’s been their player of the season so far and fairly outstanding outside of the usual goals and assists trend the TOTW normally bases itself on. 
Aaron's View: Onto the random ones of the week now and although Waasland shocked won 3-1 a solitary assist for Morioka is still not enough for me.
Sean McConville – LM – Accrington Stanley
After a couple of defeats in a row Accrington Stanley have now won four games on the bounce propelling themselves to third in League 2. The latest of those wins was a hard fought 3-2 win against Port Vale where they were at one point 2-0 down before Billy Kee and Sean McConville (who scored twice) fired them to victory.
Aaron's View: McConville scored two of three Accrington goals in a narrow 3-2 win but from a non important league 2 game you very rarely see these performances noticed by EA.
Dario Vidosic – ST – Melbourne City
And finally, we cross the globe to Australia where Melbourne City took on Adelaide United in the A-League. And it was a bit of a one-sided affair to say the least with Melbourne running rampant in the final minutes of the match to turn a comfortable 2-0 win, in to a 5-0 rout. Dario Vidosic got in on the act himself with two goals in a minute only for the win to be increased further by Ross McCormack.
Aaron's View: It was a convincing win for Melbourne over Adelaide who managed to score five without reply. But the same applies as above in that you rarely see a striker with two goals making the cut unless they are from a big league or a vital match."

We were very close to a perfect week again last week, with the only upset being Lyon, who surprised 10-man PSG to win 2-1 thanks to a late Memphis Depay winner.
On to this week now, where we have games from Italy, Spain, France and Belgium to try and predict to unlock a special version of Valencia’s striker Rodrigo. With coins being the other rewards last week, it has now changed to XP, helping you level up your players a bit more easily. 

Valencia v Real Madrid
Third host fourth in what will be a very interesting game.
Real Madrid find themselves in the unusual position of being fourth in La Liga, and perhaps most surprisingly, are the same number of points behind Barcelona as they are ahead of the relegation zone. Although a,win in this game will see them remain fourth, they have a game in hand over their opponents and cutting the gap to two points. A 7-1 win last weekend saw both Bale and Ronaldo notch their fifth and sixth league goals this season, and also helped Real to their first league win in over a month. 
Valencia will be hoping to get back to winning ways after their first loss of the new year against lowly Las Palmas. However they will have to cope without both of their centre backs, who were sent off last week. They can take confidence that that was their first loss of the year, having drawn their first and then won four on the trot.
Games between these two are rarely dull, with the last time a game had fewer than three goals being in 2013. Two wins each and four draws in the last eight matches shows how even these sides are. I believe this match would be just as close if it wasn't for Valencia's suspensions. They do have a solid replacement in Garay, but whether their other replacement is able to cope with Ronaldo and Bale, who are starting to find good form once again, remains to be seen.
Game time: Saturday 27th January, 3:15 p.m. (BST)/ 10:15 a.m. (EST) 
My prediction: Real Madrid win

Standard Liege v Anderlecht
The game that I expect people to know the least about is a clash between two Belgian giants, though you may not know that by looking at the league table. Anderlecht are the most successful team in Belgium, with more league titles than all other current Pro League teams combined. However, this season hasn’t exactly gone to plan for the reigning champions, as they sit in 3rd, 11 points off the pace. Their three most recent losses - spread over their last 8 competitive games, have been against league leaders Club Brugge, second place Charleroi, and this weeks opponents Standard Liege who won this fixture 1-0 in December when they met in the Cup. They have won their last three games 1-0, which may be a good sign for them as they aim to try and narrow the gap to the teams above them, if they want to have a chance of retaining their league title.
Liege currently find themselves down in 8th place and closer to the relegation zone than their opponents. With just one win since November, they are in poor form and are in desperate need of a win to try and gain some confidence to try and bring some respect back to their season.
The past few games between these two have been very even, with two wins each over the last seven ties. I expect this one to be an away win, with Anderlecht’s current form seeing them through to a win.
Game time: Saturday 27th January, 5:00 p.m. (BST)/ 12:00 p.m. (EST) 
My prediction: Anderlecht win

AC Milan v Lazio
AC Milan would have been hoping that their big money signings in the summer would have had more of an impact on their league position, but so far it has been unsuccessful. They currently sit one place off the Europa League qualifier spot in 7th, and have six less points than this stage last season. They are starting to find some form though, with five wins from their last eight games making them appear to have turned things around over the short winter break as they aim to try and reach the Champions League spots after a five year absence. 
Lazio have one of the most in-form strikers in the world right now in Ciro Immobile. After flopping and not getting many chances at Dortmund and then Sevilla, the Italian is showing that he has found his form again, with seven goals in his last six games. However, he picked up a hamstring injury last weekend which forced him to miss their midweek win over Udinese. One of the many positives that Lazio can take from the past two games is that they are still capable of scoring without their top scorer. Five different players have found the back of the net in those two games, as they scored eight and conceded just one.
Games between these two tend to sway either way, but I feel that Lazio’s excellent goalscoring record of late will be too much for Milan to handle and they will take away the three points.
Game time: Sunday 28th January, 5:00 p.m. (BST)/ 12:00 p.m. (EST) 
My prediction: Lazio win

Marseille v Monaco
Monaco are definitely not the same side they were last season, having been unable to properly replace Mbappé, Silva, Bakayoko and Mendy who they lost in the summer. That being said, they are still in the chasing pack of three who are battling it out for the second automatic Champions League qualification spot. Back-to-back draws may have seen them stutter slightly as they dropped to 4th, but a solid 3-1 win will have returned some confidence to them ahead of this crucial game.
Marseille currently sit just one point above Monaco, and one behind Lyon, in the chasing pack. They are in fine form, winning five of their last six games by two goals or more each time and have conceded just one goal in those games.
Monaco have had the beating of Marseille in recent years, and you have to go back to May 2015 for the last time that Marseille won against their fellow south coast side. However, I can see that run coming to an end this weekend, with Marseille’s excellent attacking form and defensive solidity of late proving too much for Monaco, along with Monaco feeling a little more fatigued after a tough midweek cup tie against Lyon while Marseille rested the majority of their regular players for an easy 2-0 win over fourth-tier Epinal.
Game time: Sunday 28th January, 8:00 p.m. (BST)/ 3:00 p.m. (EST) 
My prediction: Marseille win

A couple of games could go either way, but that’s what I think will happen this weekend. If Rodrigo doesn't take your fancy, or you don't manage to collect four points, then you'll be able to trade in your left over points for XP this week, hopefully helping you boost your players to the next level.

So much for EA simply overriding the community vote with the FIFPro World XI or whatever else they wanted, eh?
The third and final reveal of the first ever EA SPORTS FIFA Team of the Year is here and with it we see one slight deviation from the on-paper leaders in the community ballot. Manchester United's Antonio Valencia, far and away the most conentious inclusion in our and others' ballots, couldn't survive his narrow lead -- remember, he had a plurality, not a majority.
Dani Alves, the controversial inclusion to the FIFPro Team of the Year back in FIFA 14 and FIFA 16, makes news once again, edging out the one-star weak foot possessing FUT favorite. Alves' worthiness is debatable in its own right -- as a rotation guy for both Juve and PSG (where he hasn't had quite the form he did with The Old Lady), he has far fewer matches than the other defender nominees. But his class and pedigree are undeniable. Those complaining about the overblown prospects of a so-called Premier-League-TOTY can't knock having some club/league diversity in the 11 as well.
The rest of the XI is perfectly in-line with the TOTY Community Vote, with three of the four named also in October's traditional World XI. Leonardo Bonucci's TOTY worthiness is as contentious as Alves' if we're being real, but after a snub a year ago, it feels nice he gets some due, even if he's struggled adjusting to his own respective new club. Sergio Ramos and Marcelo seem certainly to be in the TOTY mix until they call it a career. And David De Gea -- look, this Bayern/Manuel Neuer fan is saying it and so can you -- was the best healthy goalkeeper during the calendar year of 2017. Gigi Buffon's a legend, but let's not put guys in their twilight in just because they're hanging it up and had strong swan songs.
The goalkeepers and defenders, all five of them (versus the previous three midfielders and three attackers) are in packs 48 hours, not the previous 24 of the other two positional groups. That should mean we'll see the full Team of the Year in packs over the weekend.
Excited to get your hands on any of the defenders? Were you really holding out hope Antonio Valencia would survive EA's staff vote? Let us know in the comments below."

The. Hype. Is. Real.
FIFA 18's Team of the Year is finally, at long last here. But it wouldn't be EA without the prerequisite twists.
The major difference so far is only the attackers from last week's community/influencer/media/athete as well as EA staff votes have been revealed. The three at the top of FIFA 18's TOTY will be in packs from 15 January at 6 p.m. UK time (1 p.m. ET) until 16 January at the same time.
The second pivot would seem to be the length (and potentially even order) we'll be getting Team of the Year this year. In FIFA 17, the attackers were available for 48 hours (comprising the Monday and Tuesday of TOTY), while this years they'll only be available Monday. How that impacts the order of release or the total length of the full teams' release remains to be seen.
Finally, no Neymar. After Harry Kane carried our Futhead community-voted ballot (and seemed to have a solid enough lead amongst the rest of the influencers' votes), EA's staff vote either pushed Kane across the finish line or honored the spirit of the community vote, getting the Spurs/England star his first TOTY blue-and-black special item.
Perhaps no bigger controversy will be the decision to make cover star Cristiano Ronaldo a 99-overall while leaving Lionel Messi, who's clearly had the better 2017 calendar year than Ronnie, down at just 98. Leaving room for a 99 Messi TOTS and giving Ronaldo a hat tip for last year's Ballon d'Or? That's about all we can muster.
We'll have more tomorrow at 2 p.m. UK when ostensibly we'll find out the next domino in this year's promo."

Seems like over the past couple of weeks, EA have been tiptoeing that line of our sanity with their Marquee Matchup picks. However, as TOTY breathes a little life into the community, we have a new found excitement for our predictions! Even though the pack value has been lacking, receiving these Gold Packs still gives us hope for one of those blue flares.
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Valencia vs Real Madrid
Match Info: A clash between the third and fourth place teams in La Liga starts us off, and although it is not a proper derby, it still is a high profile tie. Both teams are fighting for their top four spots, an it's especially high stakes for Real Madrid who are trying to salvage their season. Plenty of good non-rares from both clubs .

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Anderlecht vs Liege
Match Info:  After last week, another Pro League matchup makes our list, yet this one is an even more established derby. Two very successful clubs in Belgium face off which could be a lifeline for EA who have a week of limited derbies.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 rated


Player Requirement: 2 to 3 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


AC Milan vs Lazio
Match Info:  EA threw in a slightly random matchup between Inter and Roma last week, so let's see if they continue the trend by selecting the city counterparts of this week's matchup. Calcio A usually has cheap investments, so finding some low risk items should be easy.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Rangers vs Aberdeen
Match Info:  Shifting our focus to Scotland, the SPL offers quite a few notable matchups in this cycle. Rangers and Aberdeen are our front-runners as its a notable derby in a week where they are slightly lacking. Stick to the silver non-rares here.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 68 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there tends to be some variance each week, let's take a look at some more outside the box picks that could make their way in:
Celtic vs Partick Thistle
Match Info: As stated above, Scotland has a couple rivalries this week. So, in order to cover the other basis Celtic play Thistle in a mid-week tie that could also sneak in to the SBC. We feel it's a little riskier so we shifted it to sleeper pick. Still could be good players to hedge against the other SPL match.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 68 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Marseille vs Monaco 
Match Info: Monaco has been getting a lot of love by EA recently; however, a big matchup between the teams from the south of France had to make the list. Although EA could very well pick a random Ligue 1 match, these two sides have the best chance while also sporting plenty of cheap investments.  

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Sporting vs Porto (Cup Final)
Match Info: So we get to the cup ties. EA are always finicky about these, but it is the Portuguese cup final between two huge rivals. If you pick up some non-rares here they will definitely find value either if this features or in some other SBC in the near future.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Chelsea vs Arsenal (Cup)
Match Info: The last sleeper is the big matchup between these two London sides. The first leg ended equal so there’s a lot to play for here. Would definitely NOT put all your eggs in this basket, yet its still an interesting shout. Non-rares from the BPL always hold value well.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
We nailed this one last week, so we’re finally feeling good about this segment.
Melbourne vs Sydney
Investing Strategies
It's that time. Remember to take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team on how to possible make a few coins with would-be Marquee Matchups:

-- Prioritize investing in players who are members of the two teams featuring in a specific Marquee Matchup (higher rated the better)
-- Non-Rare cards usually have a higher return on investment
-- Certain positions such as LB/RB, CMs and STs are generally more profitable"

It’s that time of the year again: 2 weeks after the generous Football Freeze promotion comes the FIFA Mobile Team of the Year! In an exciting deviation from the console TOTY, FIFA Mobile sees the release of all 55 shortlisted players as special TOTY items. All 44 reserve players are tradable, with the 11 starting players becoming tradable after the event has finished.
Starters 92 LW Cristiano Ronaldo, 90 ST Harry Kane, and 92 RW Lionel Messi headline the 15 Attackers, including a reserve 90 LW Neymar and the current best LF in game, 89 Eden Hazard. 
All reserve Attackers have received a +2 to +4 to their OVR and some nice boosts to their stats reflecting their selection as one of the top players in the 2017 calendar year. Check out Futhead’s new FIFA Mobile player database and comparison tool to see these insane cards at maxed level. 
Two interesting aspects to be noted: 89 CF Paulo Dybala -- who is listed as a midfielder on the TOTY shortlist -- as well the absence of Philippe Coutinho. Coutinho will instead be available as a midfielder at CAM flaunting his new club Barcelona’s colours.
How the FIFA Mobile TOTY Event works
Main Chapter
With the success of Football Freeze, EA have taken a similar approach to TOTY, with three different 2 stamina grindable event refreshing every 4 hours. You are only able to choose one event per cycle, either Attackers, Midfielders, or Defenders. Each cycle guarantees 4 Skill Boosts, 1,500 generic XP and 3,500 coins plus either an Attacker Point and 5 Skill Boosts, a Midfielder Point and 1,500 generic XP, or a Defender Point and 7,500 coins.
Position Chapters
In addition to the Main grindable Chapter, there are three Campaign style Chapters for the three positions categories. Starting with only Attackers unlocked, each Campaign uses respective TOTY points as entry costs, similar to how Freezing and Boiling points worked on the Football Freeze Snowflake.
The Attackers Chapter features TOTY starters Kane, Ronaldo, and Messi, as well as a large number of Skill Boost rewards. The main path through the Chapter rewards 5 Skill Boosts and 3 Bonus Points for every Attacker Point used to play a node, with a chance at any TOTY Attacker. Each TOTY starter has their own side path that rewards players with their TOTY item. At the node leading to each side path the requirements to play subsequent nodes increases. For Kane’s side path and onwards, one TOTY Attacker (starter or reserve) must be on your team, while Ronaldo requires two TOTY Attackers and Messi requires three.  Kane’s 90 ST item results in a lower total cost (78 Attacker Points) than Ronaldo’s 147 Attacker Points or Messi’s 190 Attacker Points. Side path nodes reward 8 Skill Boosts and 3 Bonus Points per Attacker Point cost. Additionally, four 2,500 Skill Boosts for 50 Attacker Points nodes are available, one at the end of each side path, and one at the end of the main path.
Midfielders and Defenders follow a similar pattern with reduced point costs due to their grindable events being unlocked later. Midfielders Chapter main path nodes reward 2,500 XP and 3 Bonus Points per Midfielder Point cost, with side paths rewarding 4,000 XP and 3 Bonus Points per Midfielder Point cost. There are also four lots of 1.25 million XP for 50 Midfielder Points available, one for each for the three Midfielder starters, and one at the end. Defenders Chapter main path nodes reward 12,500 coins and 3 Bonus Points per Defender Point cost, with side paths rewarding 20,000 coins and 3 Bonus Points per Defender Point cost. There are also six lots of 2.5 million coins for 50 Defender Points available, one each for the five Defender starters, and one at the end.
Bonus Chapter
The last Chapter is the Bonus Chapter, providing rewards for completing skill games within the Position Chapters and obtaining TOTY players. On offer in the first section are Bonus Points and Position Points for completing events within the Position Chapters. Completing 25 events across all three Position Chapters with a minimum of 5 in each, as well as obtaining a TOTY Attacker, Midfielder and Defender will reward you with 2.5 million coins. Collecting a TOTY Starter further rewards 1,000 Skill Boosts and a TOTY logo, 3 Starters yield 1 million XP and the TOTY trophy, and 5 Starters will earn you 5 million coins and a unique animated TOTY logo. Beyond these rewards come the first two truly end game players at 97 and 98 ratings respectively. These highly prized items are rumoured to be players who have featured in previous TOTYs (or maybe former Ballon d'Or winners?), namely two of the following:

Bold denotes players on this year’s TOTY shortlist
Italics denotes Icons
Plain denotes active players not on this year’s TOTY shortlist

Due to licensing, it is unlikely active players will be the Masters and with Paolo Maldini, Carles Puyol, Rio Ferdinand, and Ronaldinho already having Icons in FIFA Mobile, we could be seeing a 97 or 98 Thierry Henry, Andriy Shevchenko or Alessandro Nesta gracing the pitches of VS Attack. However they do not come cheap, with the 97 requiring a 110 OVR team with 7 TOTY starters, and the 98 requiring every TOTY starter and a 115 OVR.
Packs
Two 500,000 coin packs are available for Attackers, which should follow for Midfielders and Defenders. Additional packs can be purchased for 1,500 FP, with a bundle guaranteeing a TOTY player for 15,000 FP. There are also Bonus packs purchasable with Bonus points obtained through other packs and the Position/Bonus Chapters. These Bonus Packs will rotate every 24 hours.
FIFA Mobile TOTY Player Costs
TOTY starter costs vary by position and rating, with the lowest cost Defender requiring 50 Defender Points and Messi needing 190 Attacker Points.

With Starters being between 90-92 OVR, earning a 90 Starter without Packs or grinding the repeatable events is very achievable. The TOTY player requirements will require an investment in either packs, the market, or getting lucky from the Position Chapters.

Summary
Overall, TOTY allows for minimal effort to earn a 90 OVR Player, while more effort and packs could land you multiple TOTY starters along with lots of Skill Boosts, XP and coins to boost your Starting XI. The release of all 55 TOTY shortlisted players also means at least one 82+ player will be released in every position, providing something for everyone to improve their squads."

Market Overview
FUTmas hit the market hard with some holiday spirit this past week. Pack promos and a variety of Squad Builder Challenges has given the community some quality content; however, perhaps more importantly, all the buzz has lead to a market crash bigger than Black Friday. A huge supply of items has driven prices down across the board, but it is interesting to note that as you're reading this, the market is stabilizing somewhat. 
Getting specific with the Path to Glory market, we saw similar trends as the rest of the FUT market. Noticeably, the high end players have seen their prices dip, while the lower value players have seen a sharp uptick. This reflects the hype around the possible need for them in SBC, but as always will be fascinating to watch how trends develop.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  Looking at the figures above, the most interesting trend we've seen over the week is that players like Gabriel Jesus and Marcus Rashford are around their lows now, while items like Danny Welbeck and William Carvalho are near their highs.
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take:  Plenty of high volatility figures this week but Giuliano and Javier Pastore really stand out. They have large figures relative to their price and good be good looks to flip.

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of a card to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: This week saw some polar figures in the beta section. Focusing on the big figures, the two LMs Emil Forsberg and Dmitri Payet could be interesting cases of big swings in if the market rebounds, maybe in different directions though.
TOTW Shout 
There were a couple figures who warrant a longshot look into the TOTW. Premier League midfielders, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Bakayoko both  bagged a in fixtures over the week 
Big Winner- Tiémoué Bakayoko (Chelsea)
There was some big gainers at the PTG market this week, yet Weekend League favorite Bakayoko gets the nod due to his massive price increase and interesting situation. As  mentioned above, the Frenchman notched a goal in a midweek fixture and of course the market went mental for the Weekend League meta player. 
Getting into some stats, the ex-Monaco player spots a high volatility figure (~11000), while sporting a high negative beta (-0.77). The volatility lends to the massive hype’s impact on his price coupled with the uncertainty of an inform. The beta can be explained by the fact Tiemoue saw large gains in price when the overall market was taking some big hits. 
If the popular FUT player can continue to perform don’t be surprised if we see him again here soon.
Big Loser- Alejandro Gomez (Atalanta)
Ugh; I hate to do “El Papu” like this, but Alejandro Gomez is this week's biggest loser. The Argentine winger has been playing solid for Atalanta. However, the market is reacting to him as a player that was overhyped. The Team of the Group Stage buzz around him seemed to lag behind the others.
Over the week, Gomez spotted a sort of high volatility at around ~6000 with a tame beta of 0.23. Now the figures on him aren’t glorious, but they do reflect how his beta ties him to the market which has seen a marked decline during this “crash”. So, with these stats in mind, hopefully he can put in a quality performance to rebound. 
Unfortunately there's a tough schedule ahead for the team from Bergamo, but don’t sleep on our guy just yet.
Weekend Watch
This new article deserves a new segment, so we decided to highlight some favorable matchups that the Path to Glory players face in real life.
Leroy Sane
Match: Home vs Bournemouth 
-- Outlook: Sane gets quality game time in the best side in the league, and after what Liverpool did to the cherries last week the German winger will be licking his chops. A slight dip in price over the week should make him a little more affordable but he is still bears risk; however, the reward could be monstrous.
Tiemoue Bakayoko
Match: Home vs Southampton
-- Outlook: The Frenchman caused quite a buzz yesterday as he grabbed a goal, yet midweek games don’t often warrant informs. On the other hand, imagine the scenes if the ex-Monaco midfielder scores again. He already permeates the weekend league meta, but he’s also high risk and high reward. .

Rodrigo
Match: Home vs Girona
-- Outlook: Yes, he is making the list for the second week in a row. No price change over the past week and string of relatively easy games puts the ex-Benfica in the consideration category.
Recap
To wrap it up, the Path to Glory market saw a polarizing week in prices. This has been reflected across the broad FUT market with low value special cards rising, while “elites” have been taking hits. It was good to see some TOTW shouts amongst PTG items just to reinforce the cards have value. Finally, with FUTmas slowing down a little, it’ll be great to track these prices over Christmas/Boxing Day.
And of course, be on the lookout for the Ones to Watch market update on Friday!

Day two of FIFA 18 Ultimate Team's TOTY promotion is here in what feels like the blink of an eye -- and now the getting's getting real good.
While some had feared the community vote (as echoed in our own ballot's FH community powered vote) would get too Premier League laden, the results were mostly fair and representative of the best players in the world (with perhaps one or two arguable exceptions). The midfielders in particular were all class in the 2017 calendar year in reality, and in echoing with the spirit of the community vote, for a second straight day, Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne, Chelsea's N'Golo Kante, and Real Madrid stalwart Luka Modric are all inbound.
The trio of outstanding (and worthy, in my opinion) midfielders will be available in packs for the next 24 hours, starting Tuesday, 16 January at 6 p.m. UK until Wednesday at the same time.
That only leaves defenders and midfielders, which based on how the first two days operated (and as evidently confirmed on EA's own site), we'll see tomorrow evening. Now the only question that remains is whether we get the full team re-released Thursday or Friday.
Happy packing."

Today, I'll be reviewing some of my favorite super subs in FUT 18.
Note that this is in no particular order, nor is this a complete list. I'd love if you let me know some of your best super subs in the comments down below!
1. SIF Hirving Lozano

You've all heard of him. You've all seen him. You've all had a new one torn by him.
This man is the real deal. Incredibly fast, fantastic on the ball, with a very good finish on him, the ability to play most passes, and physicality that should not be overlooked.
Through him on as a striker, winger or a wide CAM at the end of games, and he'll tear it up for you. His pace is a complete game-changer against tiring defenders, though I suspect he would be equally effective against fresh ones.
2. POTY Maguire

One of the true bargains of FUT 18 -- for just 15K, you got one of the best attacking minded supersubs money can buy. He's lightning fast, with great dribbling, a cracking shot, and very decent physicality.
He comes on as a ST for me, and is absolutely lethal.
3. IF Braithwaite

A very overlooked option, but a great one nonetheless. He's got my favorite four-star/four-star combo, as well as blistering pace, solid dribbling, a very good shot, decent passing, and most surprisingly, very good physical.
He may be hard to link in your main squad, but bringing him on as a winger or a forward is fantastic. He's quickly become one of my favorite players to bring off the bench.
4. IF Choupo-Moting

The stats on this man are incredible. Not only is he tall and very strong, he has the pace, the shooting, 4-star skills, and most incredibly, that 91-dribbling. He's not quite Zlatan in many aspects, but he's pretty damn close.
I like bringing him on when I'm searching for last-gasp equalizers and game-killing goals. He gives you all the options of a quick, agile striker, but also the threat of a target man.
5. IF Allan

The ideal man to close out games. He's better than Kante for me, and he's incredible at shutting down the attempts of tired attackers.
The thing that I love about this card is how tireless he is. He covers every blade of grass on the field, shuts down every attack, and manages to simultaneously mark three or four players, all on his own.
6. FUTMAS Meunier

Another incredible bargain -- a Gullit Gang player with great height, weak foot and skills.
He's a great defensive sub, both as a CB or as a wide defender, but his true strength is in his use as a midfielder. I bring him on pretty much every game, and he brings pace, power, great defending and a decent attacking threat. I honestly prefer him to the majority of midfielders I have tried this year. I've even thrown him on up front, and he does the job there.
7. POTY Christiansen

Just like POTY Maguire, he was an absolute bargain when he was released. A quick look at his in-game stats shows that this is a player with incredible passing, dribbling, defending and physicality, and much like Allan, he's a great man to close out games. He's not as defensively talented, but he brings a lot to the field creatively and offensively.
A must have for your bench. And a lot of fun to use.
8. NIF Goretzka

You might be shocked that he's included on this list, amongst all the special cards, but this man is the real deal. Height, pace, defensive and passing abilities, and he feels great on the ball.
I'm sure 99% of you have used him, and for many of you, he may be the mainstay of your teams. But do not sleep on this guy's effectiveness as a super sub. He's a real game changer.
9. IF Pablo Perez

This is one that I'm sure has slipped under the radar. I came across him through a happy accident - an untradeable upgrade pack in the first week of the game meant that I'm stuck with him for the year, and I cannot tell you how good he is.
He's very similar to that POTY Christiansen card, but he feels a lot stronger. He can do pretty much anything on the field, and is the perfect utility player. I've brought him on literally every on the field, and he does the job.
10. NIF Balde Diao Keita

I'm ending the list with the best super sub I've used this year, both in terms of effectiveness and value for money. This card is the closest I've come to Martial 2.0 -- he's tall, he's strong, he's incredible on the ball and his shooting is so dam overpowered.
For less than 2K, you can bring one of the most devastating supersubs in the game to your bench.
Those are all the ones that stand out to me -- let me know who you use down below!"

It's-happening dot GIF.
Another OP Heung Min Son is part of FIFA 18's Team of the Week 18. He's joined by an upgrade to OTW James Rodriguez and unsurprisingly, one for PTG Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain too. Luis Suarez gets the crazy 94 OVR ST we all thought he might during TOTY and a wild Timo Werner in-form has appeared as well.
One hidden gem this week may be none other than West Ham's Manuel Lanzini. Those who know know and many of us used Lanzini in early portions of FUT 18 to great success. Will be interesting to see how a special version of the item stacks up.
FIFA 18 TOTW 18 is available in packs at 6 p.m. UK time and will run through the expected full Team of the Year being packs over the course of the weekend. Let us know if there any you're excited about potentially picking up and pack.
Here's the full Team of the Week 18:"

FIFA 18 Ultimate Team's in packs during Christmas and Boxing Day Team of the Week is here.
With plenty of lightning rounds and special packs expected early next week (while perhaps you have some gifted holiday money to burn), these are the special in-form player items you can expect to potentially see in packs as well as on the transfer market.
A new boost to OTW Neymar comes welcomed by the Rolls Royce class of FIFA players but probably won't be tangible to too many ordinary players. Along those lines, former Barcelona teammate Luis Suarez gets his best FUT 18 item to date in the group.
From the possible Weekend League/Squad Battles gems, SIF Aaron Mooy's ratings scream off the database at us, and may well be that super-sub you've been searching for. 
IF Marcos Alonso makes the case for the best Premier League LB (after an LWB->LB position change card item, of course) and rumored Manchester United transfer target Sergej Milinkovic-Savic's new IF might just be the missing link for ""Calcio A"" squad/hybrid builders.
Below is your FUT 18 TOTW 14.
Whatever your background and whatever you celebrate (or don't), happy holidays from all of us at Futhead!"

Market Overview
We can’t talk the FUT market without mentioning the current Team of the Year promotion. Although it’s only the third day, the hype around EA finally releasing some of the best cards in the game has been far reaching. 
In the week leading up to TOTY, the market was already in a “crash”, as prices dropped due to buyers being weary of big prices drops. And, on Monday (Jan 15),  that's exactly what happened. The majority of players across the market dipped as supply from Lightning Rounds overtook demand. 
In the midst of the FUT market decline, the Path to Glory market had some interesting turns and trends.  Most players followed the market, but some strong performances from a few players demonstrated that these items definitely still have value.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  With a market in flux, many players usually demonstrate large high/low differences, and that is apparent in the likes of Kingsley Coman, Alejandro Gomez and Saul. Big ranges show there’s room for a tidy reward, but you have to assume some risk. 
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take:  In terms of large volatility figures, Gabriel Jesus and William Carvalho stand out. If you can get them at their low cycle enjoy some big profit; however, consistent (low) volatility is good too. This can be seen in the likes of Stephan El Shaarawy and Marco Asensio, and their stable prices help traders know when they get a good deal.
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of a card to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Wow, this week has some large beta figures! Highlighting Emil Forsberg, Giuliano, Renato Sanches and Danny Welbeck these players sport high betas because they are seen as high/risk/high reward items. If any of them can put in inform worthy performances expect their price to skyrocket, but in the meantime they seem to deprecate a little each week. 
TOTW Shout 
Finally we have a substantial TOTW shout section! This week both Rodrigo and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain delivered quality performances leading their sides to victory; however, it should also be noted that Leroy Sane delivered a quality goal that got him in the running for a moment.
Ox making it surely rewarded those of you who invested opportunistically. Here's hoping you sold into the hype.
Big Winner - Rodrigo (Valencia)
It had to be either Ox or Rodrigo, and since the Liverpool man was featured here a couple weeks ago, despite his making TOTW, we felt it appropriate to let Rodrigo take the spotlight. The Valencia man, who many will remember from his FIFA 14 items, bagged a goal and assisted another in win this past weekend. Although that doesn’t lock him in for an inform the hype stilled boosted his price. 
A whopping 63.2% weekly return supported by a medium volatility (~3,750) and high beta (2.05) round off Rodrigo’s weekly stats. For such a large percentage jump, his volatility remained low and that can be attributed to his price seeming to cap around 30k. What makes the ex-Benfica man interesting is his high beta of 2.05 suggests that if he does receive an inform that price could spike even further, which would go against the trend of upgraded PTG & OTW items. 

A high risk investment for sure, but if that’s your thing go for it.
Big Loser - Leroy Sane (Manchester City)
Previously a Player of the Month, Leroy Sane finds himself as the biggest loser due to his unfortunate situation. As a player, the ex-Schalke winger has been holding his own and gaining quality minutes; however, in a star studded team like Man City he has been consistently overshadowed as of late. 
This had led to a slow decline of his price as investors lose patience, but a goal to equalize in the beginning of their tie with Liverpool proved there is value here. His volatility is high (~7,500), but a low beta (-0.14) inform investors that if the market turns around then his price can too. 
Sane presents an intriguing position for investors, and our recommendation would be if you can use him in your side then give him a shout as that’ll help you hedge your bet regardless of where his price goes.
Recap
To wrap it up, Team of the Year made its mark before the promotion by dropping prices as buyers got scared. Once, the promo began large supply has continued to drive down most prices. This should continue until the end of the week, yet if you're looking to find some good value for coins the Path to Glory market may be a compelling option. Some class players coming into their own could be profitable by just selling into the hype, so take note and stay Wyse!         

Let us know if you have eyes on any PTG items below, and expect a Ones To Watch update Friday!

Market Overview
A real rollercoaster of a ride for the FIFA Ultimate Team market this past week. Last weekend saw quite a significant drop due to FUTmas promotions, and this continued until around last Tuesday. Now it has mostly stabilized, and buyers for the Weekend League even drove up players' prices. Yet, with more FUTmas promos on the horizon the market is cautious.

Within the Ones to Watch Market specifically, we saw similar trends; however, Player of the Month Salah requirements called for an OTW item. Because of this, the previously cheap (low end) items rocketed up in price -- and hopefully you cashed in! Prices do look to be stabilizing again, but just like above people are hesitant of another Christmas “crash”.

Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  It’s important to note that a lot of those highs were early in the week, and lows were midweek figures. Prices are creeping back up so watch this space.

Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take: Big figures across the board this week, but players like Rodriguez and Lukaku stand out. The two players have seen big drops, but there volatilities could point to huge rebounds if they can put in a compelling performance.     

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of a card to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Most of the players betas are tame due to dropping similar to the market; however, items like Leonardo Bonucci, Bruma and Federico Bernardeschi stand out. All players that saw pretty big price changes this past week; could their fortunes reverse next week? 
TOTW Shout
Three players put in quality performance with Neymar eventually getting an inform. Kylian Mbappe played well but it was always Neymar's game, and Sergie Aurier will be touched on soon.
In-depth daily analysis

For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner -- Serge Aurier (Tottenham) 
After many weeks of mediocrity (in terms of FUT and somewhat to a degree, real life), Serge Aurier sees himself make the Big Winners list. A midweek goal really got this man hyped, and because of this his price shot up! That being said, looking at his stats can reveal some interesting trends. 
Looking at his weekly stats his volatility (~5000) was slightly high relative to his price, but his beta of -3.44 is one to examine. Such a high number is definitely strange, yet his midweek price jump contradicted the market leading to the negative connotation, while the large number is due to the huge hype around him. 
What it all means though is we could see his price plummet again after missing out on the TOTW, but if he ever plays well again look to the Ivorians price to reach new heights.
Big Loser -- Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)
The Liverpool man in flying form got rewarded with a Player of the Month SBC last week, but that doesn’t stop Mohamed Salah ending up in the Big Loser spot. His big price could be attributed to the release of his other card, and this could be could precedence for Team of the Year (Bonucci or Neymar?). 
Over the week, the ex-Roma man sported a very high volatility (51000) and a very tame beta (-0.14) His large volatility demonstrated the big drop he experienced over the week, while his beta reflects that his price drop mirrored the overall market conditions. Another aspect of beta is its utility as a measure of risk, so a low figure shows that if the market rebounds so could the Egyptians price. 

The silver lining this week is that his price is at a low we haven’t seen in weeks. A player of his quality could definitely turn this around in a heartbeat.
Recap & outlook
To wrap it up, a wonderful ride for the market to begin the holiday season saw big drops early, but slight rebounds recently. POTM requirements held up the prices of the low end items, yet definitely watch this space as more FUTmas promotions make buyers insecure. So, some interesting final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Open bids have been money this past week. Fewer buyers lower competition so look to pick up some great deals and flip overnight.

-- OTW investors: Look into picking up players on winter breaks as people will start to offload once they see their cards dropping value. Does an OTW SBC loom on the horizon? 
Have a happy holiday, and may FUTmas be good to you. Also, make sure to check out this past week's Path to Glory update too!

Market Overview
What a wild week for the general Ultimate Team market! This past weekend we saw a Team of the Group Stage “crash” that dropped prices across all types and ratings. Now, over the past couple of days, the prices have stabilized and began to creep up -- but many people are feeling the uncertainty of FUTmas. The holiday promo brings the same appeal of last year, but a lack of packable content could drive the market up even further.
Shifting focus to Ones to Watch specifically, their market followed the general trend, yet there were a few exceptions. I will touch on those anomalies later, but it is interesting to note that most OTW items took a hit early in the week but are seeing a resurgence. 
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  There are some fascinating ranges this week exemplified by the likes of Bonucci, Ederson and Salah. Some big discrepancies that show the markets drop early in the week and rise recently, so make sure you're always checking for deals.

Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take: Of all the players on the list, Neymar sticks out. His extremely high volatility is mostly due to a drop which is perplexing since he got an upgrade, right? Well no, that is how the trend has gone, but his high volatility (~70000) could point to a high rebound in the future if he warrants an upgrade.    

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of a card to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Most items spot small betas reflecting the OTW market shifting with the overall FUT scene, but Hernandez, Traore and Yarmolenko saw greater price fluctuations. 
TOTW Shout
No quality performances to be considered for Team of the Week 13. Let’s hope that changes because who doesn’t like to see a little green in the column? 
In-depth daily analysis

For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner -- Kylian Mbappe (PSG) 
The wonderkid graces the winner’s section once again. No doubt that Kylian Mbappe can play and he was rewarded with a TOTGS inclusion after PSG demolished their group (minus the last game). With his price soaring to over a million he definitely deserves his spot. 
More importantly for the FUT scene, the young Frenchman has seemingly broken the trend of OTW item losing value after an upgrade! Picking on a couple weekly stats, a high volatility (~55,000) and corresponding beta (0.56) depict his variable price swing over the week. They also help to quantify the hype around this card, which is rather high.

Taking a step back from stats, another thing to consider in Kylian breaking the trend is his item’s position. His OTW card is a ST, while his upgrades (and real life position) are RWs. Having him as a central player will always make him more valuable, so let this be a precedence for other player’s upgrades in the future. 
Big Loser -- Davinson Sanchez (Tottenham)
A personal favorite, it pains us to feature Davinson Sanchez as this week's biggest loser. A huge weekly price decline (-34.2%) cannot be ignored, and the majority of the drop can be explained by the Colombian missing out on a TOTGS. But, his other stats offer other valuable insights. 
Looking at the rundown, the Spurs centre back spots similar stats as Mbappe in a high volatility (~6200) and medium beta (0.40) relative to his price. However, Sanchez’s volatility was more a reflection of price declines, while the beta demonstrates the defenders relation to the market. 
Although his stats were bleak this week, they also pointed to the fact that even if the defender was included in the TOTGS the item would have lost value compared to his hype price. Now it wouldn’t have been as dramatic, yet as always the biggest losers have a silver lining in being “cheap” if they perform well in the near future. 
Recap & outlook
To wrap it up, the majority of OTW items followed the market, while a couple separated themselves from the pack. It was great to see a player break the trend of dropping after an upgrade which gives us even more precedence for the future. Prices have stabilized and began to creep up, but remember FUTmas has made many players uneasy.  Just remember to always stay logical, and we’ll leave you with some interesting final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Players are stabilizing, so there are a lot of deals to be made by pickin up on open bid and selling overnight (works for any price range). 
-- OTW investors: Be wary of the big leagues breaks (i.e Bundesliga & Ligue 1) as many players may be looking to off load. Yet, for those looking long term could we see another OTW SBC in February like last year?

In a spin on the usual three-kit per campaign tradition of recent years, Adidas and four European super club have brought FIFA to the forefront of the shirt design movement.
Exclusive to FIFA 18's Ultimate Team game mode, the football gear manufacturers in conjunction with the quartet of Champs League (and EA partner) clubs Manchester United, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, and Juventus all announced digital-only fourth kits, available immediately in FUT 18. In a pretty cool gesture, any fan who had any of the four clubs as their favorite set in the game mode before 14 December automatically get the new digital fourth kit added to their Ultimate Team.
For the rest of us, the kits are available in packs as well on the Transfer Market immediately. Even if you're a fan of one of these, pulling a tradeable version early would be a pretty quick and easy 5000 coin profit.
The United design is showcased above but here are the Madrid, Bayern Munchen, and Juve ones as well:

My first official 4/4 last week seemed to help a lot of you get Onyekuru, and with a slight change in format this week due to the Christmas break, we will hopefully have even more successful predictions.
With many leagues having stopped for a winter break, we have a very exciting change to Matchups this week, where we have all 10 games from the traditional ‘Boxing Day matches’ to choose from, with the games spread between the 26th and 28th of December.
With a potential 10 Matchups points on offer, there are 5 different players you can choose to claim, depending on what and who you need more, obviously with it being easier to get them as you get more results correct.
So, let’s get down to business in with this weeks’ fixtures.

Spurs v Southampton
We start off in London with Spurs hosting Southampton. Spurs have been in fairly poor form, before recovering for a couple of weeks and then being torn apart by runaway league leaders Manchester City last week. 
Southampton are in some of the worst form in the league just now, with just one win in their last 9 games. Falling down the table with no clear way of stopping their poor run puts increased pressure on the 4 games over the short 11 day period around Christmas and New Year where they really need to pick up some vital points, or face a potential relegation battle in the next few months.
Spurs two games before last weekend showed that they have turned their form around, so I can only see this game going one way and that’s with a home win.
Game played: Tuesday 26th, 12:30 p.m. GMT/7:30 a.m. EST
My prediction: Spurs win

Watford v Leicester City
Watford are another side who are struggling for form, with only 1 point from their last 5 games they have the joint second worst form in the past month. Their opponents Leicester will be hoping to get back to winning ways after a 3-0 loss against Crystal Palace last week followed by a close loss in the cup against Manchester City midweek. 
Going into the game, Leicester are the obvious favourites, but with Watford at home, the game may not be as one sided as it appears on paper, but I believe that it will be the Foxes who get the three points from this game
Game played: Tuesday 26th, 3:00 p.m. GMT/ 10:00 a.m. EST
My prediction: Leicester win

West Brom v Everton
What a turnaround Everton have had since replacing Ronald Koeman with Big Sam. 1 month ago, Everton were in 16th place with just 3 wins and 3 draws to their name in 12 games. Since then, they have more than doubled their points total and are the third best side in the league for form, behind the two Manchester teams. 
Their hosts for this match, West Brom, have managed to survive in the Premier League for a number of years due to their solid defence, which makes up for their lack of goalscoring ability. This year, their luck appears to be running out, as they find themselves in 19th place as we near the halfway point of the season. They got off to a solid start, with back to back 1-0 wins, but in the 16 games since, they haven’t won and have kept just 2 clean sheets. Things are looking very dire for the Baggies, who are in desperate need for a turnaround in form.
In the past encounters between these sides, West Brom only have one victory since 2013, and I can’t see that run changing now either.
Game played: Tuesday 26th, 3:00 p.m. GMT/ 10:00 a.m. EST
My prediction: Everton win

Bournemouth v West Ham
Having taken just 3 points from their last 18 available, Bournemouth find themselves falling down the table, having just been overtaken by this weeks opponents West Ham. Coming into this game off the back of a 4-0 thrashing from Liverpool won’t have helped their confidence either, so they will be hoping something can special can help turn their season around.
Who would have thought that David Moyes return to the Premier League would be as good as it has been. West Ham have started turning on the style in recent weeks, with Marko Arnautovic, Manuel Lanzini and co. starting to find form at the perfect time to see them climb up the table. A retrospective two match ban for the Argentine playmaker as a result of diving may cause some issues in attack for the Hammers in the next couple of games, but he will be back and available for selection for this match and no doubt raring to go.
Sice both sides have been in the Premier League, they have both won 2 games, showing just how evenly matched these sides have been recently. I believe that West Ham should have the advantage, especially with Lanzini coming back into the team and well rested after his ban.
Game played: Tuesday 26th, 3:00 p.m. GMT / 10:00 a.m. EST
My prediction: West Ham win

Chelsea v Brighton
Chelsea have a tough game this weekend against Everton, so may be tempted to rest some players as a result of that game and their next game against Stoke, ahead of a London derby against Arsenal in the first game in the New Year.
Brighton are currently midtable, but a tough run of fixtures including games against Liverpool, Spurs and Manchester United has seen them only pick up two points from their last six matches. 
Chelsea should win this game comfortably if they go into the game with a reasonably strong team, and Brighton may have to hope that Chelsea decide to rest a number of their regular starters and can catch them off guard slightly.
Game played: Tuesday 26th, 3:00 p.m. GMT / 10:00 a.m. EST
My prediction: Chelsea win

Huddersfield v Stoke City
Huddersfield and Stoke face off for the first time in just over 16 years, with the last meeting being when they were both playing in League One.
Huddersfield have managed to boost their confidence recently with a solid 2-0 win over Brighton and then a 4-1 win away to Watford a week later, with a 3-1 loss to Chelsea in between those games. 
Stoke sit just 1 point above the relegation zone, with the worst defensive record in the league. Big losses against Chelsea, Manchester City and Spurs, combined with none of their attackers seeming capable of scoring in recent weeks, paints a pretty bleak picture going into the hectic festive period of games.
Both of their matches in the 2001/02 season ended in a draw, and I have a feeling that’s how this one may end up as well, as neither side is in great form. However, Huddersfield have managed a couple of decent wins recently and have been scoring -- something their opponents have only managed once in their last 3 games -- so they would be the more likely side to take home the three points with Stoke falling ever closer to the foot of the table.
Game played: Tuesday 26th, 3:00 p.m. GMT / 10:00 a.m. EST
My prediction: Huddersfield win

Manchester United v Burnley
Manchester United suffered a shock defeat in the cup against Bristol City, so will no doubt be wanting to bounce back against a surprisingly strong Burnley side. Having rested the majority of their normal XI, they will no doubt bounce back with a strong performance against Leicester on Saturday, followed quickly by the game we are interested in on Tuesday.
Burnley currently sit 6th in the league -- ahead of Spurs and just just two points behind Liverpool in 4th, and look like they may end up being a surprise challenger for a European competition spot next season if they can keep up this form. However, a tough run of games against Spurs, Manchester United and Liverpool, with one against Huddersfield in between, may define their ability to challenge come the end of the season.
With United being at home, and also highly motivated to try and keep tabs on their record-breaking rivals, I believe that United should win this game, but an upset result is definitely not off the cards.
Game played: Tuesday 26th, 3:00 p.m. GMT / 10:00 a.m. EST
My prediction: Manchester United win

Liverpool v Swansea City
Liverpool host Swansea in what should be an easy game on paper for the hosts. 
Liverpool are in fine form, with Coutinho and Firmino starting to get among the goals to join Salah in forming one of the best attacks in the league just now. However, with a tough game against Arsenal on the 22nd, and then what could be a tough game on the 30th against Leicester, Klopp may choose to rest some of his big names in this game, to allow them to have players well rested for their tougher games.
Swansea, who parted company with manager Paul Clement on Wednesday, will be hoping for a quick turnaround in fortune, if they are going to repeat the incredible escape they managed last season, having been bottom of the league at New Year and managed to avoid relegation.
Liverpool may be lacking true strength in depth, but I believe they have too much quality for a very poor Swansea side.
Game played: Tuesday 26th, 5:30 p.m. GMT / 12:30 p.m. EST
My prediction: Liverpool win

Newcastle v Manchester City
This game is pits the two sides in the most contrasting form against each other.
On one hand, Newcastle have gained just 1 point, scored 6 and conceded 19 in their last 9 games. Manchester City, haven’t dropped a single point, scored 24 and conceded 7 in that time.
Even if Manchester City rest the majority of their first team, like they did against Leicester in the Cup during the week, they still have ample quality on the bench to be able to dismantle a very poor Newcastle side who look like they will be going straight back to playing Championship football next season.
Game played: Wednesday 27th, 7:45 p.m. GMT / 2:45 p.m. EST
My prediction: Manchester City win

Crystal Palace v Arsenal
Had this game come just a few weeks ago, everyone would have backed Arsenal to win it with ease, but Palace have had an excellent turn in form which has seen them go unbeaten since the International break in early November. Having picked up wins against Watford and, more surprisingly, Leicester in recent weeks, have what should be an easy game against Swansea on Saturday before heading into this match and try and keep their good vein of form going. With Benteke out suspended for the game on the 23rd, he should come back raring to go and well rested ahead of this match, which should make Palace fans happy.
Arsenal, being Arsenal, make things quite difficult to predict. Having struggled to draws against Southampton and West Ham, then only scraping a narrow 1-0 win over Newcastle, they may struggle against a resurgent Palace side who are starting to find form. This game, along with their subsequent one against West Brom, are sandwiched between games at home to Liverpool and Chelsea, so there is always a  chance of Wenger rotating his side around to make sure everyone is fresh for the bigger gages 
When these two last met in April, Palace recorded their first win over the Gunners in over 13 years, but whether they can do it again remains to be seen. I feel like this may end up a score draw, but it all depends on what Arsenal team shows up, and how much the game against Liverpool on the 22nd takes out of them.
Game played: Thursday 28th, 8:00 p.m. GMT / 3:00 p.m. EST
My prediction: Draw

So, with 10 free points up for grabs, you can do a variety of different things.

After a few tough outings, Aaron is in-form himself this week, missing just 5 of the 23 man TOTW 14 contingent. And it's probably a good time to get a low score in with the festive football period about to bring big games almost every day of the week, making predictions a little more difficult than normal. But even with a fantasticly low score, we still missed the best Spaniard in English football and a truly heroic strike all the way from Columbia. 
We hope you enjoy an entirely predictable Christmas! 
David Silva – CM – Manchester City
David Silva missed Man City’s big match against Spurs on the weekend due to personal reasons, but his performance mid-week against Swansea has got him in to TOTW 14 and secured his TIF. Silva was at his imperious best against the Swans scoring twice and commanding almost 11% of City’s entire team possession in their 4-0 win. With Silva missing the Spurs game this was a tough one to predict, but there are no doubts that along with De Bruyne and Sterling he is one of the in-form men in the Premier League right now. City maintain their seemingly unassailable 11 point advantage at the top. 
Aaron's View: There was always likely to be a Man City IF after two convincing wins over the past week, but with Silva, Sterling, De Bruyne, Gundogen and Sane all in contention, I chose to focus on other options.
Henry Rojas – CM – Millonarios FC
After a tight 1-0 win for Millonarios in the first leg of the Categoría Primera A finals, the second remained finely poised as Santa Fe looked to claw back that slender advantage. And they did just that scoring early through Wilson Morelo from the penalty spot to make the final game very interesting indeed. A goal each as the match advanced left the tie balanced at 2-2 until Henry Rojas popped up to smash an absolute worldy of a half volley which found the bottom right corner of the net. Every inch, a hero’s goal and a well-deserved Hero IF. Congratulations to Millionarios FC on their title win. 
Aaron's View: Hands up, I was oblivious to the importance of this match and therefore I didn't even consider Rojas.
Sime Vrsaljko – RB – Atletico Madrid
Atletico Madrid are doing their level best to keep pace with Barcelona this season and they made it four wins on the bounce against Alaves on the weekend, where Fernando Torres popped up with the solitary goal in their 1-0 win. Vrsaljko grabbed the assist for that Torres goal which along with a clean sheet is enough for him to make TOTW 14. Given that our prediction for this defensive slot Federico Fazio scored for Roma in a 1-0 win and kept a clean sheet as well, he can perhaps feel slightly aggrieved. 
Aaron's View: There were far better defensive options than Vrsaljko this week, who was not even awarded MOTM. However, I feel a lack of La Liga options in general have helped his selection massively.
Djibril Sidibe – RB – Monaco
After a blip of two league losses in a row, Monaco are back on track in Ligue 1 and they took that good form to St Etienne who they duly despatched 4-0. Goalkeeper Ruffier was sent off for St Etienne early in the second half but in truth the damage was already done with goals from Fabinho, Lemar, Keita and our TOTW 14 fullback Sidibe securing the three points. With Fabinho getting a goal and an assist he was a very strong IF candidate from this game (as predicted) but Sidibe gets the nod from right back. 
Aaron's View: I opted for Sidibe's team mate Fabinho but with an expected upcoming Futmas item in the cards for him, it looks as though he has been ignored on that basis.
Josip Ilicic – RF – Atalanta
Atalanta and Lazio fought it out in a Serie A classic on the weekend with the match ebbing and flowing until the game eventually ended up finishing 3-3. Ilicic was Atlanta’s main goal threat grabbing one in each half, one of which gave his side the lead from the penalty spot only for Lazio to equalise late on. Whilst this was a great game, it’s very rare to get two IF’s from a draw but here we are, with Ilicic and Savic making the cut for TOTW 14. 
Aaron's View: I already had a player included from this match in Savic, and it is rare that two make IF's make it from one game, especially when they're on opposing sides; I ignored Josip because of that."

Finally! A week again with some bigger match Marquee Matchups. That being said, the next couple of weeks are going to be some interesting times as some major leagues are taking their winter breaks. 
The loss of some prominent fixtures will narrow down the pool of options, but at the same time it keeps the predictions interesting: 
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Celtic vs Rangers
Match Info: We start this week’s prediction with the famed Old Firm derby. A great game between Scotland’s historic clubs always entertains. People have been stocking up, but look to the non-rare silvers for a solid investment. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Torino vs Genoa
Match Info:  The Serie A has featured quite a lot lately. However, with pending winter breaks across a number of other big leagues, the Derby of the Northwest seems a fitting inclusion. It is off the hype-radar just enough, so get those non-rare golds ready.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 rated


Player Requirement: 2 to 3 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Wigan vs Shrewsbury
Match Info: After the current inclusion of English League Two sides, it seems natural for EA to turn their attention to England’s League One. These two teams sit a top the table and make for an interesting fixture that could have future promotion implications.   

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 70 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Everton vs United
Match Info: Not many marquee PL matches this cycle, yet it would be interesting to see the inclusion of a match where Rooney squares off against his old side. Regardless, it's tough for EA to ignore the Premier league so we have to do our due diligence anyways.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there tends to be some variance each week, let's take a look at some more outside the box picks that could make their way in:
AC Milan vs Inter (Cup)
Match Info: The fact that this match is a cup game, coupled with the fact AC Milan appear on this week's MM, has dropped this to a sleeper pick. A derby between the two teams from Milan always merit consideration, yet this presents an interesting circumstance for EA and investors alike.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Hearts vs Hibernian
Match Info: If EA go and pull another stunt by leaving out big games, this could be a great place to hedge your bets. A rivalry between these two lesser SPL sides offers a low risk option that could be used regardless of what match is selected.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 70 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Al Nassar FC vs Al Ahli
Match Info: The Saudi League has gotten snubbed as of late, but could their fortunes change when the first and third place sides meet next weekend? Hopefully. Plenty of investment options here.

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 80 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
Its the holiday season, why not take a jolly ol stab:
Any PL match this coming week, really.
Investing Strategies
It's that time. Remember to take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team on how to possible make a few coins with would-be Marquee Matchups:

-- Prioritize investing in players who are members of the two teams featuring in a specific Marquee Matchup (higher rated the better)
-- Non-Rare cards usually have a higher return on investment
-- Certain positions such as LB/RB, CMs and STs are generally more profitable*"

The concept squad leak was spot on.
Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, on the heels of a brilliant November, captures the real-life honor and accompanying purple-and-gold Squad Buildling Challenge unlockable special item in FUT.
Though he was technically one of seven finalists, the award seemed more and more of a gimme than any vote in recent memory. Salah played four Premier League matches in the month of November contributing to 3 wins and a draw and netting a wild seven (!) goals in the process.
""Each month I want to score many goals and help the team to win games,"" Salah said in a release.
""That month, I scored seven goals and it's a good feeling, but for me the most important thing is the result and we had good results that month.""
The ~350k coin question becomes: is the SBC worth it?
On paper, our instinct is no. The Ones to Watch has settled around 10-15% more than that (after a spike when Salah's victory was announced, undoubtedly powered by naive/confused types who don't understand that the OTW isn't upgraded as a result of POTM wins), and with just another two special items will be as good if not better.
If you've done the SBC and given him a go in the Weekend League or in Squad Battles, let us know how it is in the comments below."

Over the past couple of weeks, we’ve received quite a few requests to expand our Ones to Watch weekly analysis into the Path to Glory (PTG) player market. These PTG items function just like Ones to Watches in terms of upgrades, so it is a natural enough addition which we are happy to bring to you. That said, it will be interesting to see if similar trends can be detected across the two markets, so let's get into the report!
Market Overview
Team of the Group Stage came in with a bang, with extremely high profile players and two days of lightning rounds. The allure of packing that ST Ronaldo, coupled with “better” pack offers led to a huge increase in supply that drove prices down across the Ultimate Team market. 
Although Path to Glory players are out of packs, the surrounding market conditions led to the majority of these items dipping in price too. A lot of the price drop can be credited to investor panic; however, there is a silver lining. A majority of these PTG players get solid minutes for their clubs, and recently a couple earned themselves an upgrade which drove up their price. This at least let's people know the items can hold value and shouldn’t be ignored. 

Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  Most of the players saw a significant drop in price this week, yet it will be interesting to see if items can rebound to their highs in the coming weeks. 
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take: Interestingly, this week saw high volatility among PTG players. Some relatively low value players like Forsberg, Origi and Stindl fluctuated greatly over the week. Could’ve been profitable if you got in at the right times...  

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of a card to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Two betas really jump out and those are Hart and Wagner’s. Both players high figures demonstrate that they could have a huge price swing if the market rebounds or they put in a compelling performance.
TOTW Shout 
It is important to mention that Coman and Giuliano both were included in the current Team of the Week, yet looking to Wednesday only one player warrants a look: Saul. The Atletico midfielder grabbed a tidy goal in their win over the weekend. 
Big Winner -- Saul (Atletico Madrid)
Besides the already upgraded PTG (Coman and Giuliano), Saul saw the largest weekly increase. His price jump can be attributed to the hype after his goal; however, it's still important to look at his weekly stats to explain the trend. 
In terms of volatility, the Spanish midfielder spotted a high figure around 4,800. His beta was also relatively high at 0.7, so when one looks at both of those together it explains this items large price shift after the hype. By examining the statistics, it can be concluded that similar players to Saul will experience parallel price trends.
Big Loser --  Marquinhos (Paris Saint-Germain)
Many players took a hit this week, but we wanted to highlight the drastic drop of Marquinhos. The PSG defender’s price plummeted after he was omitted from the TOTGS, and that trend of such a large drop after the hype is very significant. 
Taking a step back, Marquinhos’s volatility was high (~11,000), yet his beta remain low at around 0.36. The conflicting measures are interesting as his volatility depict his large dropped at the beginning of the period; however, a small beta demonstrates that the rest of his daily returns were relatively similar to the PTG market trend. 
As an important figure in his side, the Brazilian defender still merits his value. Make sure to monitor this item. 

Weekend Watch
This new article deserves a new segment, so we decided to highlight some favorable matchups that the Path to Glory players face in real life.
Alejandro Gomez
Match: Home vs Lazio 
-- Outlook: With 5 goals and 6 assists across both the Serie A and Europa league season, El Papu has been in fine form. Being a fan favorite (and pace merchant) sees the Argentine winger spot a hefty price tag; however, a home tie against a struggling Lazio offers a favorable match. Regardless of the item, definitely catch this match! 

Tiemoue Bakayoko
Match: Home vs Southampton
-- Outlook: The Frenchman caused quite a buzz yesterday as he grabbed a goal, yet mid week games don’t usually warrant informs. On the other hand, imagine the scenes if the ex-Monaco midfielder scores again. He already permeates the weekend league meta, but he’s also high risk and high reward. .

Rodrigo
Match: Away vs Eibar
-- Outlook: Already bagging 8 goals in La Liga, including one against Barcelona, the spanish striker has been instrumental in Valencia’s surprising season. He has cooled off recently, yet a weaker Eibar side could be just what Rodrigo needs to break his cold spell.
Recap
To wrap it up, the Path to Glory market saw more lows than highs in this first week. Although most of the price drops reflect broader market conditions the PTG market has hope. Their dynamic upgrade potential, and fact most of them get solid game time, means we could see some great twists and turns for these items, so watch this space. 
And of course, be on the lookout for the Ones to Watch market update on Friday!

Overall, not the most inspiring Team of the Week this week with one or two absolutely inexplicable inclusions from EA. Given the circumstances, Aaron has done an excellent job to miss just nine players from his TOTW prediction, but the big one he missed, is probably his biggest of the season so far. Let's find out what you all want to know -- why he didn't pick Super Dave for TOTW 12. 
David De Gea – GK – Manchester United
The most obvious omission from our prediction is, of course, David De Gea, who put in a sensational goalkeeping display in Manchester United’s counter attacking 3-1 win against Arsenal, in which he made a league record 14 saves. Try as they might, Arsenal just could not get past the man who is undoubtedly the best goalkeeper in the world at the moment. 
Aaron's View: The less said about this one the better; I tried to be clever and it came back to bite me.
Dave's View: :D
Kyriakos Papadopoulos – CB – Hamburg SV
Hamburg and Frieburg played out an uninspiring 0-0 draw in the Bundesliga last weekend, a result which did neither club any favours as they are both hovering in and around the relegation zone. Why Papadopoulos? He was the best defender for his side on the day with ten clearances and two interceptions to his name rounding off a very solid performance. That said, this is still a very surprising IF pick. 
Aaron's View: 0 goals, 0 assists in a 0-0 draw; I did manage to predict one of these in Telles, but two would have been something else.
Beto – GK – Goztepe SK
Goztepe made it back-to-back wins in the Turkish Superlig last weekend with a 1-0 win away to Karabukspor. And it was all thanks to their keeper Beto, who made eight saves including a first half penalty when the game was still tied at 0-0. A fine performance from the Portuguese stopper. 
Aaron's View: I was happy with my goalkeepers this week, but obviously EA wanted two gold rather than two silver and ultimately Maignan was robbed.
Roberto Rosales – RB – Malaga
Malaga are rock bottom of La Liga and only managed a 0-0 draw against Levante in La Liga on Friday in a match they dominated racking up 18 shots. However, they failed to convert any of those chances and so in a stoke of what I assume is luck, Roasles makes the TOTW for his contribution from right back. I don’t even know what to say anymore. 
Aaron's View: EA are liking their defenders from 0-0 draws this week with Rosales making it a third, and another hard one to predict.
Benjamin Andre – CDM – Rennes
Rennes are having a great season so far in France and they continued that form with back-to-back wins this week in Ligue 1. The first a 2-1 win at Angers and the second a 2-0 win at home to Amiens. Central midfielder Andre scored in both those games and grabbed an assist as well to cap off a great week for the Frenchman. 
Aaron's View: Ligue 1 was limited in terms of IF options and whilst Andre got a 7 from L’Equipe with his goal and assist, better options were present for me.
Ibai Gomez – RM –  Alaves
Another club in trouble in La Liga are Alaves but they recorded an impressive 3-2 win against Girona in the Monday night fixture in Spain. Ibai Gomez bagged all three goals for Alaves, one from the penalty spot and one a dramatic 92nd minute winner. That’s a huge result for Alaves, who are now just three points from safety and a well deserved IF for Gomez.

Aaron's View: This one was an obvious selection but I had already released my prediction when Gomez bagged his hat-trick. 
Alfre Finnbogason – ST – Augsburg
Augsburg are another side having a great season (in Germany this time) with their second win in a week coming courtesy of Mainz who they beat 3-1. Finnbogason scored twice in that match which is more than enough for him to make TOTW 12 based on some of the selections this week. 
Aaron's View: Two goals from Finnbogason, one of which was from the spot. It was a convincing performance from Augsburg and I feel as though that has worked in his favour.
Markel Bergara – CM – Getafe
The surprise win of the weekend no doubt goes to ten man Getafe who halted Valencia’s title charge with a 1-0 win made doubly hard after Arambarri saw red in the first half. The red didn’t dent the home sides confidence however, with Bergara scoring the in the second half to seal the win.  Valencia had all the possession but couldn't find the equaliser.

Aaron's View: Bergara may have scored the only goal in Getafe’s 1-0 win but it was Guaita who stood out. Very cheap inclusion for me.
Davit Skhirtladze – CAM –  Silkeborg IF
And finally, this week we head over to the Danish Superlig where Silkeborg beat Randers FC, 3-2. Davit Skirtladze scored twice in this one including the winning goal in the 70th minute after Robert Skov levelled things up from the penalty spot. Yet another odd pick from EA to round off a difficult week for predictions. 
Aaron's View: A brace in the Danish league for a non-gold option is not something you see everyday."

After the hotness that was FUT 18's Team of the Week 12, it was probably reasonable to expect some regression to the mean.
European Team of the Tournaments: Group Stage will be out of packs this coming Friday. And while we're not expecting any sexy new promos until likely Futmas -- assuming it goes forward the way it did a year prior -- a little bit more vanilla TOTW 13 was likely always in the cards.
As anticipated, this latest FIFA Team of the Week isn't loaded with world beaters, but there's a few items on the upper band of the ratings spectrum worth getting excited about.
For his efforts against Juventus, Inter Milan's Samir Handanovic goes up to 89-overall, in an item that'll now undoubtedly both compete with Thibaut Courtois for Weekend League inclusion plus give you Squad Battles nightmares in weeks to come. While not a ST player item, Heung Min Son of Tottenham Hotspur/South Korea fame gets his best FIFA 18 item to date, which could become that super sub you've been looking for or perhaps finally usurp Anthony Martial in your starting XI.
86 Riyad Mahrez and 86 Nicolas Otamendi help round out the side (what up, Hero Jozy Altidore!) but the lower rated items of the team probably won't do much in the way of enticing you to rip through packs.
Lower demand sometimes (usually) means higher prices though, so perhaps there could be some investment wins to be had yet (assuming there isn't a big surprise in-game event this coming week).

Another solid week of predictions with 3/4 correct results, so let’s hope that this week is just as good, if not better.
With not so many big games being played this weekend, we have a few games from lower leagues that may be a bit tougher to predict.
This week, if you get all of this weeks’ results correct, you will obtain a very pacey http://www.futhead.com/18/players/8439/henry-onyekuru/ card. He may not seem to appealing at first look, but a very pacey Nigerian player to help you with getting and upgrading Jay-Jay Okocha, who will hopefully be coming quite soon.
So, let's get into this weeks’ games.

Derby County v Aston Villa
We start of in the English Championship, in a game between two teams currently sitting just a few points off the automatic promotion spots. 
Both teams are in fine form, with Derby probably slightly edging it in that aspect, having recovered from a poor start to the season which saw them gather 12 points from their first 27 available, before finding form and moving their way up the table to 4th.
Aston Villa have been a bit more inconsistent so far, with draws against Millwall and Leeds in the last two games possibly putting a bit more pressure on them to get a much needed win to get back into the promotion chase.
In recent years, these games have tended to favour a home win - the home team has only lost once since 2000 when these two sides have faced, which is what I think will be the result again this time.
Game time: Saturday 16th, 3:00pm (GMT)/10:00am (EST)
My prediction: Derby win

Torino v Napoli
Napoli will be hoping to recover from their loss to Juventus a couple of weeks ago by beating the other team from Turin, as they travel to face Torino. Having not won in their last 3 games, Napoli’s goalscoring prowess seems to have almost disappeared, but they will be hoping Insigne and Co. stop that poor run in its tracks with a solid win.
Torino are currently 9th, and enjoying an 8 match unbeaten run stretching back to October. However, they have only kept clean sheets on 3 occasions in that run, and drew 4 of those games. An inspiring 3-1 win away to fifth placed Lazio should mean that confidence is high among their players, but whether they can follow that up with a win over a much stronger and more motivated Napoli side remains to be seen.
When these sides faced each other last season, Napoli scored 5 on both occasions, and although they may not manage that feat again this season, I believe that they should have enough to beat Torino.
Game time: Saturday 16th, 5:00pm (GMT)/12:00pm (EST)
My prediction: Napoli win

Club Brugge v Anderlecht
Two of Belgium’s ‘Big Three’ face off in what looks to be a very important game for both teams.
Brugge are currently 6 points clear at the top of the table, and boast the most goals scored and best defensive record so far this season. They have only lost once since early September, and look to be cruising to the top of the regular season title already. A win in this game would put extend their lead over their regular title rivals to an impressive 13 points after just 19 games.
Their opponents, and last year’s league winners, Anderlecht sit 10 points adrift after suffering a loss to second place Charleroi last weekend, and in desperate need of a turn in form if they wish catch up to their opponents in the league.
Anderlecht’s main hope is resting on the fact that they drew 0-0 when the sides met just over a month ago, so they will definitely take a repeat result, but even that looks like it may be easier said than done.
Game time: Sunday 17th, 1:30pm (GMT)/8:30am (EST)
My prediction: Brugge win

Lyon v Marseille
We end this week in France, in a very important fixture. Lyon, Marseille and Monaco are currently all tied on 35 points -- 9 behind leaders PSG and 8 ahead of 5th place Nantes - so look set to be battling amongst themselves for the Champions League and Europa League qualification spots come the end of the season, and this is the type of game that could sway that one way or the other. Lyon are on top of the three based on goal difference, but their 1 goal advantage over Monaco and 7 goal advantage over Marseille could easily be wiped out after a couple of impressive or poor performances, so a win is key for both sides.
Lyon started the season off very poorly, with just 1 win in their first 7 games in all competitions, but a very late Fekir goal to seal a 3-2 win over Monaco seemed to kickstart their season and see them win 8 of their next 9 matches. A disappointing 2-1 loss at home to Lille couple of weeks ago, followed by a 1-0 loss away to Atalanta in the Europa League group stage may have slightly knocked their confidence, but they are no doubt in the better form of the two sides.
Marseille suffered a very disappointing Round of 16 cup loss on penalties to Rennes during the week, which would have caused them additional unnecessary fatigue of having to play 120 minutes plus the stress of a penalty shootout, while Lyon played a much weakened side and were convincingly beaten 4-1 by Montpellier -- a result which may affect some players confidence, but they will be far less fatigued than their opponenets.
5 of the previous 6 matches between these two have ended in stalemate -- one being a cup match last season which Marseille won in Extra Time, and the other match being won just 9 days prior to that one by Lyon.
Had it not been for Marseille fielding a strong team for the Coupe de la Ligue match, I would have definitely predicted a draw for this game, but I feel that the blow, both mentally and physically, from that game sways things in the hosts favour.
Game time: Sunday 17th, 8:00pm (GMT)/3:00pm (EST)
My prediction: Lyon win

The line between success and failure with TOTW predictions is a fine one. And that was proved correct in triplicate this week with Aaron missing multiple players from his prediction due to teammates from the same game picking up the IF instead. So we have those players to investigate and the usual dose of big name misses too. 
Riyad Mahrez – RM – Leicester
After looking in all sorts of trouble, Claude Puel really has steadied the ship at Leicester City, who now sit in a comfortable 8th position in the Premier League. That up-turn in form has largely been inspired by the form and influence of Riyad Mahrez who scored for the second time in three matches in The Foxes 3-2 win against Newcastle. This looks like a great IF as well. 
Aaron's View: A bit of a random one, especially seeing as this is Mahrez’s second IF. One goal in a narrow 3-2 win and nothing special about the performance either.
Saul – CM – Atletico Madrid
Atletico Madrid maintained their unbeaten start to the La Liga season on Sunday grinding out a 1-0 win against Real Betis. That run has contained six draws already so it was a crucial three points for Simeone’s men for them to keep pace with the leaders. Saul Niguez has been one of Atleti’s most consistent performers this season, and scored the winner in this one as well. 
Aaron's View: The PTG item bias seems to have played a part here, but with several good performances from Saul in recent weeks, he was overdue an IF.
Winston Reid – CB – West Ham
I don’t think anyone (myself included) saw a David Moyes inspired West Ham getting anything against Chelsea in the early kick-off on Saturday, but eat our words we must, as the Hammers produced a battling display to win 1-0. Arnautovic and Masuaku would have been the obvious IF picks, but Winston Reid gets the nod for helping preserve that all important clean sheet. 
Aaron's View: The first of three selections from which I incorrectly predicted a teammate to pick up the IF instead. I had both Masuaku and Arnautovic in with a chance, but it's Reid that’s come in under the radar. 
Samir Handanovic – GK – Inter Milan
With the top four sides in Serie A all drawing last weekend, no ground was really gained in the title race. The big game was of course Inter Mlan vs Juventus, where Handanovic put in a brilliant goalkeeping display. The Slovenian made 8 saves to earn his side a clean sheet against a rampant Juve forward line who racked up 19 shots in total. His second IF of FIFA 18. 
Aaron's View: With Sorrentino being the keeper of the week in Italy, I felt Handanovic would miss out as a result. EA have opted to go with two keepers from the Italian league though, which doesn't happen very often. 
Leon Bailey – LM – Bayer Leverkusen
Bayer Leverkusen overcame Stuttgart in the Friday night game in the Bundesliga with a fairly comfortably 2-0 win. While he wasn’t amongst the goal scorers, the standout performer on the night was the impressive Leon Bailly who assisted both goals from left wing. A player to keep your eye on over the next few years for sure and a nice IF for FUT 18.
Aaron's View: I opted for Bailey’s team mate Leno in this one, as he was awarded MOTM, but Bailly himself was a close second and a fair choice with two assists.
Christophe Kerbrat – CB – Guingamp
Guingamp made light work of Dijon in the Ligue 1 after defender Habaddi was sent off in the 12th minute for the away side. A goal and an assist for FUT favourite Jimmy Briand gave him a real chance of a nostalgic inform, but centre back Kerbrat gets the nod for his goal and cleansheet. Maybe next week Jimmy? 
Aaron's View: Another incorrect teammate prediction here, and much like Bailly, Kerbat was not MOTM in his match with Briand claiming that honour. Personally, I feel as though EA have got this one wrong.
Roy Gelmi – CB – FC Thun
After a run of three league losses in a row, FC Thun made it back-to-back wins in the Swiss League with a 3-2 win over Sion where all five goals were scored in the first half. No clean sheet, but with centre back Roy Gelmi getting on the scoresheet twice, he was always likely to grab an IF this week. 
Aaron's View: There were multiple defenders with two goals this week and I went for Graz’s option as the result took them to the top of the table. Gelmi was the alternate and I didn’t get the luck on this one.
Francisco Meza – CB – Tigres
When a team clinches the league championship, IFs and special items are always going to be on the cards, and that especially applies when you’re a defender who scores the winning goal. And that’s exactly what Meza did in the 35th minute in the Liga MX end of season game. Tigres managed to hold on in the second half to win their third title in a row. 
Aaron's View: Tigres winning the league title was always likely to produce a special item but it would have been sheer guesswork between three players had I taken the punt.
Guido Carrillo – ST – Monaco
When managers make half time substitutions, they expect impact. And that’s exactly what Guido Carrillo provided as his side proceeded to go 2-0 down to Troyes just after the break. An own-goal gave Monaco the opportunity they needed, and Carrillo duly capitalised scoring twice in three minutes late on to secure the points for Monaco. A great substitutes performance. 
Aaron's View: I was put off by the fact Carillo was Silver and that I already had an array of Ligue 1 selections. Two goals and an 8/10 always made him a viable option though."

Another week, another curveball from EA with the Marquee Matchups this week. Some questionable inclusions, but I mean who doesn't revel in the historic Arsenal vs Newcastle derby.

But we got to keep on plugging:
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Real Madrid vs Barcelona
Match Info: It’s El Clasico! Can you imagine the scenes if EA left this out? The Manchester Derby backlash was already scathing. Look to the non-rares, especially Spanish ones, as solid investments. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 79 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


AC Milan vs Atalanta
Match Info:  With the two teams only 50 minutes apart, this local rivalry has gained traction with Atalanta’s rise to prominence. It’s a compelling match that gives EA access into a Serie A fixture, and with little hype and plenty of cheap players it could make you a couple coins. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 rated


Player Requirement: 2 to 3 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Arsenal vs Liverpool
Match Info: The biggest matchup to feature in the PL during this week is always an interesting shout. Yet this fixture is even more notable given its top four implications. Champions League is the goal for both sides so this match could have serious implications for the end of the season.   

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Melbourne City vs Melbourne Victory
Match Info: You have to love the A-League, and it’s about time EA do the same. There have been a few other shouts for Australian derbies over the past few weeks, but they have all been snubbed. Maybe it was in anticipation of this tie.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 70 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there tends to be some variance each week, let's take a look at some more outside the box picks that could make their way in:
Bayern vs Dortmund (Cup)
Match Info: The only reason this matchup between the two most prominent temas in Germany is in the sleeper section is because it is a cup match. EA have been a little dicey lately with their Marquee Matchup inclusions, and a cup fixture might not help its chances. However, one can never ignore Der Klassiker.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Monterrey vs Pachuca (Cup)
Match Info: If EA are going to include cup matches, then we turn our attention to Mexico where their domestic tournament comes to a conclusion. The league final wasn’t featured in previous Marquee Matchups, so maybe EA will make amends with this fixture. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from each team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry 


Roma vs Juventus
Match Info: Looking at the top of the table in Serie A, the top four teams are all within five points of the leaders. There’s a lot to play for, and even more for EA to prove. An interesting potential marquee fixture.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Lille vs Nice
Match Info: Ligue 1 snuck into the four fixtures in the current SBC, but there is another rivalry on the horizon. EA have loved these middle of the road fixtures; however, this match has more significance as Lille is fighting relegation. Also, EA might consider after this matchday the French league goes on a three week winter break. 

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 80 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
There’s been some serious left field selections recently, so let's delve into the deep depths this week:
Celtic vs Partick Thistle (a Glasgow Derby)
Investing Strategies
It's that time. Remember to take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team on how to possible make a few coins with would-be Marquee Matchups:

-- Prioritize investing in players who are members of the two teams featuring in a specific Marquee Matchup (higher rated the better)
-- Non-Rare cards usually have a higher return on investment
-- Certain positions such as LB/RB, CMs and STs are generally more profitable*"

FIFA Ultimate Team's big Christmas extravaganza is back for another holiday season.
Following on the heels of last year's SBC-rich two week party, FUT 18 appears set to welcome in a similar edition of 2017's festivities.
Early promotional advertisements promised ""Squad Buildling Challenges, new Prime Icon drops, weekly objectives and other seasonal promotions."" Per EA, that would appear to be the playbook:
3 FUTmas Squad Buildling Challenges every day
From 17 December through 24 December, you'll be able to find three new SBCs in the FUTmas tab of the Squad Building Section of FIFA 18 Ultimate Team as well as on the companion app each and every day (expected currently at 6 p.m. GMT).
""What's the pattern [for player releases] this year?"", you might be asking. Where as last year every player released had the shirt number of the day of the month they were released on, this year's will countdown from 30-1, beginning with Antonio (30), Gnabry (29), and Azpilicueta (28) all the way through numbers 3, 2, and 1 on 24 December.
Here's a list of all FUTmas 18 SBC players released so far:

83 ST Michail Antonio

82 LM Serge Gnabry

86 CB Cesar Azpilicueta 
85 LM Thomas Lemar
86 CB Kalidou Koulibaly
84 RW Domenico Berardi
83 CB Daniele Rugani
86 LW Julian Draxler
86 RM Henrikh Mkhitaryan
86 CM Ander Herrera
83 ST Luis Muriel
82 LW Sofiane Boufal
86 LB Jordi Alba
85 CB Virgil Van Dijk
82 CM Zlatko Junuzovic
84 CM Paulinho
82 CAM Jesse Lingard
81 ST Ahmed Musa
84 RB Thomas Meunier
84 ST Timo Werner
89 ST Zlatan Ibrahimovic
82 RM Romain Alessandrini
84 ST Jamie Vardy
85 CM Naby Keita
86 CB Laurent Koscielny
85 CM Georginio Wijnaldum
87 CM Radja Nainggolan
84 LB Danny Rose
85 CDM Fabinho
90 GK Gianluigi Buffon

FUTmas Weekly Objectives
As has become customary in FIFA 18, Weekly Objectives will play a big part in the FUT 18 FUTmas promo. The first two (whose requirements may vary) seem to emphasize simply playing Squad Battles to unlock an Elf themed kit, or, more challenging (though far more lucrative), score three or more Header goals in Online Single Matches to earn an 82-overall FUTmas Andy Carroll. Think that level of difficulty respectively.
We should see another set next week.
FUTmas themed Kits
As mentioned above, completing Weekly Objectives this week and next could culminate in FUTmas themed kits. The first is live as of the promo's launch, but more are promised to be on the way, and obtainable through means not simply exclusive to objectives.

Are the FUTmas SBCs worth it?
Your mileage may vary, but I'm of the opinion personally that many if not most of the SBCs are worth passing on. Any players that you anticipate will get future in-forms are definitely not worth completing an untradeable Christmas-styled version of, particularly if they're as expensive as the initial set were/are.
If some overpowered/cost-reasonable versions that really and truly upgrade your team come out, those would be the ones I'd point towards as being worth utilizing your investments/monthly rewards on. These promos in general seem targeted at getting coins out of the economy before Team of the Year, assuming it goes forward in January as it does ordinarily."

Hello everyone, and welcome to my second FUT guide!

This is a guide I made for players who want to create a squad in Ultimate Team built around the Bundesliga, aka the German first division.
In this guide I will show you the players you should be aiming to get in every price range you might be, and also a brief analysis of each one of them. You will never have to ask for advice for Bundesliga teams again. 
Keep in mind that this guide is a SUGGESTION. Don't expect it to make you win every single game; this is just squad building advice. 
The guide is organized by collapsed tables, you can press the buttons below to see players from specific positions, along with my reasoning on why you should pick them. 




A few quick notes about this guide:

-- Player prices are based on PS4.
-- All players listed have a Futhead link to their player page, where you can check stats/prices/chemistry effect and also have a button that redirects you to the transfer market in the web app, so you can buy the player immediately if you wish to do so!
-- All position/stat abbreviations are in English. For example: ST-Striker, CB-Center Back, DRI-Dribble.
-- Nationalities, formation and loyalty are not taken into account. If you do a team with all players from the same league, you will get 100 chemistry anyway.

-- Chemistry Styles are very important. If a player has the basic chemistry style, 10 individual chemistry and your team chemistry is 100, he will get a small increase in every stat. However, by changing the chemistry type, you can distribute those stat increases in different ways. Here's a list on every single one of them, just scroll down a bit.
-- Work rates are also really important in high-level squad building. If you don't know what those are, it basically describes the effort your player puts into attacking and defending. For example, a midfielder with ""High/High"" work rates will constantly move into attacking and defending, but will get tired faster than a midfielder with ""Mid/Mid"" work rates.
Alright, on with the guide:
 
 
PRICE RANGES


These are the ranges that best describe the player base of FIFA Ultimate in my opinion.


TierPrice Range Target Player base
Low Cost2k-For new players who just want to start building a cheap squad with 100 chemistry. 
Low-Average Cost2k~10kFor players who want to improve their cheap squad with better and slightly more expensive options. 
Average Cost10k~40kFor players who want to achieve a strong 5* squad. 
High-Average Cost40k~100kFor players who want to start building a very high-overall squad. 
High Cost100k~200kFor players who have reached a point where the only way they can upgrade is by buying the most expensive players available. 
Luxury200k+For players with no budget ceiling. Having these players is indeed a luxury. Informs with small stat upgrades go in here as well.

NameWhy should I pick them?Important StatsRecommended Chemistry 1Recommended Chemistry 2
BoatengIf you want to have a cheap and really strong striker that is still fast and can move the ball around, this is your guy. He's strong, tall, his speed is ok, has good passing and good shot power. Sadly, his balance and stamina are lacking, and you will feel the need to swap him early if you plan on using him as the running tank he is.Shot power, passing, dribbling, strengthHunterHawk
WernerA pure runner. One of the fastest players in the league, he has good finishing to put those through balls in the net. Good dribbling as well, and enough heading, jumping and height to be relevant in the aerial game. However, he is very weak and can't take long shots.Pace, Shooting, DribblingSniperHunter
StindlWell suited for the CF role due to his passing and vision. His shooting stats are great as well for such a cheap player. Unfortunately he's slow and doesn't have a great physique to compensate for that, so he works best when supporting other attackers instead of attacking on his own.Shooting, DribblingMaestroEngine
VollandA cheap well rounded striker. Decent speed and dribbling, good shooting and passing, high strength and stamina, and decent high. Has low heading unfortunately.Shooting, Passing, PhysicalHunterHawk
KramaricCheap 4* skills option with good shooting and dribbling. He is forced into Hunter for being slow however, and he isn't very strong either.Shooting, DribblingHunter-----
IF FinnbogasonWith amazing shooting for his rating, good strength, and ok speed and dribbling, this inform is great. A good player for progressing in the tiers. Has some problems with his heading.Shooting, PhysicalHunterHawk
IF BebouSilver player turned gold. Very fast and agile, with good dribbling and stamina. He's weak and his passes aren't great, but he does what he's meant to do, which is running. Achieves 98 pace with Hunter. Pace, Shooting, Air gameHunterSniper
IF FullkrugAnother silver player turned gold, he's very good for putting the ball in the net when inside the box. With good speed, nice finishing, and great in the air with 93 heading and 89 strength, he's an amazing player for his rating. Has problems with his balance and longshots. Pace, Shooting, Air gameHunterHawk
MullerVery good finishing inside the box, good passes, great on jump balls and 90 stamina. He isn't the slowest of forwards either, but his shooting outside the box could be better, and he isn't very strong for a guy with his size. Dribbling and passing are ok. Overall he is a good player, and great for crossing play.Shooting, Air game, StaminaHawkMarksman
IF WagnerGood inform, he's a crossing play machine. 92 strength, 90 agression, 96 heading, 194cm. Also great finishing inside the box. If you enjoy players that can win headers all day, and be deadly in the air, this is your guy. He can't really do anything else due to being slow with bad passing and dribbling, horrible agility and low stamina. Shooting, Air gameMaestroSniper
IF RaffaelA player suited for a passing and dribbling style of play, with the ability to put the ball in the net either from the inside or outside the box. With low sprint speed, strength and height, but high acceleration, dribbling, and double 4*, he's a good player to create chances with, or finishing them himself.Shooting, Passing, DriblingMaestroSniper
Scream BoatengSome improvements to his pace, shooting and heading, and other small buffs here and there. Unfortunately, his balance and stamina didn't get any improvements, so he still has the same problems. But a good upgrade anyway.Shot power, passing, dribbling, strengthHunterHawk
IF GnabryLM turned ST, this item is great. Amazing speed, great finishing with 91 shot power, good passing and great dribbling. His strength is also good, but for a striker his aerial abilities are quite bad. Better used as strong runner.Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, Physical.HawkSniper
PTG OrigiSignificant improvement to Boateng. Faster with better finishing, dribbling, heading and stamina. Added bonus of auto-upgrading every time he gets a new IF.Pace, Shooting, Passing, Dribbling, Physical.HawkHunter/Marksman
LewandowskiThe complete striker. Great shooting inside and outside the box, good dribbling, great heading, good passes, strong and faster than the usual striker. One of the very best of FIFA 18. EverythingHawkHunter
AubameyangFastest player in the game. Great finishing inside the box, but not much outside of it. His dribbling is good, but not amazing due to the lack of balance and agility. His physical stats are decent, aside from aggression, but he's still a force to be reckon with, and he's very tall.Pace, Shooting, DribblingSniperFinisher/Marksman

FIFA 18's first Throwback Thursday may be a week later than some would've hoped, but the hype is real none the less.
A staggering three maximum rated versions of legendary players of the past come to FIFA Ultimate Team 18 in the form of Alessandro Del Piero, Rui Costa, and Marc Overmars. These best versions of these player items they'll get all FIFA 18 will make for staggering upgrades to your squad -- but they of course won't come cheap.
The Prime Icons are now available in both packs and three intense Squad Building Challenges. Both the SBCs and versions in packs will remain as such for the remainder of FIFA 18. Loan versions of each will be available for just the next week.
The catches would appear to be that the SBC version is untradeable where as the packable version is and the SBCs require any Icon to complete, not merely the specific lesser rated versions of that player.
Throwback Thursday's already had a massive impact on things as the ""Baby"" (e.g. lowest rated) and ordinary version of the Icons are now flying off the transfer market. We'll have to see how things normalize over the weeks to come."

After the departure of Tassal 'Hashtag Tass' Rushan last week, Spencer Owen's Hashtag United were seemingly at a competitive disadvantage in the FIFA esports scene. However, on Tuesday, the club sured that up announcing the signings of former Paris Saint-Germain man August 'Agge' Rosenmeier and Ryan Pessoa in moves that should put them right back in contention with the elites.
The first of the two signings should be a familiar name if you've paid attention to the FIFA 17 Ultimate Team Championships. Rosenmeier was heavily featured in the Paris Regional final as one of the favorites to win from the Xbox One division. He didn't, but came back for Season 2 in Madrid on the PS4 console to only just miss out on the Knockout Stages again.
Before FUT Champions, Agge had already built up an impressive resume. He was a two-time winner of the FIFA Interactive World Cup and a six-time Danish champion. Since, he's made regular appearances at more recent FIWC and other major competitions.
Hashtag's other signing, Ryan Pessoa, is a bit of a lesser known quantity to casuals, but an accomplished player in his own right. Pessoa somewhat slipped under everyone's radar the last few months of FUT Champions qualifying due to the hype surrounding the regional finals and grand final. 
He finished third in May among all European FIFA players and racked up 149 wins, two very impressive feats. Throughout the FIFA 17 cycle, Pessoa also consistently posted top 50 finishes in FUT Champions, with three finishes in Europe's top ten rankings.
Agge and Ryan will join Hashtag's existing esports roster of Harry Hesketh, and Ivan 'BorasLegend' Lapanje as the club set out to make a splash in the FIFA 18 esports cycle with some more marquee tournament wins.

No more daunting 27 man sides to manage in FIFA Mobile.
As of Season 2, you'll be managing a traditional 11 player squad.
Beyond that, while we already knew leveling (aka training) and upgrading your players would be a thing in the new version of the game, Player Rankings, a new paradigm about training and building a team, will come into play as well. 
Since you'll spend the entirety of your season upgrading your players and updating your team, eventually, once you reach a side of all 100-rated players, you'll reach a bit of an artificial ceiling. But with Player Rankings, you'll be able to keep going. Notified in the picture above, as you continue to upgrade your highest ranked players, your squad overall will continue to go up along with it. Sort of like using boosts to go beyond a team's would be squad rating in Season 1.
The S1 ""Pre-Season"" players whose Season 2 bonuses correspond to player rankings are Neymar, Mario Mandzukic, Pizzi, William Carvalho, and Miranda.
Stay tuned for more FIFA Mobile Season 2 news and updates in the weeks to come."

Those social media leaks of discovered web app asset images from earlier this week of FC Porto (and Spain legend) GK Iker Casillas as well as Spartak Moscow's speedy winger Quincy Promes have now found their way to FIFA 18 Ultimate Team.
Casillas becomes the Portuguese La Liga's teal-and-purple league SBC item recipient while Promes represents the Russian Premier League. Following in the footsteps of Ricardo Quaresma for the Turkish Super Lig and for André-Pierre Gignac for Liga MX, it's safe to say future predictions are pretty much off the table with both the players selected and the order of their release essentially random. The last pair were released Wednesday, September 20. Coming three and a half weeks later, our next guess as to what leagues and when are pretty much up in the air.
What you need to obtain Promes and Casillas respectively by completing the SBCs as well as the club challenge rewards involved are now available on Futhead's Squad Buildling Challenges section.
Whether sniping from the transfer market or cashing in on that opportunistic pack hoarding, good luck out there."

Manchester City backers will surely take umbrage with it, but Tottenham's Harry Kane has edged Sergio Aguero as September's Premier League Player of the month. 
For his six goals -- two or more in three consecutive away matches, which had only happened once prior in PL history -- Kane gets the unlockable SBC special item in FIFA Ultimate Team, following Sadio Mane during the season's first month. Aguero had a similarly spectacular five goals and three assists, in one game fewer at that, but his high profile injury in a car accident during a midweek impromptu holiday of sorts may have influenced voters to go with the English top league's Mr. September instead.
Kane's POTM SBC's cost actually winds up a bit surprising. No Spurs, or Kane, for that matter, in-forms are required. Investors would appear to have been a thrown a curve ball yet again. 
With Kane having previously had an 87-overall rated IF, the only real question, especially after some social media leaks Thursday, were what Kane would be rated and how generous his boosts would be. A perennial TOTS and TOTW alike staple, it'll be interesting to see how today's item will influence potential future special items.
Like Mane before him, this SBC will be available for the next several weeks. A 20 match loan version is also available.

The International Break is ordinarily one of the less exciting periods when it comes to FIFA Ultimate Team's Teams of the Week.
Not this time.
With World Cup qualifying reaching a fever pitch, the heroics of the likes of G.O.A.T. Lionel Messi and a pair of Ones to Watch possessing players, Egypt hero Mohamed Salah and Iceland's Gylfi Sigurdsson, see them all get special purple items in FUT this week, the latter two having their OTWs go up in rating as a result.
Spurs (and Denmark's) Christian Eriksen as well as Juventus/France star Blaise Matuidi highlight the rest of the side. Some guy who just became Poland's all-time leading goal scorer, Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski? Well, he gets a high-powered black-and-gold item for his troubles as well.

The 25th Team of the Week from FIFA 18 Ultimate Team has, let's say, give or take seven desirable pack pulls (/s). It's not summer-time ""Team of the Weak"" level bleak, nor is it peak FUT direct-deposit-your-paycheck-straight-into-the-game level enticing, but it's a fun team none the less.
91 Antoine Griezmann is the venerable head turner of the bunch. His best FIFA 18 special player item to date should be a pretty solid table setter for La Liga squads and/or hybrids until he gets his likely blue-and-gold Team of the Season item around May.
89 Thomas Muller, at his old treble-winning position on the right side, is probably the second most enticing item of the week. But with that low pace, outside of moving him to RM with a consumable, he's going to be a tough sell to the sweatiest amongst us. 
Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the week is the three dynamic player items who got in-forms, thus automatically upgrading their Ones to Watch and Path to Glory items respectively. Manchester City keeper Ederson will now be an 87 overall, while Leroy Sane is rapidly approaching his Player of the Month item on his PTG and Mario Gomez is finally a Stuttgart player on his neon colored collectible.

When two of the best teams in the league (including the defending chamipons) lose in the first two matches of the season, you know it's not going to be a great week for predicting. 
This week we are back to normal with four games from European leagues, so hopefully a good score will be back on the cards.
So, let's get into the games.

Manchester United v Liverpool
One of the biggest derbies in world football is played this weekend, but we'll get to that game next. First, we have the small matter of United against Liverpool. 
United seem to find a way to grind out results despite playing horrendously. Their last two games have seen them come from 1-0 and 2-0 down to grab a victory on both occasions. They will be hoping that they can stop that run of conceding soon, with this being the first of three must-win games in a row -- a tough league game v Liverpool on Saturday, the second leg of their Champions League tie against Sevilla on Tuesday and then the FA Cup quarter final against Brighton, in what may be their only chance at silverware this season. 
Liverpool’s 5-0 thrashing of Porto in their Champions League first leg meant that they were able to play a weakened team for their home leg, so will be well rested for this game. They seem to have dropped their reputation of having a leaky defence, with four clean sheets and just three goals conceded in their last six games, and with an average of three goals scored per game, they finally look like a team that is able to compete for silverware, at a stage when the only competition they are still competing in are the league and Champions League. And with their front three all in incredible form, they are a tough side to face. 
United seem to be relying on their home form to keep them in second place, having only lost to Man City at home this season. And with four clean sheets from their last five home matches, they have certainly turned Old Trafford into a fearsome place to play. Liverpool suffered an embarrassing 1-0 loss away to Swansea a few weeks ago, but three clean sheets and convincing wins since have put them in good form to take on their north-east city rivals.
This is a tough one to predict, with the last four games all having ended in a draw. I feel that that run may come to an end, with Liverpool edging out United in an exciting game, as they take advantage of the hosts leaky defence. 
Game played: Saturday 10th, 12:45 p.m. (GMT) / 7:45 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Liverpool win

Rangers v Celtic
As a Scot, I feel like this game is one I should know most about, but it has become much tougher to predict in the past month or so, especially compared to the last few seasons.
Celtic have a six point advantage with a game in hand over their bitter rivals, but their form recently has been poor by their standards, having dropped points to Kilmarnock and St Johnstone in their last league games. Their away form has also been questionable for a while, with four wins and four losses in their last ten away games.
Rangers have found form at the right point in the season, and have won 12 of their last 14 games, losing only to Hibs and drawing away to Celtic in the previous Old Firm. With the recent addition of Jason Cummings on loan from Nottingham Forest, they have added an abundance of goals, with 21 goals in their last five games alone. With seven clean sheets in those 14 games, they have also improved their defence compared to earlier in the season. 
Rangers have failed to beat Celtic since they were demoted, or the new club was formed  - depending on which side of the derby you are on. However, this could be the first time that they blue side of Glasgow comes out on top, with better form and home advantage making the tie much more even than any of the games in the past four years. I feel like they will be successful in stopping Celtic from taking the three points, and I may be going out on a limb, but I think that Rangers may actually pick up all three points.
Game played: Sunday 11th, 12:00 p.m. (GMT) / 7:00 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Rangers win

Inter Milan v Napoli
Fifth host first in Serie A in a game that both teams will be desperate to win.
Inter Milan’s stuttering form at the start of the new year hasn't fully come to an end. With two wins and a loss following on from five draws, they have been able to hold on to the teams currently chasing the last Champions League qualification spots. Their two wins at home has meant that they have still only dropped 11 points at home this season.
Napoli suffered a tough defeat to Roma last weekend, so will be desperate to get back to winning ways to try and keep the pressure up on Juventus, who sit one point behind them with a game in hand. The visitors are in fine away form, and are unbeaten in the league this season, currently have win their last six league games. Having been knocked out of the Europa League by RB Leipzig, Napoli’s main focus will be on the league title.
Napoli edge things in recent years, with four wins to Inter’s two in the past eight meetings, and two wins and one draw in the past three meetings. I am leaning towards an away win in this match due to Napoli's excellent form and their motivation to make amends for last week's loss, while Inter still seem unable to string together a row of gold performances.
Game played: Sunday 11th, 7:45 p.m. (GMT) / 2:45 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Napoli win 

Sevilla v Valencia
Fourth and fifth face off in Spain, with both teams fighting for different European competitions next season. 
Sevilla are currently fifth, and four points ahead of a small pack of teams just behind them, who are waiting to capitalise on any points that they may drop. Sevilla have been on a good run of form which has seen them get five wins and a draw and a loss in their last seven games, with those poor results being a 5-2 home loss to Atletico Madrid and a 0-0 draw with Manchester United in the Champions League. 
Valencia find themselves just one point behind Real Madrid in fourth. Based on the last five games of all teams in La Liga, they are in the best form in the league with three wins and two draws. However their away for is still fairly questionable, having lost four of their last six away games and only beating bottom side Malaga.
In past encounters the home side more often than not prevails, and you have to go back to 2012 to find the last time that either team won while playing away from home. I feel like this game will follow that trend, with Sevilla coming out on top.
Game played: Saturday 10th, 3:15 p.m. (GMT) / 10:15 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Sevilla win

Four very tough games to predict, and the rewards you get out of it are worthwhile. As it is the week of the Old Firm derby, Rangers and Celtic take centre stage with the rewards. Your choice this week is between an 85 Alfredo Morelos and an 85 Scott Sinclair. If neither of those players take your fancy, or you fail to get all four results correct, then you can pick up some coins instead, with 1 token giving you 125k coins and four tokens giving you 950k.
Good luck and happy predicting!"

FIFA 18 has been flying by, and we already find ourselves looking forward to the second Marquee Matchups SBC of March. The first batch of matchups were all solid selections from EA, which demonstrates they have been improving their selection consistency. The pack rewards were still a little spotty, but there is still plenty of hype (and coin making potential) around next Tuesday's release. So, as we approach a time when EA rolled out TOTW Guarantee packs for Marquee Matchups in FIFA 17, let’s delve into the predictions shall we?
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Boca Juniors vs River Plate
Match Info:  Any week that starts with the Superclasico is going to be a good one! One of the most intense derbies in all of football, it would be a shame for this to miss out. Yet, as a cup match, make sure to invest in non-rare discard items to hedge any risk.  

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Olympique Marseille vs Olympique Lyon 
Match Info:  From an extremely intense Argentine derby to a French one that really doesn't have as much bad blood. The “Olympico” is still an high profile match between two very successful clubs, which means it fits the Marquee Matchup selection bill. Plenty of non-rares to go around here, plus Ligue 1 players hold their value relatively well.  

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Fenerbahce vs Galatasaray
Match Info:  We move to Turkey where we make it three huge derbies in a row. A lucky week for us considering these fixtures will be joys to watch, but also could be huge cash cows. Two of the top four teams in the Super Lig leads us to believe this match is marquee in every way. Our only hesitation here is a matchup between Basaksehir vs Besiktas could sneak in and steal their thunder. Regardless, this tie could generate some serious hype, so this might be one to sell into. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Montreal vs Toronto
Match Info: Although it is not a derby anywhere near on the scale of the previous matches, these two Canadian sides faceoff in a heated rivalry. It was also a match selected by MLS in conjunction with Futhead for their kit giveaway contest -- be sure to enter! With the new season just beginning, both teams are trying to establish themselves for the journey ahead. The best return on investment here is probably in high rated non-rares (silvers and golds).
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there tends to be some variance each week, let's take a look at some more outside the box picks that could make their way in:
Villareal vs Atletico Madrid
Match Info:  Shifting to Spain, our pick this week is a top six clash that might just be the right amount of fringe to warrant EA’s selection. The race for European spots is heating up in La Liga Santander, so there’s a lot to play for here. For a match that hasn’t generated as much hype, non-rare golds are the way to go.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Freiburg vs Stuttgart 
Match Info: Unfortunately, this derby gets pushed down due to Bundesliga featuring in the current SBC.That being said, this sleeper is up there with the best of them, and if you can be patient on a couple bids, players from both these teams have great value due to the League SBC.   

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


GFC Ajaccio vs AC Ajaccio
Match Info: Travelling back to France, these two sides from Corsica face off in a crosstown rivalry. Ligue 2 hasn’t got much love this year, a reason for it being a sleeper; however, a match like this could break the pattern. If this match starts getting hype, it might be best to sell into it. 

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 68 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Fulham vs QPR
Match Info: Rounding out the sleepers is a London derby. This Championship tie finds itself at the bottom of the section due to the current Marquee Matchup selection, so that is where we as investors take pause. This could be a tidy matchup to pick up non-rares with the aim of flipping next week. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
Watch out, we hit this last week can we get an encore?!? Well, we’ll pick two derbies to help repeat our performance. 

Lech Poznań vs Lechia Gdansk & Genk vs Standard Liege

Market Overview
The continued Ratings Refresh promotion, sprinkled with a couple Icon SBCs carried the bulk of content from EA this week. With nothing too market breaking, it was actually a rather up and down week across the FIFA Ultimate Team market. The beginning of the week saw the market creep up due to Weekend League demand, but fell pretty sharply over the weekend sell-off  period. Now, it seems to be back on its upward trend as the upcoming Weekend League looms. 
Although the regular FUT market was a little lackluster, the Path to Glory market has exploded back onto the scene. Over the past couple of weeks, we kept saying that the PTG market decline had left some great opportunities, and this week they paid out! A healthy chunk of positive returns, paired with a nice Team of the Week shout means there’s a lot to unpack in the article below. 
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  How the mighty have fallen with Saul as his high/low difference shows the type of potential he has. If you can get in low fro the Spaniard great, but a player on the flip side of that is Giuliano. Currently at his high, that Brazilian could be dropping to a low pretty soon.
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take: A lot of very similar volatility figures across most of the Path to Glory items this week. This speaks to the steady price correction in this sector; however, some notable figures belong to  Marcus Rashford, Kingsley Coman and Dimitri Payet. Each of the preceding players demonstrate sizable hype potential, making them good canadities to flip when they feature in the starting XI.    

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Another section with a majority of similar figures. Again, that was to be expected in the PTG rebound, but  players like Benedikt Howedes, Raphael Varane and Joe Hart come away sporting high numbers. A high beta figure means they’re most likely to experience a sizable price swing in the near future, which means they can be risky items. Yet, you need that risk for some reward.

TOTW & Upgrade Shout 
The main Team of the Week shout goes to Leroy Sane whio put in a quality performance last week in Man City’s win over Arsenal. An alright game versus Chelsea over the weekend hampers his chance a little, but there is still hope.

Although only available through the PTG SBC, which feels like ages ago, Mario Gomez grabbed a brace, so if you have that item, Wednesday could be his lucky day for an upgrade. 
Big Winner -  Leroy Sane  (Manchester City) 
A big week for Manchester City as they are well on their way to a title, and it only gets better as Leroy Sane features as our biggest winner. A solid Team of the Week shout is the main driver behind his 32.4% weekly return; however, there is still plenty to talk about in terms of his outlook. 
An incredibly high volatility figure (~31,000) is supplement by a tame beta (0.37), which is an interesting case for a big winner. Both of the previous statistics are risk metrics, so it would seem like they are conflicting, yet this is not the case as volatility speaks to how much his price can fluctuate on a daily basis, while beta speaks to how likely those fluctuations are supposed to happen. 
So, watch out for Sane’s price to dip heavily if he misses on that TOTW, but stay stable if he features. Going forward, Manchester City still has quite a few fixtures and if they continue their form it's only a matter of time before Sane can snag an inform. 

Big Loser - Divock Origi (Wolfsburg)
Another tough year for Wolfsburg, and although there has been some bright spots, this week isn’t one of them as their Belgian striker, Divock Origi finds himself as a our biggest loser. A rough weekly return of -15.6% lands the Liverpool loanee here, but is there a silver lining here?
Breaking down his other weekly stats, a tame volatility (~2,900) and beta (-0.01) mean Origi’s decline can be attributed to a natural decline considering the bleak outlook of his teams performances. Yet, these low figures also suggest that his price should be stabilizing after this week, so could this be a nice investment?
As always, a large decline in price makes an item more affordable, and in Origi’s case this could  be a nice opportunity. His stats suggest that he shouldn’t drop too much further, and a second inform could give his PTG item a quality upgrade. The possibility of pairing him and Michy Batshuayi up top means there is sizable hype potential here.
. 
Recap
Looking back, the Path to Glory market finally rebounded after we had been mentioning stabilization for a couple weeks. This price correction is nice, but next week, bar any serious events, means these items might dip a little. So going forward, make sure you’re investing in either high hype potential items, or 82/83 rated items close to discard. This will help keep your risk low, but also position you for solid returns. On the horizon, we should have St. Patrick's Day and FUT Birthday promos to look forward to, so expect some big news potentially then.
Could we see PTG items needed for the next Premier League POTM SBC? Just a theory, but if you have some, glad to entertain them in the comments below.

Hey comrades, welcome back to my FIFA 18 academy! Today we’re mixing things up a little, so instead of examining a gameplay mechanic, we’re taking an in depth look at one of the most overused players and finding the best way to play with him.
That’s right, we’re getting holy with Gabriel Jesus:

As always, there’s a video portion to this guide available above as well as on my YouTube channel.
My experience with Jesus
I’ve used him a striker, both as central and on either side. I’ve tried all of the available player instructions, except for target man since he’d be awful that.
Currently, he’s on 88 matches with 77 goals and 44 assists.
Gabriel Jesus’ Base Attributes - Pros And Cons
On paper, Jesus is a machine for an 81-rated card. He’s fast, agile, composed, has good ball control/dribbling, great stamina, and decent finishing. Plus he’s got four-star skills and a four-star weak foot. 
However, he’s super small and weak, and his passing, shot power and long shots are poor. His positives outweigh the negatives, but the negatives combine in such an awkward way that take some getting used to. 
Jesus has High/High work rates, which hurt and help depending on your playstyle. Let’s dig deeper!
Jesus is a solid scorer, but his timing is very specific
Due to his decent finishing but crummy shot power, you might find yourself underpowering or overpowering his shots often. As a result, Jesus can feel inconsistent at times.
You might score a world class goal in one attack, but in the next you might miss from eight yards. The timing window for how much power to add and how drastically to aim is too specific if you’re looking for a player that you don’t really have to think about.
Furthermore, his inability to bang in long shots limits how you can play him. Defenders will know that they don’t have to fear Jesus too much when he’s far from the box. And due to his timing being so specific, finesse shots that aren’t driven tend to be too precise to pull off.
Jesus relies heavily on having a good line of sight to goal.
Jesus is fast and versatile, but not the dribbler you want him to be
Funnily enough, Jesus is more agile than Messi on paper, and has similar balance. Wonderful! Right? Riiiight?!
Not exactly.
Although you can send Jesus on blistering runs or quickly dart around the pitch with him, he still feels stiff on the ball. A guy like Messi has all sorts of animations that make it easy to beat defenders with close control or fast skill moves. A guy like Jesus has the “regular” animations which are nowhere near as effective. His skill moves are wildly inconsistent, despite his high attributes and four stars.
Sometimes they come out super fast. Sometimes they come out super slow. It very much depends on what the defender is doing. If the defender is rushing blindly, Jesus will skill his way out of trouble with ease. But if you’re being blindly rushed, you didn’t really need a skill move or super close ball control to begin with, right? Just good reaction time. The difference between Jesus and someone like Messi is that Messi can pull shit out of his ass no matter what the defender is doing, whereas Jesus’ animations require an optimal scenario for them. Also,Jesus is easy to bully off the ball inside the box. He doesn’t do well in crowds.
With that said, it’s undeniable that he has an excellent burst of pace, which is often more important for a striker than just sprint speed. Since his H/H work rates will often see him come a little deeper, his acceleration is fantastic because he’s able to shift roles quickly, from striker to creator. And that’s Jesus’ biggest strength, outside of turning water into wine.
Jesus is a jack of all trades, but a master of none
Keep in mind that although Jesus can switch between finisher and creator on the fly, he’s not amazing at either. He gets the job done but he won’t make you're steering an overpowered beast.
His passing range is poor and limits him as a creator. You can make lots of little passing moves and triangles, but his medium length passing is questionable. And his long range passing blows.
Before swearing yourself to Jesus, ask yourself, “Do I need a very specialized player in my squad, or someone who’s decent at everything?”
Of course, you can always apply a specific chemistry card to him, but his stats are so all around that he still won’t feel “amazing” with any of the boosts.
My final score and recommendations for using Jesus in FIFA 18

Play Jesus as striker, whether alone or not.
Leave his instructions on default or change him to a False 9 that goes wide (good for link up play with CAMs/wingers).
Don’t put him on get in behind because his H/H work rates get in the way.
Pair him with a good passer, whether as a second striker or someone behind him, in order to maximize the usefulness of Jesus’ pace.
Don’t ever rely on his long shots or physicality.
Work him into the box with short quick passing or fast through/driven balls.

I give Jesus three stars out of five (no half stars). It’s very useful to have an all around player like him if the rest of your team can cover for the fact that he’s not great at anything. He’ll always be a decent option in this game because of his versatility.
However, as of this writing (October 2017) he’s super expensive and goes for over 60,000 coins. That’s simply not worth it. He’ll be much cheaper in about a month.

Anyway comrades, that’s it for today, hope it’s been helpful! If you have any questions, comments, or ideas about Jesus, let me know in the comments below.

In a relative surprise, Manchester, England, United Kingdom will host the 2018 Spring Cup for the FUT Champions series. Other prominent European cities had been rumored as possible hosts, but EA announced the finalization of the new location and time/schedule Thursday.
The 2018 FUT Champions Spring Cup (officially coined FUT Champions Cup Manchester) will take place from 13 April-15 April with another $200,000 USD in total prizes on the line for 128 qualified competitors (64 per console).
Following on the heels of his big breakout win in Barcelona, 16-year-old wunderkind DhTekKz will look to repeat along with a pool competitors expected to include usual favorites like Gorilla, Kurt, FaZe Tass, the Hashtag United pro players and many more.
The format will again be the Swiss one in which seven rounds of seeded gameplay give way to a 32-player-per-console two-leg knockout round. ""Road"" goals are once again a thing of the past, with even on the cross-console Grand Final, aggregate-score ties will be broken by golden goal and then penalties if need be.
After the hiccups of the first tournament, a bit of recalibration is to be expected. But even with some of the stumbles of the first weekend back in January, a worthy champion was still crowned in exciting fashion. Should that momentum continue, the FUT Champions Cup Manchester could be one of the best competitive FIFA tournaments yet.
You'll be able to follow all the action from Futhead as well as on Twitch."

The worst kept secret in FIFA 18 in perhaps two weeks is now a reality. Liverpool's Mohamed Salah is the EA SPORTS Premier League Player of the month for a second time this season.
Salah helped The Reds to a 2 win 1 draw record in the month of February in league play and in the process accounted for four goals and two assists. Last month's winner, Manchester City's, Sergio Aguero, was also in the mix with an identical record and four goals to his name, but couldn't equal the total number of goals the Egyptian had a hand in.
On the Ultimate Team side of things, Salah gets his second purple-and-gold untradeable in-form item this FIFA. We wouldn't rule out another in-form or perhaps a Man of the Match between now and late April/early May's expeccted PL Team of the Season, but it's not impossibe this is Salah's penultimate (at least Pre-World Cup) FUT special item. Food for thought if you're considering whether or not the coin sink is worth it or not.
The untradeable Squad Buildling Challenge unlockable item (requirements available here) is obtainable now for the next week and change. A loan version is also available at a marginal cost as well for the same time period."

The final incarnation of the FIFA 18 Ultimate Team ""Ratings Refresh"" is in the books. 
This release, a massive one spanning the so-called ""Rest of the World"", essentially all the leagues omitted from the previous ones to point, probably isn't going to get you to empty your wallet. There are a couple names of note, however, including FC Porto's Yacine Brahimi, Benfica's Jonas, Fenerbahce's Giuliano, former MLS MVP Sebastian Giovinco of Toronto FC, and FUT 18 Meta left-back Alex Telles.
The Rest of the World doesn't include the previous leagues' SBCs since, well, there isn't exactly one targeted league here. There still may be special packs tomorrow as things wind down and the game gets ready for the next round of promos for what's usually a sneaky busy March (amongst them FUT Birthday, Saint Patrick's Day).

Another Premier League pink special item could be making its way to FUT 17.
After Manchester City's rising German winger Leroy Sane, one of the tournament-only obtainable TOTS recipients from FIFA 16 Ultimate Team, took home the vote for Favourite RM/RW, a pair of English left backs now look to join the fray.
Tottenham's Danny Rose inexplicably didn't get a special item (other than an upgrade) this past entire season. And while he was battling back from injury (and falling out of favor with boss Jose Mourinho), Manchester United's Luke Shaw didn't either. They're joined in the vote by Valencia's Jose Gaya. Given the usual Premier League popularity, the latter will face a bit of an uphill battle to say the least.
You can check out the upgraded Sane's stats below and what his SBC will take to complete here:

A Barcelona-heavy ""Ratings Refresh"" from Spain's top league, La Liga Santander, is official.
CDM Sergio Busquets, LB Jordi Alba, and keeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen are joined by transfer deadline acquisition Philippe Coutinho in moving up to 87-overall in a Barca led batch of Winter upgrades. No Lionel Messi and no Samuel Umtiti, however, unfortunately.
Casemiro's bump up to 86 overall surely will go noticed by many but there's not much star-power to be found otherwise in this group. Ostensibly we're looking at the Rest of the World upgrades come Monday and then it's on to the next promo (St. Patrick's Day or FUT Birthday are surely just on the horizon).

With FIFA 18’s launch date drawing nearer and nearer, YouTuber and former EA Sports FIFA community manager Chu “ChuBoi” Morah has helped pass the time by releasing weekly player prediction videos. Each episode lasts around 10 minutes and offers viewers Chu’s opinions on how each team’s players will fare with ratings next season. In past episodes, Chu has predicted the player ratings for world renown teams such as Manchester United, Barcelona, and Real Madrid. This time he tackles Germany's ""Record Champions"", Bayern Munich.
The German club had a solid 2016/17 campaign under new manager Carlo Ancelotti, who was hired after the departure of now Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola. Upon arrival, Ancelotti gave his input on a few signings to improve the squad. The German club's braintrust brought in Portuguese prodigy and FUT 17 favorite Renato Sanches along with pre-contract signing Mats Hummels. With these new additions, Bayern Munich was able to secure another Bundesliga title. However, the season felt a bit underwhelming after being knocked out of the Champions League in the quarter-finals by Real Madrid. Sanches seldom featured too and could be on the move again now.
All in all, Bayern Munich had a superb season, but how will it affect their FUT 18 ratings? Chu's inclined to think that Hummels will get a boost while the oft injured last season Jerome Boateng will be downgraded. He also believes that Joshua Kimmich could get a big-time upgrade along with new signing Corentin Tolisso. 
Worth noting: Chu issued this video before Bayern pulled off perhaps the coup of the summer, signing James Rodriguez on loan with an option to buy from Real Madrid.
So what do you think? Are Chu's Bayern Munich FIFA 18 rating forecasts in line with yours?

According to the EA Online Services page, there a bunch of service shutdowns on their way, across 2 seperate days.
On the 15th of September the once famous Creation Centre site will be taken offline. Creation Centre launched in the middle of the Xbox 360/PS3 cycle and allowed PS3 and Xbox 360 players to create teams (complete with customisable sponsors and badges!), players and tournaments. 
An initial wave of excitement and possibility was chilled as the years rolled on by a lack of development or support from EA and now it's going away for good, although EA have noted that you'll still be able to download any assets that you have flagged once the website is taken down, you just won't be able to create anything new.
Perhaps more newsworthy is the server shutdown for FIFA 14, which is due on October the 18th 2017 for all platforms, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 360, Xbox One and PC, and obviously takes with it, access to Ultimate Team, meaning your only access to your FIFA 14 players will be through generations, so make the most of the time you have left if you're still enjoying FUT 14.

The server shutdown for FIFA 14 also means that the game will be removed from EA Access on the same day. If you already have it downloaded from the vault then you'll still be able to load it, but the online features will be disabled."

The final FIFA 17 Team of the Season is almost here.
Expected in the lead up to the August 2, 2017 MLS All-Star Game, these players will line up against back-to-back European champions Real Madrid in Chicago as well as get the last blue items of FUT 17:

Player ratings/positions/etc will be determined by EA's FIFA 17 production team at a later date and time.
It remains to be seen what all the latest TOTS will incorporate, but based on recent histories, an unlockable player through the weekly (or biweekly) Daily Knockout Tournament is likely as are possible untradeable and tradeable Squad Building Challenges. The SBCs during the six previous TOTS were some of the most fun of this year's game.
Worth keeping in mind that late injury replacements are customary. During the last two MLS TOTS, EA's been pretty good about adding injury replacements even as late as the day before the All-Star game."

While not exactly sexy -- okay, okay; admittedly pretty far from it -- a second straight Throwback Thursday means more Prime Icons (and their accompanying Untradeable and Loan Squad Buildling Challenges).
These two aren't many most were asking for, but rest assured, a few out there will find 91 Andriy Shevchenko and 91 Edwin van der Sar to their likings. Shevchenko was the first Icon (then Legend) I personally ever packed in a FIFA, and while limited by his speed back then, looks kind of okay if not borderline good with 88 PAC as a 91-overall, no?
And while some are probably set with the likes of a Special David De Gea or holding out for hopes for a Manuel Neuer special item around World Cup time, a number of pros at this past month's Barcelona FUT Champions Winter Cup swore by the 89 van der Sar as their goalkeeper of choice. Just imagine the 91.
As per usual, the Shevchenko untradeable Prime Icon SBC is available now for the remainder of the game, while a 20-match loan version is available for a limited time (just the next week). The same is true for van der Sar, as you can check out his Prime Icon SBC and loan one as well. Both Prime Icons are also packable (in a tradeable item form) for the remainder of FUT 18.
Which Prime Icons would you like to see next?"

It always feels nice coming off a week when you hit on 4/4 Marquee Matchups predictions. Unfortunately, attempting to go toe-for-toe with EA's SBC folks can be a cruel mistress, and in the next week, our fates could be completely reversed. However, we like to think that some careful research, as well as some gut feelings, can help combat this. So, lets ride the wheel of fortune in this week’s predictions. 
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to happen:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Borussia M'gladbach vs Borussia Dortmund
Match Info:  A huge rivalry in the Bundesliga kicks us off this week. The two sides from Borussia square off in an upper table clash that should be quite the fixture. Look to non-rares here and lets all hope we see a TOTW 22 in-form from this tie (Pulisic?!).
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Torino vs Juventus
Match Info:  Just a hop, skip and jump away in Italy a big inner city rival headlines their match week. The Turin teams matchup in a game that is extremely important for The Old Lady as they push for the title. Another matchup where the non-rares will be low risk picks means it’s definitely one to consider. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 2 to 3 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Bohemian vs Shamrock Rovers
Match Info:  Ireland sees its domestic league kickoff in this cycle, and that news coupled with this rivalry has us feeling good about this pick. Both teams sport some silver options, so we would stick to those as best you can. Low risk and high reward could be the case here.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 68 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Lyon vs Lille
Match Info: A “mini-classico” to the French, this game should be another entertaining watch in-real life. Plenty of young talent, as well as vital points to play for. Ligue 1 prices hold value extremely well making this high on the list for investing.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
As there tends to be some variance each week, let's take a look at some more outside the box picks that could make their way in:
Vitoria SC vs Braga
Match Info: Liga Portuguesa makes another appearance after a brief break, but this rivalry makes a compelling case. EA always look to add a little diversity, and this could be just sidestream enough for that. Make sure to stick to non-rare golds here though.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Young Boys vs FC Thun
Match Info: Turning to Switzerland, this rivalry also just misses out on being a main pick due to EA’s tendency to pick oddballs. It was a difficult choice between this, and Sion vs Lausanne, but either way a look into some non-rare silvers in this league could pay off big.  

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Ipswich vs Norwich
Match Info: After missing out last week, we take a shot at an English Championship matchup again. With the PL clubs off due to other cups and such, it might be a prime week for EA to select from England lower leagues. Plenty of non-rare options here, and regardless these items should hold value due to the League SBC. 

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Wisla Krakow vs Arka Gdynia
Match Info: Lets try another part of the Great Triad vs the Kings of the Big Cities derby, maybe this week is its time to shine? 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 70 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 85 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
We’ve picked a couple rivalries the past two weeks for this spot, so to spice it up we’re targeting a lower league promotion battle.
Empoli vs Parma
Investing Strategies
It's that time. Remember to take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team on how to possibly make a few coins with would-be Marquee Matchups:

-- Prioritize investing in players who are members of the two teams featured in a specific Marquee Matchup (the higher rated, the better).
-- Non-Rare cards usually have a higher return on investment.
-- Certain positions such as LB/RB, CMs and STs are generally more profitable."

It certainly isn't the sexiest of Man of the Match drops, and yet it's Friday night in North America, so we're getting some fresh, hot content whether we want it or not.
If you're a hyper MLS partisan and want a taste of what a potential Andre Blake TOTS may look like, you're getting it. The Jamaican keeper gets an 80, his highest rated in any edition of FIFA Ultimate Team ever. The USA's Jordan Morris, he of the 99-overall ""Golden Ticket"" item in FIFA Mobile, gets his best console special item to boot. For a thoroughly unimpressive 3-2 win over semi-pros from Martinique, that's not too bad of spoils.
If you're of Mexican or Costa Rican descent, perhaps we can interest you in an Elias Hernandez or Marcos Urena? Maybe? No? Bueller?
These items may not tickle the fancy of anyone but the most hardcore FUT fanatical collectors still going strong, but either way, they're available in packs until next Friday, July 21.
Happy hunting."

Well, last week couldn’t have gone any worse.
Late goals in three of the games, along with Boca Juniors not being able to win against nine men meant we managed a miserable 0/4 last week. At least this week things can’t get any worse this week as we try and predict another set of four fixtures being played this weekend.

Spurs v Arsenal
Spurs feature for the second week in a row as they face bitter rivals Arsenal in the North London derby.
Spurs were lucky to extend their unbeaten run to 10 games last week, with two controversial penalties -- one being saved and the other scored -- to help them to a 2-2 draw against Liverpool. They rested the majority of their key players for their midweek cup replay against Newport, clearly with this game in mind. Their recent away form may be what is costing them from challenging for the title, but at home they are still an almost unbeatable force with just two losses at home all season -- a 2-1 loss against Chelsea in the second week of the season and a half-team being defeated 3-2 by West Ham in the EFL Cup. 
Arsenal’s away form hasn’t been much better than their opponents, having picked up just 13 points from 13 away games this season. However, three convincing wins, with a 3-1 defeat to Swansea in between, has seen their attacking flare come back to life. With the additions of the former Dortmund duo of Aubameyang and Mkhitaryan, they are certainly not to be written off in away games now.
The past two times these sides have met, the home side has come out with the three points. Spurs should be well rested despite their midweek fixture, but with a game away to Juventus just three days later, they will need to be at their peak twice in quick succession if they wish to keep their unbeaten run going. Arsenal’s new attack may appear to have gelled quickly, but how they are able to cope against a good defence like Spurs remains to be seen.
Game played: Saturday 10th, 12:30 p.m. (GMT)/7:30 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw

Napoli v Lazio
First meets third in Italy with both sides desperately needing a win.
Napoli have won eight of their last nine games, and their last seven in the league -- only losing when fielding a weakened team against Atalanta in the Coppa Italia. With 15 goals scored and just 4 conceded in those seven league games, they are in fine form and doing well to hold off Juventus, who are just one point behind them and are also on a seven game winning streak in the league.
Lazio managed to take third place away from Inter Milan a couple of weeks ago, but have since lost twice in a row to AC Milan and Genoa. They desperately need to turn around their form if they want to try and keep ahead of the chasing pack and in the Champions League qualification spots. Their away form this season has only been bettered by Napoli and Juventus, so they will be hoping they are able to find that form once again.
You have to go back to 2015 to find the last time Lazio beat Napoli, with Napoli being victorious in four of the latest five matches. I can’t see Napoli losing this game either, and with their form being as good as it is, a home win is looking fairly likely.
Game played: Saturday 10th, 7:45 p.m. (GMT)/ 2:45 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Napoli win

Bayern Munich v Schalke
Runaway league leaders Bayern face up against a Schalke side dreaming of Champions League action for the first time since 2014/15.
Bayern are firm favourites going into the game, as they are for almost every game. One loss and one draw in their last 23 games shows just how unstoppable they have been, especially when you consider that Manuel Neuer has been out injured for that whole period. 20 goals scored and five conceded in their five games in 2018 makes it look like no one will be able to stop them from winning their eighth consecutive league title.
Schalke started 2018 in second place, 11 points behind their opponents. However a run of bad results has seen them drop to fifth in a very close battle between seven teams. As the second team in the chasing pack to play Bayern in Rückrunde, they will know that all of their rivals still have to play the Bavarian giants so this could be a chance to pick up some extra, unexpected points.
The last time Schalke managed to beat Bayern was back in 2011, so they will be hoping to end that seven year streak, but I can't see that happening this weekend. 
Game played: Saturday 10th, 5:30 p.m. (GMT)/12:30 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Bayern win

Tigres v Club America
First place in the apertura meets the current second place in the clausura in Liga MX in what should be a very good game.
Tigres edged out the league table toppers Monterrey 3-2 on aggregate to take home the Apertura crown, but not find themselves down in 8th place after five games. Although they have had a fairly poor start to the season, they can rely on their home form to help them pick up points, with two wins from two so far in the Clausura.
Club America are just one goal scored behind the league leaders Monterrey. With three wins and two draws so far, they are in good form, and will be very high in confidence after thrashing bottom side Lobos 5-1 last weekend. They will be hoping that new signing Jérémy Ménez can help them keep up their good form and add some more goals to their game.
With Tigres being at home, where they have been in fairly good form in recent months, and Club America not exactly being a strong force away from the Estadio Azteca, I can see this game being very close and a draw certainly wouldn’t be a surprising result.
Game played: Sunday 11th, 1:00 a.m. (GMT)/Saturday 10th, 8:00 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw

That’s what I think will happen this week. Hopefully we can be a bit more successful than some other recent weeks and help you get your hands on the special Allan Matchups card, which will come in very handy for some of the future Brazilian Icons that we can hope will be released at some point soon. Instead of coins, training XP or Skill boosts this week, you can trade your tokens in for some gold or better Scouting players to help improve your team directly or as XP for boosting your current players. One token will give you three players, while four will give you 15, so there’s a much greater chance of getting the likes of Asensio, Rashford or a lower rated beast like Sarr.
As always, good luck and happy predicting!"

Bayern Munich's Thiago Alcantara and the once-extinct-Silver gem of FUT 18 Cristiano -- no, not that Cristiano -- from Japanese side Kashiwa Reysol are your new League Squad Building Challenge players. 
Just like in the other League SBC releases to this point, there doesn't appear to be any real rhyme or reason as to why the particular players chosen were selected (though Cristiano does make for some good FIFA 18 meta, certainly).
If you've been stocking up on German Bundesliga or Meiji Yasuda J.League full squads in anticipation, is this ever the weekend for you. While Winter Ones to Watch players are no longer in packs, with a decent Team of the Week 21 available and some enticing rewards ever present in this latest release of League SBCs, you can either sell your German and Japanese League players for a pretty penny, or build the teal-and-purple player items of your dreams while concurrently stacking packs for the next promo that fits your fancy.
These two latest SBCs are available for the remainder of FIFA 18."

EA have just announced that FIFA Mobile version 6.2 is in the process of being rolled out, so what exactly is included?
As with most of the recent update, it is primarily gameplay based, with fixes to several bugs and annoyances that you may have spotted while playing recently. These include: 

Fixed an issue with players being frozen and unresponsive at the beginning of a possession
Fixed an issue with swipes to shoot sometimes being ignored
Tuned corner possessions and player positions
Tuned how fast possessions end when the player no longer has the ball

Along with this, they have made a few big changes that will change the way you play.

-Tuned Great Chances to make sure higher success rate. Moved players closer to the net and give easy passing option
-Tuned Good chances by creating more space and clearer passing options
-Fixed issues where Dribbler was immediately pressured on possession start
-Reduced the length of Attack Mode matches from 2:00 to 1:30
-Added the option to toggle Auto-Play
-Changed the Tactic Selection screen to a single list sorted by highest OVR
-Fixed some issues with changing tactics failing to persist into gameplay
-Fixed an issue causing matches to end while the player still had time left
-Fixed an issue where the wrong information appeared on the screen while waiting for your opponent to finish their match
-Many other fixes and performance improvements

Shortening the length of Attack Mode matches by 30 seconds will be an interesting change, seemingly making matches a much more involved experience with heightened pressure and need to make the most of your time on the ball; while the change in Tactic selection should enable you to choose your desired formation much more efficiently without struggling to find your best non-countered formation
How do you feel about these changes? Do they fix any of the major issues that you have been struggling with?"

Another really solid round of predictions from Aaron leaves us with just five measly players to investigate for TOTW 21. But, one of the key things we did miss were the goalkeepers, with both of TOTW 21's stoppers finding their way in to the Unpreditables. So, lets find out why we missed the goalkeepeing heroics around the globe this week. 
Rony Lopes – LM – Monaco
Monaco are now unbeaten in 9 Ligue 1 matches after their hard fought 3-2 win against Lyon for which they played the entire second half with 10 men after Keita saw red just before half time. It looked like Falcao’s missed penalty prior to that was going to cost Monaco all three points until Rony Lopes slammed home the winner in the 87th minute. Just a solitary goal for the IF here, but a very crucial one at that. 
Aaron's View: Three midfielders got an 8/10 from L’equipe this week (Gradel, Cabella and Lopes) and all three of them scored a single goal making it very difficult to predict.
Federico Chiesa – LW – Fiorentina
Fiorentina recorded their first win in four in Serie A on Sunday away to Bologna, where another single goal from a winger would be enough to secure the IF. Federico Chiesa (son of legend Enrico Chiesa - thanks for the Championship Manager memories) scored the goal with a swish of his left foot in the 70th minute. Due to the single goal this is yet another tough IF to pick-up on the predictions. 
Aaron's View There was a major lack of Calcio A options this week which looks to have helped Chiesa, but I'm going to stick with my Khedira decision, who picked up two goals and an assist over Chiesa's singular goal.
Alban Lafont – GK – Toulouse
Toulouse made it back to back wins in Ligue 1 on Saturday thanks to a strike from Max Gradel in the 67th minute. But the inform instead goes to Alban Lafont who picked up his second clean sheet in a row the league. Just the two saves in this one however makes him a very difficult option to pick-up. 
Aaron's View: With keepers being a hard position to select this week, Lafont was always a potential option after claiming 7/10 from L’equipe and featuring as their keeper of the week. The deciding factor for me was that Gradel was also in the side with a better rating of 8/10.
David Da Costa – GK – FC Lugano
We take a rare trip to the Swiss Super League now where FC Lugano put in an impressive performance to beat FC Basel 1-0 away from home. Alexander Gerndt scored the early goal but David Da Costa gets a deserved IF after saving Mohamed Elyounoussi’s penalty some 20 minutes later. Penalty save + clean sheet + beating a big team = TOTW 21. 
Aaron's View: A penalty save against the league leaders Basel was enough for Da Costa and I probably should have taken a punt on this one, but with the Swiss league regularly overlooked for the TOTW, I didn't.
Cameron Dummigan – RB –  Oldham Athletic
After a nine-game winless run, Oldham Athletic find themselves in a relegation dogfight in League 1. But, there was a glimmer of hope for a return to form as they recorded a decent 2-1 win against a Bradford side stuck in the middle of a slump of their own, losing 5 on the bounce. Right back Dummigan opened the scoring on Saturday and that’s enough for the N.Irishman to make TOTW 21. 
Aaron's View: Dummigan scored but without a clean sheet or a spot in the ELL TOTW this is basically impossible predict."

Those sneaky late Friday/early Saturday FIFA 18 Ultimate Team content dumps are back.
This time, after a week of action in the German DFB-Pokal, England's FA Cup, Spain's Copa del Rey, and the Belgian Cup, we get five shiny new orange special items from a range of teams represented in those.
One of Spurs' goal scorers, the versatile Erik Lamela, gets an intriguing position change to CAM. His lack of pace probably will limit him outside the most ardent Argentina/Tottenham backers' sides, but he's an interesting collectors' item none the less.
Arjen Robben headlines the release arguably after his missile strike for Bayern in their emphatic 6-0 win over lower league Paderborn. His 89 RM orange player item looks to be superficial at best, but it'd make for a great pack pull if you're lucky enough to do so.
Rounding out the group is Sevilla's Franco Vazquez, Swansea's rising star Tammy Abraham, and Genk's Ibrahima Seck. You can check out all the latest editions to FIFA in Futhead's latest players section."

Today we'll be reviewing the new FUTTIES Winner Jack Butland.

Surely to everyone's suprise, the Stoke City and England keeper managed to beat PSG's Kevin Trapp and fellow BPL goalkeeper Asmir Begovic, and has secured this 86-rated FUTTIES Winner SBC item.
The SBC is relatively easy to complete,  so don't be shocked to see him in 28 of the 30 Weekend League games you play next weekend.
Squad
I used Butland in the following squad:

Stats
I used Butland for 12 games in the WL, and here are the stats after these games:
Games: 12
Goals/Assists: 0/0 (TBH he did play as goal keeper, so it's not a bad return)
Goals conceded: 15
Clean sheets: 5
Review
I think my experience with FUTTIES Winner Butland can be summed up with his performance in the first game I used him in. He struggled to catch my opponents first shot on target, and celebrated catching it by taking a huge step back into his own net. He then attempted to punch the ball clear, but only hit it as far as the back of Chris Smalling's head, and then lay hopelessly on the ground as the ball rolled into the back of my net. 
Finally, he decided that the best course of action in the 90th minute, when I was 3-2 up, was to come charging out at an on-rusing Heung-Min Son, and then throw himself at his feet, only for Son to coolly step past him, and try to dribble the ball into the net (Smalling came up big and tackled him from behind to make the clearance, and secure me the win).
The first thing you should notice in his stats is that in the 12 games he played, he kept 5 clean sheets, but still conceded 15 goals. This equates to him conceding 15 goals in just 7 games, including one game where he let in 5 goals (I won that game 7-5 in extra time, but if it had not been for a lot luck, I would have conceded at least 5 more). That is a shocking statistic, especially for a goalkeeper of Butland's notoriety. He would somehow scrape a cleansheet in one game, and then let in two in the next.
In real-life football, most saves go something like this:  the keeper sees the opponent lining up for the shot, anticipates where it will go, decides on the best way to save it, and then executes that save.
This 86-rated Butland did things a little differently.
He added an extra step to the process -- right after he saw the shot, he took a moment to make a crucial decision. He decided whether he's going to play like the Jack Butland we all know and love, or if he was going to forget everything he ever learned about being a keeper. If he chose the latter, he'd stick out the wrong arm, or dive the wrong way, or just drop to the pitch and pretend he's somewhere else.
I'm not saying this is something that Butland is alone in doing. Goalkeeping was pretty broken this year; the mechanics, decision-making and animations are inconsistent and unreliable, with keepers pulling off unbelievable reflex saves while being unable to get down to stop a pea-roller. This is why there are so many differing opinions on goalkeepers this year -- I know people who swear by Alex McCarthy from Southampton, as well as those who have found TOTS David De Gea to be useless. 
There are a handful of keepers who are less prone to these bouts of stupidty, with the rest of them being virtually unusable. Butland's 82-rated item was one of those handful of keepers. That's the reason he was (and still is) a mainstay of Weekend League teams, and the reason why he holds his goalkeeping spot against so many higher-rated keepers. 
This 86-rated item, at least in the games I used him, was a completely different story. He was awful. I'm not going to sugarcoat it: there are no words for how disappointed I was.
One of the only good things I can say about this item was that he was consistent in his performances -- consistently awful, that is. Even the games in which he kept clean sheets, he was lucky to not concede; off-the-line clearances, shots coming off the woodwork, and some of the least clinical finishing I've seen this year were some of the reasons he didn't concede twice as many as he did.
He did make some impressive saves, but they were few and far between. What really got to me was these super saves often came in the back end of games where he had already conceded many goals, or in games where I was so many goals ahead that it didn't matter. However, when the chips were down, he rarely delivered.
I would go through his item stats, by there is no point in doing that, because we all know keepers rarely perform to their stats. His diving was especially bad, with this item being completely incapable of stopping low shots. He was also incapable of stopping shots that went close to his body, preferring to flap his arms and go to ground. His reflexes were still very good, allowing him to pull off some wonder saves from close range, and he was pretty much unbeatable from outside the box. His handling was garbage, and he spilled more shots than he caught. His positioning was equally trash; there were times when he was so far away from the ball that he wouldn't have been able to reach it even if he dived. His kicking was solid, probably because of all that practice from kicking the ball out of his own net.
I'm fully aware that this review doesn't make a lot of sense. How can an 86-rated version be worse than an 82-rated version?  Personally, I think it comes down to two factors: The first was that I was expecting so much from him; Butland's 82-rated item may be the best keeper I've used this year (besides Van der Sar), and this 86-rated item has received a significant boost, so I was expecting him to be a game-changer. Second, I have always viewed the 82-rated item with rose-tinted glasses, often overlooking his mistakes because he was so darn good. But with this item, I just didn't experience that magic, and so I couldn't sweep his issues under the rug. Maybe if I went back to his 82-rated, I'd notice these deficiencies, but after this experience, I'm not using Butland again this year.
I'm sure that other people will have different experiences with him, which is why I wish EA released an option to try him out on loan. But based on my experience, I would suggest you save those coins and items for another FUTTIES SBC.
Rating
Overall: 2/10
Value for Coins: 4/10 (It's an 86-rated special item that might be useful for SBCs)"

As End of an Era draws to a close, Carniball returns to Season 2 of FIFA Mobile featuring Masked and regular Carniballers, some of whom will be familiar to Season 1 veterans. Headlined by Juventus’ 92 CAM Paulo Dybala, Chelsea’s 91 LM Pedro Rodríguez, and RB Leipzig’s 90 ST Jean-Kévin Augustin as the three 90+ Master Carniballers, this 7 day/12 hour cyclical promotion circulates around 20 players from Carnival regions featuring more Training XP, coins, Skill Boosts, and the players themselves. 
In a Campaign-style promotion Season 2 Carniball showcases four themed Paths based on Brazilian, German, Spanish, and Rest of the World Carnivals. Completing all four paths will unlock Masked Prime Icon Carles Puyol's node, but like Prime Ronaldinho, Prime Lothar Matthaüs and Prime Marco van Basten, his node has lofty requirements of its own.
Carniball Main Event Chapter
Carniball uses Masks and Confetti as currency, and you can earn Masks through the Main Event Chapter. For those who lost the timezone lottery for End of an Era, Carniball is much gentler on your sleeping patterns. Refreshing every 12 hours are four unlockable repeatable events for 2 Stamina that guarantee an Unlocked Mask and 1,500 coins on the first win, and 1-5 Confetti with a chance at Broken Masks on repeat wins. Broken Masks have a trade-in in the Store for a random Mask (10 Broken Masks) or a specific Mask (15 Broken Masks).
Starting with only Brazil Masks and the Brazil event unlocked, the remaining 3 Masks and their related events will unlock as you progress through the Parade Chapter. Thus, to earn all 4 guaranteed Masks every 12 hours you will need to unlock all 4 paths as soon as possible.
The Players and the Carniball Parade Chapter
Besides Dybala and Pedro, Hoffenheim’s 88 RF Mark Uth and Newcastle’s 84 CF Ayoze Pérez also return as Carniballers, Uth as Masked player, and Pérez as a regular Carniballer. 
All 12 Carniballers are auctionable straight away, while the 8 Masked players -- two for each region -- are not tradable until after the Carniball event ends. Two players apiece for central positions - ST, CF, CM, CDM, CB, and GK -- supplement the lone wide men -- RF, RW, RM, RB, LM, LB, and Dybala’s CAM. Pedro’s LM will be a much valued player amongst the trending 3-at-the-back formations, a useful alternative to POTM Depay and a long awaited upgrade on Now and Later Hazard.
AS Roma’s 85 RW Gerson and AS Monaco’s 86 LB Jorge represent Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro region, home of arguably the most famous Carnival. They feature along the top Brazil line in the Parade Chapter with 22 million coins obtainable and chances at any of the 3 Brazil Nominee players, requiring Brazil Masks to complete nodes.
Gerson’s node on the Brazil Path is where the German Path splits off. Mark Uth and Hamburger SV’s 86 CDM Gideon Jung represent the German Carnival contingent, and can be found along the German Path with 4.1 million Training XP available. Nodes use German Masks as currency, and have chances at any of the 3 Nominee German players.
Jung’s node on the German Path leads the way to the Spanish Path where Tenerife-born Pedro and Madrid local 88 ST Fernando Torres embody the many Spanish Carnival celebrations held around the country, with 3,500 Skill Boosts and chances at the 3 Spaniard Nominees up for grabs here.
Below Torres’ node in the Spanish Path is the Rest of the World Path where Augustin and Dybala’s mask celebrations await those looking for XP, coins, and Skill Boosts. 5.6 million coins, 1.125 million Training XP and 1,125 Skill Boosts are node rewards along with the chances at the 3 World Nominee players.
Finally, completing all four Paths unlocks Prime Puyol's node. In addition to grinding your way through the various Paths you will need a 110+ OVR team with 8 Carniballers to earn Puyol.
In a similar vein to Bonus Points in TOTY, Confetti can be earned by playing events in the Main and Parade Chapters, and is used in the Store to buy rotating bonus offers. Of course, FIFA Point packs are available to speed your progress along, with generic Carniball Packs along with region specific Mask Packs and Bundles available in the Store.
Scattered throughout the Parade Chapter are Reward nodes offering a regular and a dynamic Carniball logo, and a Carniball trophy that requires a full team of Carniballers.
Guide to Completing Carniball
Unlocking the German Mask and Event requires 8 Brazil Masks, the Spanish Mask requires 20 German Masks, and the World Mask requires 35 Spanish Masks. If you only play the guaranteed event once every 12 hours, you can only get 14 Masks in total (4 days of only Brazil Events, followed by 3 days of Brazil/Germany Events). 
Carniball is an event designed to reward grinders with only 56 guaranteed Masks available over the whole event. Completing the Brazil Path requires 228 Brazil Masks, the German Path needs 8 Brazil Masks to unlock, followed by 220 German Masks to complete. 8 Brazil Masks, 20 German Masks, and 200 Spanish Masks to complete the Spain Path, and 8 Brazil, 20 German, 35 Spanish, and 165 World Masks to finish the World Path. With 228 Masks required to complete any one Path, a lot of grinding and/or packs to obtain the maximum rewards will be needed. 
If you have some saved up FP, or are looking at spending, my advice is to spend early to unlock as many guaranteed Masks you can. It will also provide you with more of a variety of events to grind. With no Weekend Tournament to offer extra Masks, you'll have to rely on grinding the Live Event, but be prepared to spend a lot of Stamina, as each event only has a Chance at Broken Masks with 10 Broken Masks equalling one random Mask, and 15 Broken Masks allows you to choose a Mask of your choice. 
If you can, hold off on the specific Mask trade-ins, as the Live Event guaranteed Masks are random, and you could end up with too many of one kind and not enough of another.
You earn 1-5 Confetti on each repeated Live Event win, and 5 Confetti per Mask used in the Parade Chapter.
Every 12 hours one specific Mask will be available in the Store for 75 Confetti and can be claimed three times, so don't worry if you don't get many Broken Masks as Confetti will give you Masks too, albeit more slowly.
Assuming a 2 Confetti/event average makes 37 Events per Mask, plus how ever many Broken Masks you get, so watch all your ads for Stamina, and conserve your Stamina in Campaigns. For your daily achievements, Eastern Europe 1.2 costs 2 Stamina and requires you to score only one goal in a 1v1 scenario. If the Mask on offer doesn't take your fancy, 200/250/300/400 Confetti will get you a player from that one of the four regions, and 50 Confetti can be traded in for one of coins/Training XP/Skill Boosts.
You should be aiming to complete a little bit of each Path, 63 Masks will reward you with coins, XP, Skill Boosts, 85 Gerson, 86 Jung, and 88 Torres. This opens up all 4 Live Events, giving more Masks as you progress. After this, choose whichever resource you require the most out of coins (Brazil), XP (Germany), Skill Boosts (Spain) or a bit of everything (World) and focus on making your way through that Path.
Summary
The art team at EA have outdone themselves again with some fantastic card art - check them out over on the comparison page. 
No new Skill Boosts, the highest rated LM so far, 12-hour event timers, and no more VSA make Carniball a relaxing change from End of an Era. A ton of resources -- 27.6 million coins, 5.225 million Training XP, and 4,625 Skill Boosts -- and Prime Icon Puyol allow for improvements and investments whether you’re looking for a new player to use or want to train your current squad. 
However, Carniball is an event that only gives out what you put in and requires heavy grinding for the better rewards. If you're looking for lots of resources for minimal effort, Carniball might not be for you -- there's a February Calendar ongoing that will give you freebies for logging in instead."

In addition to their announcement of the inclusion of Germany's 3. Liga in FIFA 18, EA Sports has announced that Czech First League side AC Sparta Prague will be included in FIFA 18.
Tomas Krivda, marketing director of AC Sparta Prague, stated that both the club and EA Sports FIFA have been discussing the clubs return to the FIFA franchise for quite some time. He added, ""We are very pleased that our club is returning to the legendary video game franchise.""
Sparta Prague is a historic Czech Republic side who has dominated the country's first division ever since its launch 123 years ago. ""The Maroons"" have won 33 Czech First League titles, 14 Czech Cups and 2 Czech Supercups. Their famed domestic past has seen the club grace Champions League (and its predecessors) more times than not. However, they have never lifted Europe's top prize, reaching as far the semifinals (1991-92) where they lost to Rangers. 
The last time the Czech club was featured in a FIFA game was FIFA 2011. Since then, only a few of their current players recently received FUT cards, including Semih Kaya, former Arsenal player Tomas Rosicky, Martin Dubravka, and Austrian national striker Marc Janko. 
Here's the announcement, via EA Czech Republic:

As fans patiently wait for the release of FIFA 18, they can now pass the time by arguing and debating over new players stats and ratings.

Leading the discussion is none other than former EA Sports FIFA community manager and current Twitch/YouTube rockstar Chu 'ChuBoi' Morah, who has been releasing weekly videos predicting the ratings of players from some of the world’s top clubs. In previous episodes Chu has offered his insight for Manchester United and Real Madrid with critical acclaim. This time, he tackles Barcelona FC. 
After a shaky (for their unbelievably high standards) 2016/17 season, the Catalan side ended their season deep in the shadow of their rivals Real Madrid and without a coach. Compared to previous Barca sides, last season's squad was underwhelming and trophieless. Now that Barcelona are beginning a new era under manager Ernesto Valverde, perhaps the LaLiga team can return to their glory days. But how will they fare in FIFA 18?
Amongst ChuBoi's candidates for upgrades, Gerard Piqué, Samuel Umtiti and Gerard Deulofeu stand out. All three players had productive seasons but were they decent enough to earn a rating increase? Personally, I believe Chu's decision to increase Messi's rating is a touch unwarranted, but what do you think?
As per usual, if you want to express your opinions on player ratings, make sure to check out Futhead’s FIFA 18 player ratings prediction pages. You can make your voice heard by voting and commenting feverishly until your opinion is heard.

Market Overview
EA delivered on the hype around the Winter Ones to Watch and Ones to Watch Squad Builder Challenges. It was a great week for these dynamic items, and hopefully you got your fill considering it was quite easy to spam the Untradeable versions of those. This OTW promotion also consisted of some supplemental SBCs and pack promos that caused the overall FUT market to dip; however, its been pretty stable and slowly creeping up around Weekend League. 
Looking specifically at the OTW market, it was a tale of two trends as the low rated items used for SBC fodder soared, settling around 40k, while elite prices took a hit as their supply increased. We’ll be adding Winter OTW items to the analysis next week, but overall there was plenty to cover in this jammed packed week! 

Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats


The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data that I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:   Remember, low rated (82 and below) items have been at their highs, while the upper tier players are hovering around their lows. Stay away from the likes of Theo Hernandez and Franck Kessie, but players like Kyle Walker and Corentin Tolisso might be good shouts. 
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take:  Huge week for volatility, but looking forward to a price correction I would be looking at high volatility figures like the PL trio of Romelu Lukaku, Alexandre Lacazette and Ederson as prime bounce back candidates. 

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Beta can help inform investors of the risk of future price swings, so I would be looking to Douglas Costa as someone with favorable price swing potential. On the other hand, the high figures on Bertrand Traore and Bruma demonstrate they could be in for some serious drops. 
TOTW Shout
Overall, it was a great week of real life football for OTW items. Three items were included in the TOTW, with Mohamed Salah, Michy Batshuayi and Theo Walcott all securing upgrades. Also, it should be noted Gerard Deulofeu put in a convincing performance, and after a week like that it bodes well for the future of the OTW market!

In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner - Mohamed Salah (Liverpool)   
The Weekly Rundown stats are taken form a Wednesday to Tuesday basis, so the huge price jump for Mohamed Salah is not completely apparent, but we felt it needed to be covered. After a huge, rather random, upgrade Salah went from an 86 straight to an 89. This upgrade delivers us an ealy Team of the Season-esque item, and lands Salah as our biggest winner. 
After a brace and overall sound performance against Spurs, the Egyptian was on the fringes of the Team of the Week considering the tie was a draw. Because of this, his volatility and beta remain medium, but it helped him avoid a price decline like the other elite OTW players. 
Looking to the future, such a major upgrade means his OTW item should not receive a Rating Refresh boost. That is only a small consideration, but definitely worth noting. Regardless, the pacey winger should hold his value going forward, and who knows what the European competition could have in store for us?

Big Loser - Alvaro Morata (Chelsea) 
Honestly, a lot more choices for biggest loser than expected this week. We always figured high rated OTWs were going to dip; however, there was a serious decline in prices of these items. After some careful consideration, we decided to drop Morata in the hot seat this week.
The Chelsea striker is in a little bit of a rut at the moment, and a deadline day move for Olivier Giroud places some more pressure on the Spaniard. Over the week, he sported a high volatility figure (~14,500), but pretty normal beta. As usual, that does not give us confidence in him in the future (bar him scoring a goal). If the ex-Juventus star can’t find the net, or string together some solid performances, expect that card to keep declining. 
Referring to the previous point, Morata is not alone as players like Alexandre Lacazette and Kyle Walker are in similar situations. But it must be said there is always a silver lining, Morata and other elite players are hovering around all-time lows. So, if you can slot a coupe into your side they could pay off nicely.
Recap & outlook
We got our Winter OTW and OTW SBCs, and man they were glorious. With the hype came the expected inflated prices, and we just hope you already sold your investments. Watch as the 82 and below rated players plummet, while the elites could see a minor positive price correction. It’s important to note that after this week's real life performances it seems some OTW items are primed for big upgrades, so let's hope that continues! Lastly, a couple final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: When the OTW promotion ends panic selling will dominate. So, look to some open bids, or get some sniper filters ready on your favorite items!    

-- OTW investors: Prices are still high for most items, but of course there are a couple that might be undervalued. Wait to pick up 82 and below investments, but now might be the time to snag some of those bigger name players. 
Let us know how you felt about the Ones to Watch promo below?  Also, if you got some free time, take your eyes on over to our Path to Glory Update!

Last week's score: 11/18
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad Link: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7353212/



Goalkeeper
Alexandr Belenov - GK - 75 OVR
With the return of the RPL alongside the absence of the MLS, I expect a lot of the Team of the Week to be from Russia this week. With that in mind we kick off the proceedings with Alexandr Belenov, who made a total of three saves to pick up Man of the Match in Ufa's 1-0 away win.
Defenders
Nils-Eric Johansson - CB - 72 OVR
It was AIK's turn to defeat Norrkoping this week with a narrow 1-0 home victory. The match was decided via an own goal, but it was Nils-Eric Johansson who stood out in the match for his defensive display on the field.
Viktor Vasin - CB - 73 OVR
Although Viktor Vasin already has a 74 TOTS item, what has happened in previous years is a 74 silver IF has also been awarded seeing as it has significantly lower stats than that of the TOTS. I think this could be the case here after Vasin picked up MOTM for his goal in CSKA's 3-1 away win. Alternatively the same could happen with Alexandr Golovin.
Kristoffer Haugen - CB - 67 OVR
The first of two Viking players set to make the cut this week is Haugen, who although wasn't MOTM picked up a 7 match rating to go alongside both an assist and clean sheet. He could miss out due to a teammate, though deserves a spot given the circumstances.
Midfielders
Oleg Shatov - RM - 81 OVR
If you have not used Oleg Shatov so far this FIFA I strongly suggest picking up what is likely to be a discard IF; you will not be disappointed. He makes his way into our side after grabbing both assists for Zenit in their 2-0 win.
Mike Jensen- CM - 74 OVR
I'm not entirely sure what EA will do with this item, should it happen, due to the previous special items he has picked up. Despite that, though he has a valid shout of getting in after picking up MOTM for his overall performance and assist during Rosenborg's 3-0 home win.
Alexandru Gatcan - CDM - 75 OVR
On paper, this match was a dead 1-1 draw. And honestly, that’s what it was. But with a gold midfielder finding himself on the scoresheet, it could well produce an in-form -- and that’s exactly what I am predicting with Alexandru Gatcan.
Kim in Seong - RM - 68 OVR
With minimal options being an understatement, the likelihood is that we will see several random players included with one goal often being more than enough to make it. Kim in Seong falls into that category; he also received a good match rating to boot. After picking up the only goal in Ulsan's 1-0 win alongside a 7.5 rating, I can see that being enough.
Forwards
Johnathan - ST - 67 OVR
Suwon pulled off the most convincing win from the K-League, recording a 3-0 win over Incheon. Johnathan was involved in all three of those goals, scoring twice himself before assisting the final goal. The Brazilian striker has been on the fringe of multiple sides recently but should finally get the nod now. If that wasn’t enough, he also scored another two in the second fixture he played this week.
Jo Inge Berget - ST - 71 OVR
Despite Malmo failing to win the match, I still expect Jo Inge Berget to be picking up an IF this week. He played in a ST role over a usual LM and performed well scoring two of their three goals picking up MOTM in the process.
Ricardo Laborde - ST - 74 OVR
Ricardo Laborde was given the role of lone striker rather than his usual wide role and proved why that was the case, scoring both Krasnodar goals in a narrow 2-1 away win over Rubin Kazan.
Substitutes
Sebastian Viera - GK - 72 OVR
When it comes to Sebastian Viera, I presumed he would eventually make it for scoring a couple of penalties seeing as he takes them for his club. However, he actually makes the cut for a performance in net. The Uruguayan saved a penalty alongside making seven other saves in Atletico's 1-0 away win.
Bubacarr Sanneh - CB - 66 OVR
I really struggled to select the final defender for this side and thus I went for one with a goal to his name. Although Horsens did concede, the fact they won should work strongly in Bubacarr Sanneh's favourite with his goal being pivotal in the 2-1 win.
Gabriel Somi - LM - 62 OVR
There are a couple of familiar Swedish names in this side, the first of which is Gabriel Somi, who picked up an IF in TOTW 42. This would result in the SIF being silver and with two assists to his name, it could well happen.
Besar Halimi - CM - 68 OVR
With Brondby managing a 4-0 home win at home to Midtjylland, I fully expect them to be picking up an IF come Wednesday. As to who that will be, that becomes a difficult question with no stand out options. I have decided to take a punt and go with Besar Halimi, who scored one of the four goals and was the furthest player back who managed that.
Nahir Besara - ST - 65 OVR
Although Besara picked up his first IF just two weeks ago, with the lack of games to select from for this side, I can see him picking up his SIF. After all, he did manage a hat trick for Orebro to continue his impressive form for the Swedish outfit.
Samuel Adegbenro - ST - 70 OVR
With a positional change to ST, Samuel Adegbenro becomes a decent silver item with pace, skills and a respectable shooting stat. He makes it into this side after scoring both Viking goals in a 2-0 away win over Odd.
Cesar Arias - ST - 67 OVR
Over to Colombia for the final selection this week, Cesar Arias managed to bag himself a brace in his sides 2-0 win. There were several Colombian players which didn't make the cut simply for the fact they were not in FUT. This can only help Arias's chances."

The latest very late Friday (or early Saturday for many players of the title) release of European Man of the Match items is a good one.
Along with the first seven days of the ten day FUT Birthday promo, players will have the chance to pack eight new orange-and-blue colored special player items, including a 96 ST Lionel Messi, fresh on the heels of advancing to the quarterfinals of yet another UEFA Champions League, as well as Tottenham dream crusher, Gonzalo Higuain of Juventus. For his part in The Old Lady's victory, Higuain's Path to Glory dynamic player item also gets a tidy upgrade.
The rest of the batch include Manchester United slayer Wissam Ben Yedder, plus an assortment of other UCL and Europa League heroes. No Arsenal nod alas for those holding out hope for a eMOTM there.

After a couple weeks of stable picks, EA went back to the basics and threw us some more curveballs. Since there was no FUT Swap player as the reward, they seemed to take liberty with including a couple very off the wall matches. That being said, the current Marquee Matchups SBCs is a great value to stack pack before the start of the Team of the Season promotion. 
European Options
Even though the European fixtures missed out this week, you shouldn’t disregard them just yet. WIth next week being the ties that decide the UCL and Europa league matchups, EA could just be sitting on them for this upcoming cycle. Within this cycle there are actually quite a few overlaps between teams featuring in these Euro matches as well as other rivalries, so it might help to pick up a few to hedge your bets. 
Real Madrid vs Bayern Munich
Liverpool vs Roma
Arsenal vs Atletico Madrid
Marseille vs RB Salzburg
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to be selected:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Real Madrid vs Barcelona
Match Info: When the Marquee Matchup cycle includes the likes of El Clasico, you know it's going to be a good week. This historic rivalry will still captivate the attention of a huge audience, and EA should be among them. So, with Real also having a Euro match shout this could be a very profitable investment choice. Worst case a derby like Celta Vigo vs Deportivo steals its thunder.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 79 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Marseille vs Nice 
Match Info:  The French league hasn’t received much love lately, but that should change soon. These two teams from the south of France have a derby, on their hands and that should be enough for EA to include them in the upcoming SBC. Look to the non-rares here as Ligue 1 usually produces nice returns.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Sporting vs Benfica
Match Info: Although Sporting featured a couple weeks ago, it would be tough to ignore this derby. The two portuguese sides are fighting for the top spots in the league, and would be just the right amount of weird to attract EA’s attention. Plenty of good non-rares options on both sides. 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


New York City FC vs New York Red Bulls
Match Info:  We head to the Big Apple where a crosstown classic kicks off between these two MLS sides. The season is still in its early stages for the USA top flight, yet this derby rounds out a packed week of rivalries for EA to choose from. Make sure to look to the highest rated non-rares you can find on either teams (silvers viable, too). 

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
There’s never four clear locks for Marquee Matchups, and we would not be doing our due diligence as investors if we didn’t consider additional fixtures. With already plenty of writing above, we’re going to keep this section short this week, and just hit you with the essentials: 
Chelsea vs Liverpool
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Villareal vs Valencia 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 77 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Kawasaki vs FC Tokyo
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Ulsan vs Pohang
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
If EA keep throwing us some major curveballs we have to be prepared. So, this week we are selecting two matches that might just be fringe enough for to warrant a selection 

Malmo vs Göteborg and Club Brugge vs Anderlecht
Recap
If you're new to Marquee Matchup investing take a look back at these beginner tips from my colleagues with the FUT Economist team. 
With plenty of big games to choose from we would love to hear your picks below! Also, feel free to share your thoughts on any games we missed."

FIFA 18's 27th Ultimate Team Team of the Week is ... top heavy, if nothing else.
While we'll be left to wonder if it was a lack-luster week that was in real world football or if a slightly neutered squad could imply a big-blow out ending to FUT Birthday forthcoming this weekend, let's focus on what we do know and that's that a few Path to Glory and Ones to Watch items lead the way this week.
Mohamed Salah heads to 91 overall as his rocket-like trajectory keeps on going upwards. Could a second consecutive Premier League Player of the Month (and third overall) be next? Mauro Icardi is now all the way up to 89 overall as he has his best FUT 18 item to date. Though a near virtual lock 'Calcio A' TOTS item won't impact the PTG, a run with Argentina (assuming the politics of yesteryear don't hurt his chances of making the team) this Summer could mean an even higher and better rated dynamic player item yet -- remember, a late rule change means PTG (though not OTW) will continue to have their ratings enhanced with the release of new International Man of the Match (or equivalent) items.
Finally, future Liverpool addition Naby Keita hasn't exactly been racking up the IFs this FIFA. With only a FUTmas item to his name prior, he finally becomes a more readily obtainable special item option for Bundesliga squad/hybrid builders.

It's officially official.
After all kinds of leaks, innuendo and rumors for the past four months, one of the most anticipated parts of FIFA 18 has been a confirmed: a free-to-owners-of-the-game update that brings the biggest tournament in world football to all aspects of the FIFA title is coming 29 May.  The update contains new game modes as well as a refreshed versions of the existing aspects of FIFA 18.
Amongst the game modes incorporated:
-- 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia: You can choose any of the 32 qualified nations and play through from the group stage all the way through the final.
--Custom FIFA World Cup Tournament: As EA put it themsevles, ""rewrite history"" and play as any licensed national team in FIFA, including the US, Italy, or the Netherlands as you create your own World Cup draw with the national teams that just missed off.
--FIFA World Cup Kick-Off: Pretty straight forward. The same game mode you played in your college dorm with roommates and friends, but now with World Cup action.
And of course the big one:
-- FIFA World Cup Ultimate Team: What little we know makes it sound similar to the FIFA 14 World Cup DLC, but with the addition of World Cup icons. Build an international squad from the players making up the 32 qualified nations with federation (UEFA, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, etc) substituting for club in FUT chemistry. And did we mention World Cup Icons?
Included in the other FUT World Cup aspects to be excited for:
--Dynamic Items: Based on in-game performances, the World Cup mode sounds like it's getting Ones to Watch/Path to Glory-type items that upgrade as those players standout in real life matches.
--Double packs incentive: For every Standard or Premium pack you buy in FUT World Cup, you'll get an equivalent value in the base game mode.
FUT Game Modes: The following will be available in FUT from which to play and build your FUT World Cup squad:
--Single Player & Online Tournament
--Single Player & Online Draft
--Squad Building Challenges

We'll also see the 12 official FIFA World Cup Russia stadiums in-game added as well.
If you were wondering about how player acquisition will work, FIFA's Community Global Lead Corey Andress confirmed that it'll operate similarly in practice to FIFA 14's World Cup game mode, but with the addition of Objectives and Squad Building Challenges:
My Twitter is going haywire, but no I didn’t delete - to clarify: there will be no Transfer Market in the World Cup mode. Players can get WC players through packs, either by buying them with points/coins or by earning them through SBCs and the various FUT game modes.— Corey Andress (@EACoreySA) April 30, 2018

After some early initial confusion about whether or not coins would be shareable across regular FUT and FUT World Cup, Andress later confirmed with the FIFA team that coins from your regular FUT team would in fact carry over to the World Cup game mode, just as they did in FIFA 14.
If that wasn't enough, check out this grainy, Instagram-y screengrab of the FUT World Cup item design, from the official trailer (we'll obviously share higher quality assets as we get them):

If you haven't already, make sure you catch that trailer here:

And we hadn't even mentioned: FIFA World Cup comes to FIFA Mobile as well, but a week later on 6 June. Double hype.

It's a bunch to digest, and surely there's more to come yet. What are you most hyped about the FIFA World Cup 18 update?"

In what is becoming a growing (and welcome) trend among the winners, the fourth and final installment of the July cTOTW plan has a distinctive personal twist, as ""Widdertiger"" mixed things up with a few English lower league, and specifically Sheffield Wednesday, players thrown into the mix. Similar to his leaguemate Daniel last week, ""Widdertiger"" topped the leaderboard from the get-go and no one could catch him throughout the week.
Many people may not be interested in the 96 version of Mendy’s card if they have the old Attack Mode Master Danny Rose, or Ultimate Team of the Season Filipe Luis, but his +1 Tackling boost, along with +1 Sprint Speed, will be welcome to those who missed out on both players - along with the potential for the vastly improved boosts if he is chosen as the Player of the Month. 
This week is the fourth and final installment of the July Player of the Month plan, so if you are attempting to craft the final 99 rated player, the end is near.
The Player of the Month plan will be revealed early next month, and you will need to have completed the cTOTW plan from all four of this month's winners - ‘baozhu’, ‘MooPiCait', ‘Daniel’ and obviously ""Widdertiger"" this week. 
Now comes the key question - who will get that all important Player of the Month nod? The four options are: Naby Keïta, Cristiano Ronaldo, Sadio Mané or the aforementioned Benjamin Mendy. 
This week's team features:
89 GK Jack Butland
82 LWB Daniel Pudil
82 CB Tom Lees 
92 CB Gérard Piqué
88 RWB Michail Antonio
81 CDM Sam Hutchison
90 CDM Renato Sanches
90 LW Memphis Depay
88 ST Theo Walcott
83 RW Pablo Hernández
96 LB Benjamin Mendy (Master Player)"

Market Overview
As promised, we’re coming at you with a bigger and better Path to Glory Analysis! EA graced us with a new batch of “Spring” PTG items which featured some top-class players, and this promotion kicked off a stream of steady content that has caused the FUT market to spiral into a huge crash. Almost all high end players saw their prices plummet, while consistent SBC content has kept the price of 82-84 rated items at a premium. So, it might be time to flex on some of those stretch cards you’ve been waiting for all FIFA. 
Narrowing in on the Path to Glory items, there is plenty to talk about, especially with the new items. Interestingly, a few “Spring” items have kept their value surprisingly well as their prices continue to settle, while the “Autumn” items followed the market down after being sky high during the original PTG promotion. The latter trend was expected; however, the former was rather new but it raises the question: what is their outlook? Well, keep reading as we try to untangle that very point.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats



The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  Looking at the Spring and Autumn rundowns the sectors are pretty similar. The high/low spreads of Autumn show some promise as most are at their lows; however, the previous highs were artificial due to the items being required in SBCs. So, tread lightly in this section, but we like the looks of Saul, Thomas Lemar and Dani Carvajal here.

Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take: With the size of the recent market crash, high volatility figures were expected. Prices have been all over these past few days, and in times of uncertainty the best items are in high potential individuals. Stick close to the likes of Jamie Vardy, Bernardo Silva and Stephan El Shaarawy.     

Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Just like volatility, beta figures were going to be a little inflated due to the overall market’s poor performance. Yet, some players poised to hold their value seem to be Raheem Sterling, Ilkay Gundogan and Marquinhos. 
TOTW & Upgrade Shout 
After a pretty quiet stretch, Mauro Icardi exploded back into relevance with a four goal haul over the weekend. New PTG item holders rejoice as he’s as close to a lock as you can get for an inform/upgrade. If you’re looking for profit you should always sell during the hype over the weekend, as his price will drop with his inform as next week goes on. 
A smaller shout is Ousmane Dembele who has been playing really well over the course of the past couple weeks, is he one to watch?
Big Winner - Mauro Icardi (Internazionale)
We said earlier we were surprised at how well a couple of the Spring PTGs held their value, so it seemed we were always plucking our winner from that list. Yet, the Inter man made our choice easy after raking up four goals, as Mauro Icardi cemented himself as our biggest winner. 
Nothing is definitive; however, you’d be hard press to find a more sure thing than Icardi getting an inform (and PTG upgrade) during TOTW27. So, like all previous dynamic item trends, we want to inform the readers that it's best to sell items into their hype, as price drop significantly as the week progresses. In Icardi’s particular case, his high volatility suggests he won’t break this trend. 

In terms of outlook, this item is going to be a lethal striker, but not necessarily FUT Champs meta. A little lack of pace will always hamper his price, but when Mauro gets scoring he usually does in it bunches making this an item to definiley monitor over the next month!
Big Loser -  “Autumn” PTG Items
Hopefully you heeded our warning about the price cliff these items were headed for last week, and if you did you can rest easy. That being said, it was pretty difficult to pick just one item to be the biggest loser, so we gave it to the whole Autumn sector. Yet, as always with huge price declines, panic sellers allow us an opportunity for cheap investments. 
So, what items are catching our eye going forward? Well, we have a few picks for varying budgets. If you are a high risk/high reward type of trader, with a lot of excess coin, Gabriel Jesus is in a unique position to shine. He has experienced a big dip in price recently, but a second upgrade would catapult him back to elite prices. For the middle range investor, Raphael Varane still looks like the most solid shout. We’ve mentioned him a couple times before, but lots of fixtures and a spot in a top side means he still has value. 
Finally, for all those lower budget FUT players, Danny Welbeck has been in fine form and comes in at a reasonable price. One can still make profit flipping him before PL and Europa league ties, or hold and hope for a goal. Remember, with Team of the Season approaching take profit where you can! 

Recap
The Path to Glory market had similar returns between the Autumn and Spring items; however, losses were compounded by the overall FUT market crash. It has been a jam packed March, and over the course of the next week we might see the market shift from buyer’s favor to seller’s, you just have to be patient. There are definitely some PTG items that are compelling investments going forward, just remember to be patient when buying and sell into the hype!             

We’d love to hear your guess of which PTG item will have the best World Cup? So share below, and as always, lookout for some more dynamic item analysis in our Ones to Watch market update later in the week.

Thanks to a combination of playoff matches, the imminent TOTS releases, and the usual dose of weird selections, we have a bumper edition of the Unpredictables for you this week with 10 players missed from TOTW 32. As the weeks roll by predictions only gets tougher, so let's check-out who we missed, and why? 
Sergej Milinkovic-Savic – CM – Lazio
It’s been quite the season for Lazio’s Serbian midfield powerhouse who this week picked up his fourth TOTW IF in FUT 18, establishing himself as one of this seasons top performers. Milinkovic-Savic was instrumental in Lazio’s 4-0 win against Sampdoria scoring one himself and assisting another for Ciro Immobile. His TOTS is going to be a monster so get saving. 
Aaron's View: With three IFs to his name already I felt that a goal and assist was too cheap for a fourth for Milinkovic-Savic, especially with TOTS just around the corner. 
Lukas Podolski – CAM – Vissel Kobe
Now plying his trade in the J-League with Vissel Kobe, Lukas Podolski made his first real impact of this campaign scoring twice in their 3-0 win against Nagoya. Vissell Kobe are currently 6th in the league after an above average start to the season but most importantly, that famous hammer of a left foot is back in FUT with 96 shot power.

Aaron's View: I was very close to including Podolski but with a hat-trick from Hugo Viera excluded, I couldn’t justify Podolski who I felt was the second best option from the J-League this week.
Aissa Mandi – CB – Real Betis
Real Betis are unbeaten in seven La Liga games now and have a firm grip on one of the two Europa League spots available. Their latest result of note came on Sunday against second place Atletico Madrid where they held out for a 0-0 draw. Centre back Aissa Mandi was his sides standout performer with 5 interceptions and one very crucial clearance off the line. 
Aaron's View: Mandi gets in for a good performance against Atletico which although it came against a top side is always difficult to predict. La Liga defenders have seen an increase in these kinds of selections in past weeks; definitely something to look out for.
Marcos Diaz – GK – Atletico Huracan
Huracan currently occupy 5th spot in the Argentine Primera Division and they’re in good form too with three wins in their last three matches. Their latest win came against 24th placed Tigre, where goalkeeper Marcos Diaz made five saves and kept a clean sheet. Given the opposition, not the easiest keeper for Aaron to pick out this week.
Aaron's View: By far the hardest to predict this week was Diaz. I still don’t really know why he was selected with 5 saves in a routine 2-0 win, so I guess I must be missing something?
Lomban – CB – SD Eibar
We now head over to a Wednesday night fixture in La Liga where Eibar beat Espanyol 1-0 away from home. Centre back Lomban was without doubt the player of the night scoring the winning goal as well as making nine clearances, three tackles and two interceptions. The problem however is that Eibar then lost 1-0 to Getafe on the weekend which more than likely affected the prediction. 
Aaron's View: Lomban is one I probably should have predicted but instead I tried to be clever with Radu from Lazio. That backfired with Milinkovic-Savic getting the nod instead.
Hans Vanaken – CAM – Club Bruges
It’s playoff time in the Belgian Jupiler League and Club Bruges are doing rather well. They hammered Charleroi 6-0 on Thursday night and then played out a 4-4 classic against Standard Liege on Sunday. Across those two games Hans Vanaken from CAM scored one and grabbed three assists for his IF this week.
Aaron's View: A goal and three assists for Vanaken makes him a fair selection by EA. The problem I had is that he featured in the Community TOTS shortlist and with Jahanbaksh already in my prediction, I didn’t want to select Vanaken only to find he was unable to be selected.
Adrien Regattin – LM – Osmanlispor FK
Osmanlispor FK may be in a relegation dog-fight in the Turkish Super Lig, but they have only lost one game in their last eight which has given them more than a fighting chance of staying up. Their lastest win came on the weekend against Genclerbirligi where they ran-out comfortable 3-0 winners. Adrien Regattin was the MOTM scoring two of those goals from left midfield. 
Aaron's View: A vital game in Osmanlispor’s relegation battle seems to be the prime reasoning for Regattin making the TOTW over other options. That said we were not short of midfielders to choose from this week.
Viktor Fischer – LM – FC Copenhagen
Another country in full playoff mode is Denmark where two wins in a week gave FC Copenhagen a welcome boost after to losing a tight match against Brondby last weekend. The first win of the week came in the form of a 2-1 win against AaBAalborg where Viktor Fischer scored the winner. And the second a 4-1 win against Horsens were Viktor Fischer scored one and assisted another. A decent contribution over the two games, just enough for his IF. 
Aaron's View: *Under the circumstances Fischer is another random addition. Copenhagen are really struggling this season in comparison to what you would expect but did record a 4-1 win over Horsens. Fischer grabbed a goal and an assist but in reality there were far better options, especially with another Danish addition in this TOTW. *
Saba Lobjanidze – LM – Randers FC
And now another Danish League IF but this time from relegation Group 2 where Randers faced off against SønderjyskE. And having lost 1-0 against SønderjyskE just two weeks ago, Randers put in a much better performance this time around winning 3-0. All three of those goals went to Saba Lobjanidze who picked up the hat-trick. 
Aaron's View: The first of two hat tricks I missed this week, both of which are for similar reasons. Lobjanidze was playing in a relegation play off match (usually these games don’t count towards the TOTW) and it’s been that way for several years now. I’m not sure what changed? 
Hamdi Harbaoui – ST – SV Zulte-Waregem
And finally, we head to Belgium where SV Zulte Waregem are in blistering form after scoring 12 goals in their last three matches. And the man at the centre of that strike power is Hamdi Harboui who scored 4 against Excel Mouscron, 3 against Lierse and last weekend a single strike against Kortrijk. 8 goals in three games for the Tunisian and a well deserved IF. 
Aaron's View: Harbaoui missed out with 4 goals last week and therefore I presumed the Europa league playoff games wouldn’t count towards the TOTW. Some inconsistent selecting is why I missed this one."

We didn't exactly set the world on fire with our predictions this past week, but we did seem to get most of the big Team of the Week shouts that counted, including the Ones to Watch and Path to Glory dynamic player items. 15/23 is solidly solid overall, though. The marquee miss this week is PSG's own Marco Verratti, who's played his way up to an 89-overall black-and-gold item. Let's take a look at why TOTW 26 got the in-forms that they did and why Aaron, in his own words, ommitted the ones he did in fact miss.
Marco Verratti – CM – PSG
PSG are now a whopping 23 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 and even without the injured Neymar their league dominance has continued unabated. The latest team to feel their wrath were Metz who were soundly beaten 5-0 at the Parc des Princes on Saturday. Lots of goals in this one but the IF instead goes to Marco Verratti who provided two assists and a 94% pass completion. His team mate Nkunku will probably feel a little hard done by, but you really can’t deny the quality of the Italian maestro. 
Aaron's View: *I opted for team mate Nkunku who was the official MOTM. However that was always a risk with him being a Silver. Verratti is another fair choice for his two assists. *
Milan Skriniar – CB – Inter Milan
Stopping Napoli from scoring takes some doing and Inter managed just that to earn themselves a valuable point in their battle to make the top four where they sit just a point behind Lazio. It was a great team performance, but the standout player on the day was undoubtedly Milan Skriniar who made 6 tackles and 8 clearances to ensure the shut-out. 
Aaron's View: Skiriniar was MOTM in a dull 0-0 draw against Napoli but with Vitor Hugo and Manolas scoring goals and keeping clean sheets in Italy; I felt both of those were better candidates.
Jonathan Tah – CB – Bayer Leverkusen
And now on to another solid defensive performance from Jonathan Tah who inspired Leverkusen to an impressive 2-0 win against Borussia Monchengladbach making 5 clearances and winning 100% of his aerial duels. However, Tah’s standout moment in the game came in the 87th minute where he made a fantastic last ditch tackle with the game at 1-0. Julian Brant then scored the second for Lekerkusen in extra time, but Tah’s tackle very much saved the day.

Aaron's View: One of the stranger choices this week. Alario was MOTM for Leverkusen, while Tah only picked up an average match ratin., I feel there were far better defensive options to select this week.
James Chester – CB – Aston Villa
Championship games are coming thick and fast now, but the standout result on the weekend was undoubtedly Aston Villa’s 4-1 win against table topping Wolves. The goals were spread around the team with Adomah, Bjarnason, Grabban and TOTW entrant James Chester all finding the back of the net. No clean sheet for Chester but this is now his 3rd goal in as many games. Bang in form. 
Aaron's View: Aston Villa played two games this week which can count towards the TOTW. Chester scored in both those games which has seemingly been taken into consideration. If we took each game separately, I don’t feel that Chester would have made it.
Bibras Natcho – CDM – CSKA Moscow
CSKA Moscow are 8 points behind leaders and rivals Lokomotiv but they’re making a decent effort of closing that gap with a comfortable 3- 0 win against FK Akhmat coming on Sunday. Whilst he didn’t get on the scoresheet the standout performer was undoubtedly Bibras Natcho who recorded 2 assists and 5 tackles in an all-action midfield display. 
Aaron's View: It was only a matter of time before EA forced a Rusian Premier League player into the side and Natcho looks to be that guy. He did pick up a couple of assists in CSKA’s 3-0 win as did many other players with some missing out scoring twice and getting an assist. Natcho played well but there were better options this week.
Aleksander Mitrovic – ST – Fulham
Another Unpreditable from the Championship this week comes in the form of Aleksander Mitrovic who has been a revelation since joining Fulham in January. The Serbian has 7 goals in 6 appearances with two of those coming against Sheffield United in midweek, and another two against Preston on Saturday. He may have struggled in the Premier League, but Fulham fans won’t care one bit as they mount a serious promotion push. 
Aaron's View: Similarly to Chester, Mitrovic played twice and in both games he scored twice. Again, if we took the games individually, I don’t believe he would have made it. But it’s something I'll look at going forwards.
Florian Klein – RB – Austria Wein
Austria Wein currently occupy 7th in the Austrian Bundesliga but they had no trouble dispatching bottom club St Polten 4-0 on Saturday. Florian Klein had a particularly good game in this one scoring twice from fullback, but some questions probably need to be asked about why a game between these sides has made the TOTW cut.
Aaron's View: There were many defenders with multiple goal contributions this week and therefore it became very difficult to choose between them. Klein wins the roll of the dice and gets in for his brace.
Tim Boss – GK - Fortuna Koln
And finally, we end our Unpredictable search in the third tier of German football where Fortuna Koln took on Lotte. And it was an important win for Fortuna who are just four points off the top in fifth place. Dominik Ernst and Daniel Keita-Ruel scored the goals but it was goalkeeper Tim Boss (great name) who picks up the IF for the clean sheet and 100% save percentage. Which you’d expect from a clean sheet… 
Aaron's View: Tim Boss was Player of the week in the third division of Germany, but with so many silver goalkeepers performing, I opted to stick with the hat tricks. If I were to pick a keeper, it would have been Felgueiras, who saved a penalty in a shock 1-0 over Porto anyways."

Some news made headway on social media Wednesday after the Belgian Gaming Commission singled out ""Overwatch"", ""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive"", and yes, ""FIFA 18"" for ""violating gambling legislation."" Minister of Justice Koen Geens proclaimed an investigation into so-called ""loot boxes"" associated with those titles was found to be essentially lacking the protective measures of traditional gambling, particularly with respect to minors.
Though a press release included a lot of strong verbiage aimed at publishers, including threats of a potential ""prison sentence of up to five years and a fine of up to 800,000 euros,"" the underlying purpose of the statement seemed to be aimed at more generating a dialogue with AAA publishers like Blizzard and EA. There's no hard and fast timetable or specific law (rather an interpretation of existing legislation) that would force any of the companies' hands, but it's clear the powers that be want to make their thoughts on the controversial subjects known in hope of enacting meaningful change in the games down the road.
While it's possible the big gaming publishers' armies of high-priced attorneys, legal experts, and lobbyists could flex their muscles and eventually come to an arrangement that would allow them to keep the status quo effectively as is, where things get interesting is that follows a declaration last week from The Netherlands' gaming authority, which had a bit more teeth to it.

The Dutch Gaming Authority very matter of factly demanded ""FIFA 18"", ""Dota 2"", ""Player Unknown's Battlegrounds"", and ""Rocket League"" remove the ""addiction-sensitive elements"" of their games (e.g. visual effects, ostensibly like pack-opening animations, as well as the ability to open one pack/loot box in quick succession after another) by 20 June, 2018, obtain a license, or risk fine and/or a potential ban. Such a quick turn around for the smaller, more nimble studios would be conceivable, but short of no longer selling FIFA there, it's harder to imagine a massive studio like EA being able to turn on a dime and radically change last year's title in one single market in just a few months' time as they continue development on other projects.
Though that threat is far more concrete, including a firm date, specifically outlined requests, and action required, the fact that two prominent European nations have now taken like action is probably the biggest takeaway from all the aforementioned headlines. Will other countries follow suit? And given the rise and proliferation of competitive gaming for many if not all of the titles above, how will studios like EA respond as it won't be as feasible to have multiple versions of the same games released in different markets considering?
Perhaps the biggest aspect working in EA's favor at the moment are governments like the UK's (so-far) disagreeing with the others' findings. Some U.S. local politicans of lesser national impact have used the subject as a means to draw attention to the controversies, but none from any actual legislative places of prominence have taken up the cause nor has there been much institutional momentum nationally to take any real action. US President Donald Trump met with gaming industry leaders in March following a shooting at a school in the state of Florida, ostensibly to discuss the impact of violent gameplay on society, but the subject of loot boxes or gambling never came up.
A change in December to the US-based Apple App Store's review guidelines required game makers to disclose ""odds"" in-game, but months later, that pivot has not been echoed by their biggest rivals at Google's Play store. Since FIFA Points aren't sold outright in the FUT Companion App (except on PC through EA's Origins service) as well, FIFA console hasn't been impacted. ""FIFA Mobile""'s second season has displayed ""rare"" and ""very rare"" next to in-form equivalent items before you open packs, but exact percentages haven't been surfaced anywhere in the game, even following the guidelines change. It's unclear if the fact the game in a very literal sense sells ""FIFA Points"" and not loot boxes directly allows them to escape the tweak to the iOS-specific terms and conditions.
With the Netherlands in particular home to multiple FIFA eSports teams and organizations and the government there being far more matter of fact than any others so far, it's clear some kind of next step will be required by EA. Whether that's an appeal, counter-legal action, or a dialogue directly with Dutch and/or Belgian regulators in an effort to keep things more as is remains to be seen. It'll be fascinating to see what, if anything, different we see if an expected World Cup-mode is released in the leadup to that big global football tournament or as ""FIFA 19"" gets closer and closer."

Last week couldn't have gone any worse really. With a few upsets having happened in the last few weeks, I tried to predict that again, but with no success as my two big punts went the way of the bookies' favourites. 
Onwards and upwards from here as we go into another tough week of fixtures.

Marseille v Lyon
We start off in France, where third host fourth. Both sides will be desperate for a win to help boost their chances of catching the team ahead of them and improve their prospects in next seasons European competitions. 
Marseille are currently four points behind second placed Monaco, who also have a far superior goal difference. With this being their last properly tough match of the season, while Monaco still have to travel to PSG, they will be hoping to keep the pressure up on the side above them in case of any slip up. Marseille’s potential downfall may be that they have a tough Europa League second leg tie on Thursday night against Athletic Bilbao. With a 3-1 lead, their opponents will be going all out to try and bring the tie back, meaning Marseille can't be complacent or rest too many players ahead of their tough weekend fixture. They will be high in confidence coming into the game, having dropped just 11 points at home all season. Since their loss at home in early September, they have managed eight wins and three draws and will be hoping to keep up their good run of form.
Lyon’s recent form has been poor, with just 13 points from their last 10 league games. That run has seen them fall from joint second with Monaco to nine points behind them, and they are now five points away from even getting into the Champions League qualifies next season. They have managed four wins in their last eight in all competitions, with only one loss in that run. They haven't been scoring many goals with ten goals in their last eight, but with only six conceded they will be hoping their tight defence is enough to help them through this tough game. 
It has been nearly four years since Marseille won against Lyon, with Lyon having triumphed three times in that time. The hosts are favourites once again and performances recently would suggest that they are more than capable of picking up a valuable three points. 
Game played: Sunday 18th, 8:00 p.m. (GMT) / 4:00 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Marseille win 

Fenerbahce v Galatasaray
Two Turkish giants face off in the Eternal derby -- the only game derby game to be played between teams in two continents. 
Fenerbahce currently sit fourth in the table, six points behind their rivals, and will be desperate to win to cut that difference, along with the pride that comes with any derby triumph. Their form recently isn't exactly confidence boosting, having picked up just nine points from their last five games in the league, while they also drew with Besiktas in the first leg of their Turkish Cup semifinal just two weeks ago. Their away for all season has been pretty dismal, but their home form is keeping them in contention for European qualification next season. Having lost just once and drawn twice at home since mid-September, they are almost unstoppable at home, and will be hoping to keep that run going against their bitter rivals. 
Galatasaray are in slightly better form, with just one loss in their last five league games and two in their last 16 in all competitions. In Bafetembi Gomis, they have a striker who has scored an insane 12 goals in his last 7 appearances and has helped Galatasaray move to the top of the table. With the best attack in the league, scoring 12 more goals than anyone else, along with the third best defence, a win this weekend will help them move one step closer to the league title. However, their disappointing away form all season has been the only thing holding them back from having won the league already, with just 16 points from a possible 36 picked up on their travels.
This game is very tough to call, with Fenerbahce having come out on top in two of the last three matches between these sides, and haven't lost at home to their rivals since 1999. The second of those wins at that end of last season was the first time in five years that an away side has won a tie between these sides. Whether Galatasaray are able to make that another away win this time round remains to be seen. I feel like a draw is very likely, but with current form favouring Galatasaray, and home from and past results favourite Fenerbahce, this really could go either way. 
Game played: Saturday 17th, 4:00 p.m. (GMT) / 12:00 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw

Shamrock Rovers v St Patrick's
The Irish league started back just over a month ago, so we are starting to get to the point of the season where it may be possible to accurately predict things. Fourth host fifth in the game we care about this week in what should be a closely fought game.
Shamrock Rovers are the most successful team in Irish football, with an impressive 19 league titles. However they haven't won the league in since 2011, and their start to this season makes it look like they'll struggle to take home the title in October at the end of the season. Two poor games to start that season were followed up with two wins where they scored six goals, before a disappointing 1-0 defeat to league leaders Cork. Their home form from last year has carried over, having not lost in normal time in 10 home games in all competitions. 
St Patrick's aren't doing much better than their opponents so far this season, having only scored five and conceded six in their five games so far this season. It is their away form which has helped them get to fifth in the table so far, having picked up six of their seven points this season while on the road. However, those two wins came against the two sides who are currently bottom of the table, so it's difficult to say how they will manage against a good team. 
What makes this game that bit more difficult to call is that Shamrock Rovers are unbeaten at home, with two wins and a draw, while St Patrick's two wins do far this season have both come away from home. I feel like Shamrock Rovers should have the advantage though, with their impressive home form helping carry them through against a tough opponent. 
Game played: Friday 16th, 8:00 p.m. (GMT) / 4:00 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Shamrock Rovers win 

Lincoln City v Grimsby Town
With the FA Cup playing, there are just four games being played in the Premier League, so we head to the lower leagues of England to find our last game. The two Lincolnshire sides are both hoping to get a win as they battle it out at opposite ends of the table.
Lincoln are battling it out for a spot in the Playoffs at the end of the season, currently sitting in 8th place in the league - one point off the Playoffs and only eight behind automatic promotion. Recent back-to-back losses to Crawley and Crewe may have dented their hopes of promotion, but they will be hoping to get two wins in a row for the first time since January. 
Grimsby are battling their way to avoid a potential relegation battle, currently sitting seven points ahead of the bottom two sides. However, they have managed to pick up just one point in their last five games, and haven't won in their last 16 games. They have scored the least goals in the league all year, averaging a goal every 107 minutes in the league and are yet to keep a clean sheet in 2018.
The reverse fixture back in September ended 0-0, but I feel like Grimsby will have a tough time being able to replicate that result and, although Lincoln’s form isn't the greatest, the hosts should still be able to win this one.
Game played: Saturday 17th, 1:00 p.m. (GMT) / 9:00 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Lincoln win

As was revealed on Futhead yesterday, 85 Overall Steve Mandanda is this weeks reward, meaning we can now build a full Matchups squad if you wanted to. If the Marseille keeper doesn't take your fancy, you can pick up some Training XP instead, to help boost your team to the next level. 
Good luck and happy predicting!"

Market Overview
It has been a rollercoaster of emotions (and hype) for the FUT market this week. The Path to Glory promotion kicked off a steady stream of FUT content that continued with a barrage of special packs and now reaching a fever pitch with EA dropping FUT Birthday. All of the preceding promos caused some serious market shocks, which have driven down player prices leading to what many consider a crash.
Turning to the Ones to Watch sector, the effects of the overall FUT market dip become evident as majority of items took a hit this week. The general decline in the items is due largely to PTG items stealing the show, but should we be looking to this as a opportunity? Well, as usual there are pros and cons, but keep reading to stay informed on how you can navigate a treacherous time in the FUT market.

Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats



The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data that I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:   This week’s high/low spread should be taken with a grain of salt considering most items will be closer to their “low” values. It does mean there is some hope for high hype potential individuals to bounce back in the likes of Theo Walcott, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Kyle Walker.

Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take:  Some large figures here, this section was also impacted hard by the FUT market decline. Ederson, Corentin Tolisso and Philippe Coutinho are all players that have sported some high Volatility figures that could see them flip to the positive side if the market recovers soon.
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take:  Now beta this week is a tricky subject. There were a lot of outside market factors that contributed to the drop, so you might want to play it safe and look for lower value items with high betas. For example, Davinson Sanchez, Douglas Costa and Aymeric Laporte could be lower risk assets going forward. 

TOTW Shout
Amidst the weekly content hype and red returns, two players managed to put together quality real life performances. Serge Aurier and Michy Batshuayi both put in quality shifts for their sides, and in the process were awarded with informs. 
Both have quality cards, but don’t think they’re immune to the major price drops going on. 
In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner - Serge Aurier (Tottenham)
In a week where only a handful of players avoided negative profit, one man stood out. Serge Aurier put in a goal and an assist in a 4-1 victory, but the community seemed torn about his TOTW inclusion. Yet, with a new upgrade this beast of a player item becomes our biggest winner. 
We’ve seen quite a lot of TOTW players grace the biggest winner tab, so we can jump past some of the statistics to talk about his outlook. The Ivorian right-back becomes an elite option in PL which lacks depth in his position. So, with limited substitutes, if Aurier picks up another inform his price will skyrocket! That being said it's a big if with domestic leagues coming to an end. 
We’d recommend cashing in if you can, and if you’re looking to invest wait until this market crash hits its low.

Big Loser - Alvaro Morata (Chelsea)
Contrary to the previous section, there were a number of options to choose from as the OTW sector had a rough week. So, we opted to select a player who we wanted to examine their outlook in more detail, thereby making Alvaro Morata our biggest loser. 
The Chelsea attacker has experienced a tough run of form lately, and recently being overlooked for Giroud in their UCL tie just compounds his misery. It also might not be a stretch to say his price would have dropped anyways, but is there a bright side to this situation?
Well, looking at Morata’s OTW item you are getting an 87 overall for around 85k. This isn’t a completely bad deal; however, his pace doesn’t make him too desirable. He has hype potential due to his league and nation, but he needs to show us something on the pitch before we touch this item.

Recap & outlook
A steady stream of pretty quality content from EA has caused the FUT market to crash as SBCs have taken coins off the market, while pack promos have increased supply. This combination led to a perfect storm of price dropping mayhem for higher rated items, while 82-84s still hold their premium prices. Ones to Watch items followed the market down, but a couple items showed there is still value in this sector. Make sure to take profit when you can though, as the end of domestic seasons is just over the horizon. Finally, here’s some quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Panic selling is real at the moment. If you feel comfortable with a player’s price now could be a nice time to snipe, or pickup on open bid.     

-- OTW investors: Starting to get quite risky investing in these items going forward. Prices did just drop tremendously so there could be value in high hype potential players (La Liga, BPL, etc…).

Friday, the FIFA 18 Ultimate Team live production team unveiled the latest and greatest promo, just in time for Halloween and Dia de los Muertos.
FIFA ""Ultimate Scream"" is back for another FUT, with the premise being roughly the same: players involved get nominally boosted ""in-form"" type special items, that for a limited time (confirmed for October 29-November 1), get super boosts that make them almost on the same level as a Team of the Season type item.
What differs this FIFA, would appear to be that the items will get those mega boosts during other ""spooky"" times of the year as well. Friday The 13ths would be in play, for example.
None of the cards instanteously jump out at us as must have without the mega-boosts -- perhaps Mesut Ozil for Arsenal fanboys and girls or Karim Benzema, Mateo Kovacic, Yannick Carrasco, or Gerard Deulofeu for those with La Liga squads?
You can view the full Ultimate Scream team here:"

The first Team of the Week we'll see during this FIFA's inaugural Team of the Season is here.
A couple of the widely expected names make the cut. Amongst them, the man behind Napoli's Serie A title race changing header, Kalidou Koulibaly. It's not the ratings of his FUT Birthday item, but Marco Reus gets a FUT 18 in-form as well -- and it's at CAM, no less. Finally, if you played the long game, Ones to Watch Alexandre Lacazette gets his first boost of the game. Better late than never, I guess.
We're not exactly big-time traders or market experts or anything, but a word to the wise: if you don't absolutely need one of these player items to complete your squad, just wait. Once the TOTS packs start opening en masse, the prices on all of these (even the static in-form answers to the OTW and Path to Glorys) will all decrease.
Here's the full FUT 18 TOTW 32:"

Those who logged into FIFA Mobile late Tuesday/early Wednesday were greeted with an update from the usual 5 p.m. Pacific Time deploy they might not have been expecting.
Beginning Tuesday, October 24 at 22:00 UTC (that's 11:00 p.m. Tuesday evening in the UK or 6 p.m. in the Eastern Time Zone in the US), FIFA Mobile's transfer market is being disabled. You'll no longer be able to bid or buy items you hadn't previously already won. 
According to the FIFA Mobile production team, this move is to lay the ground work for FIFA Mobile's second act, Season 2. Though the majority of plans in-game are set to end November 1, we've still yet to have a concrete launch date announced for S2. But given as this is taking place a week prior, November 1 is looking more and more likely.
So what does this mean for you in the short term? If you had designs on making some end-of-season moves to upgrade your squad, either by trading in purchases for XP to redeem Pre-Season program players or just inserting them directly on into your team, you'll want to start doing so sooner rather than later. The same can be said for the pieces required to be redeemed for a Treasure Chest. Considering how hectic the market will be its final 24 hours, if you wait until October 23, it'll probably already be too late."

            Updated on
            



Last week saw all four of the bookies' favourites fail to win as we managed to get 1/4 correct.
As most of the big leagues across Europe start to wind down for the summer, we still have a few big games left to play, including some this week.
So, let's get into this week's games.

Manchester United v Arsenal
Manchester United have definitely been my bogey team for trying to predict, having caused a couple of upsets that I was unable to predict. This time round they have home advantage against an Arsenal side who have recently found form again as they push for fifth place.
United have been in fine form, with big wins over Spurs and Manchester City in the past few weeks. However, they did suffer a shock loss to West Brom which handed rivals Manchester City the title. With only second place left to play for, they will be going all out to keep ahead of closest rivals Liverpool and Spurs, who sit three and six points behind respectively. Having just come out on top against a very strong Spurs side in their FA Cup semifinal, they will no doubt be very high on confidence, and know that a win this weekend will put them just four points away from guaranteed second place, with three games left to play. At home, they have dropped just 10 points this season, which is the joint second best record in the league with Arsenal.
Arsenal have also found a good run of form recently, and no doubt all eyes will be on Arsene Wenger as he prepares for his last six, possibly seven, games as Arsenal manager. With a tough Europa League semifinal leg against Atletico Madrid on either side of this game, it will be interesting to see how things pan out in their important home leg this Thursday where a big win could influence the team selection for the weekend. They have only lost one of their last nine, with that being a 2-1 loss to a surprisingly tough Newcastle team. However, they have been horrendous away from home this season, picking up just 13 points from 16 away games in the league, but with 25 goals scored in their last nine games, they are in fine goalscoring form and they will be hoping to capitalise on that.
These two are very hard to separate, with three wins each and three draws in the last nine games. At home, United have had the beating of Arsenal every time bar one since 2006. I feel like United’s recent run of form, and Arsenal’s poor away form should lead to a United win.
Game played: Sunday 29th 4:30 p.m. (BST) / 11:30 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Manchester United win

Zenit v CSKA Moscow
Our second game sees us head to Russia for the first time since the first week of Matchups. With three games to go, the league title looks all but won by Lokomotiv Moscow, which leaves a very close four-way battle for the other four European competition spots. Two of those sides battle it out for a spot in the Champions League, with hosts Zenit sitting two points behind CSKA in fourth.
Zenit will be hoping for a good result to help them move above their opponents and into the Champions League spots, with third place Spartak Moscow suffering a blip in form and losing their last two games. They have accumulated a solid 26 points from 13 home games this season, losing and drawing before winning two against lower half teams. They will be desperate to pick up a big win and three points here to help them stay in with a chance of reaching the Champions League, as they have a very tough away game next weekend against league leaders Lokomotiv Moscow.
CSKA have one of the best away records in the league this season, picking up 28 points from their 14 away games so far. Having been knocked out of the Europa League by Arsenal a few weeks ago, they have also been in a bit of a rut in terms of form with just two wins in their last six games in all competitions. Away from home, the haven’t lost in the league since the winter break, with two wins and a draw, but they are still lacking in defensive solidity with only one clean sheet in their last seven games.
This is a pretty even tie, with Zenit being the slight favourites for the bookies due to home advantage. CSKA have struggled against Zenit in the past few years with no wins in their last nine, while Zenit were victors on five occasions. However the past three games have ended in draws, which makes things that bit harder to call. I believe that Zenit’s home form will help them out, and may be enough to lead them to victory, but a draw seems to be the most likely result in my opinion.
Game played: Sunday 29th 2:30 p.m. (BST) / 9:30 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw

Real Sociedad v Athletic Bilbao
Next we head to Spain for a mid table clash with only pride and prize money to play for, rather than a Europa League spot like last season. 
Real Sociedad sit in a respectable 11th place as they head into the last four games, and can finish anywhere between 6th and 17th. They went on a run of three wins in a row which will no doubt have helped them massively, but a demoralizing defeat to the already relegated bottom side Malaga last week may knock them a bit. At home they have lost just one of the last seven, that being to Europa League chasing Getafe. They have the third best scoring record at home in the league, with only Real Madrid and Barcelona scoring more than them. However, only Betis and Las Palmas have conceded more than them at home, which makes this game look like it could be a high scoring encounter.
Bilbao are still looking for their 10th win of the season, and have the joint most draws in the league this season with 13. Away from home they have struggled this season, picking up just 17 points in 17 away games, and have won just one of their last six, and picked up seven or their last 30 available points. I'd imagine that they are just wanting this season to end so they can regroup and come out fighting to get back into the European competitions next year. 
Bilbao can have some confidence coming into this game as they have only lost once to Sociedad in their last eight meetings, but they have only won twice. I feel like Sociedad have the advantage this time though, being at home and in far better form, so I am going for a home win. 
Game played: Sunday 28th 3:15 p.m. (BST) / 10:15 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Real Sociedad win

Galatasaray v Besiktas
Our last game comes from Turkey, where first and second battle it out in a potential title decider with just four games to play. 
Hosts Galatasaray sit one point ahead of Besiktas and Basaksehir, and will be looking to extend their lead as they head into the crucial last few weeks of the season. They haven’t been in the greatest form recently, losing twice and drawing once in their last six games, including a loss at home to Akhisar Genclik Spor in the cup semifinal last week. However, their home form this season has been excellent, only dropping points in a 0-0 draw against bitter rivals Fenerbahce back in October.
Besiktas will be hoping to move to the top of the league for the first time of the season with a big win this weekend. They come into the game on a four game winning streak, scoring 12 and conceding 2 in that run. However their away form hasn’t been great, with just four wins in their last 12 on the road.
These two last met in December in another Matchups game, with Besiktas coming out on top with a comfortable 3-0 win to extend their unbeaten run against Galatasaray to six games. However Galatasaray’s home form is just too impressive for this to be an easy Besiktas win. Combine that with Besiktas’ poor away record, I feel like this will be another home win with Gala just overwhelming Besiktas on the day.
Game played: Sunday 29th 5:00 p.m. (BST) / 12:00 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Galatasaray

That’s what I think might happen this week, with a good mix of games to try and predict this week. As a reward, you can pick yourself up an 85 Overall Younes Belhanda, or some ever important training XP to help you boost your team.
As always, good luck and happy predicting!"

One of FIFA 18's most anticipated promotions of the game is here: FUT Birthday.
Celebrating nine years of FIFA Ultimate Team, FUT Birthday blends retro-out-of-position player items, Squad Building Challenges, Lightning Rounds, and more in one of the better non-Team of the Season promos of the last several FUTs.
The squad delivers as advertised this FIFA.
95 RW Cristiano Ronaldo, 90 LB Gareth Bale, and 92 RW Eden Hazard headline the hybrid-friendly throwback FUT items, available in packs for the next 10 days (all the way until March 26, 18:00 UTC).
There's also plenty of FUT Birthday SBCs, including loan and untradeable turn-back-the-clock versions of Wayne Rooney, Yaya Toure, Bastian Schweinsteiger, and Robin Van Persie.
While the ratings for those ""Premium SBCs"" don't quite match those of FUT 17's promo, they're far, far cheaper -- if you recall, the number one complaint last year was the outlandishly steep prices. You'll have to complete Weekly Objectives before you can finish them and in a twist, only be able to complete a limited number of them, however.
And speaking of those Weekly Objectives, FIFA's annual Saint Patrick's Day event is rolled into one with this year's FUT Birthday. Aiden McGeady, Harry Arter, Daryl Horgan, Seamus Coleman, and fresh off a 40/40 last Weekend League, David Meyler are all available in untradeable boosted player items, which are required for the FUT Birthday SBCs.
While the Premium SBC's grind-driven aspect and relatively affordable prices will appeal to some, they might also be off putting to the most hardcore collectors, who may have wanted to keep some of the St. Patty's items, or for the real blue bloods, complete all the Premium SBCs.
With a full 10 days to come in this promotion, there's still plenty more ahead, including an End of an Era Kaka and other twists and turns yet to come. Whatever your gut reaction to the promo is, this may be one where the full tale of the tape is told at the end."

For those who have followed my work for a while on both Futhead and FUT Nation, you may know of our working relationship and occasional partnership with the FIFA Mobile YouTuber JoeBilineHD. In our latest collaboration, we look at the potential release of the MLS All-Stars in FIFA Mobile.
With the match between the MLS All-Stars and Real Madrid being played next Tuesday (August 2) in Chicago, and FM Producer Todd ""King Bitty"" Batty teasing us about a new Promo this Friday, the release of something related to the annual MLS All-Star Game seems almost inevitable.
However, as we have seen with FUTTIES, the FIFA Mobile team does not include all of the same promotional events as that of their console counterparts, so how the MLS All-Stars are represented in FIFA Mobile remains to be seen.
Hopefully we'll be able to see the 23 squad members who are in the game in FM, but don't expect it to necessarily happen in the exact same way as it does each year on console, especially after EA teased us with this interesting photo last night.
With some players already having excellent cards such as Sebastian Giovinco, Bastian Schweinsteiger, and obviously the Vs Attack Master Kaka, further upgraded versions which may even provide boosts to others, will be a welcome addition to any team.
To see a more visual representation of the prediction, make sure to head over to Joe's YouTube channel to see his view on the subject, as well as a prediction into how the cards will look in his video.
Below, you can see the ratings which we have predicted for each of the 23 MLS All-Stars:

DaMarcus Beasley (LB) 90

We knew FIFA Ultimate Team's Team of the Week 5 probably wouldn't live up to quite the standards of the first couple, but we hoped for at least one pleasant surprise Wednesday afternoon/morning none the less. We got more than a few.
Despite predictions showing what looked to be a relatively low key squad heading into the release, the official TOTW includes the best keeper in England, David De Gea, crosstown rival striker Gabriel Jesus (plus teammate Raheem Sterling), Bayern's superstar duo of Thiago Alcantara and Joshua Kimmich, as well as Milan Derby hero, Mauro Icardi. Not bad for a ""down"" week, huh?
While there are no purple heroes, record breakers, or otherwise this time, if we see more pack promotions through the weekend like we did on Tuesday, it's possible this TOTW could add some spice to the FUT ecosystem's squad makeups.
Here's the full FUT 18 Team of the Week 5:"

With an offseason of transactional news of comings and goings in the competitive FIFA scene, it's only appropriate that another big club makes another notable move before qualifying season gets underway.
Recent European competitive staple Simon 'Zimme' Nystedt of Sweden is the latest to make a big move, officially becoming a AS Roma eSports player. Zimme joins Sam 'Poacher' Carmody and Nicoló 'Insa' Mirra representing the massive Italian club at official FIFA tournaments and events.
Zimme, an 18 year old hailing from Eskilstuna, Sweden, has been playing FIFA profesionally since 2015. He reached the finals of the European Regional Qualifiers of the FIWC in 2017, has regularly competed in the Swedish FIFA championships at the time of his move is currently ranked as the second best FIFA player in his home country.
Though not an Ultimate Team Championship qualifying event, the ESWC PGW FIFA18 Challenge will mark the informal beginning of the FUT 18 competitive calendar November 3-5 in Paris, France. We'll have to see if any of the Roma players start their runs there or if their focus is on the presumed beginning of FUT Champions Weekend League qualifying that weekend.

FIFA’s annual biggest event of the year is here. Team of the Season, better known in the community as TOTS, recognizes and honors the best individual performances across Europe and the world’s top football leagues during 2017/2018. Over the course of the next month, weekly (and in some cases biweekly) releases will include overpowered special player items, unlockable untradeable Team of the Season items, and much, much more.
Appropriately, the festivities kick off Friday, 27 April with the Community team, previously known as TOTS Most Consistent Without an Inform. As voted by FIFA devotees across our site and FUTWIZ, this side includes twenty three of the better peformances that didn’t quite earn a weekly TOTW nod during the course of the first 30-some-odd weeks of the season.
Amongst the standouts in both rating and recognition, Juventus’ ageless Giorgio Chiellini, FC Barcelona’s Gerard Pique, Napoli’s Marek Hamsik, and Atletico Madrid’s part-man part-wall Jan Oblak lead the way in the one of the higher-rated Community teams in FUT history.
But those aren’t the only blues you’ll be able to pack this weekend. In a shift from recent release calendars, the EFL Team of the Season (aka the “Lower League TOTS”) comes out three days early, bringing the best of the sub-Premier League standouts from the UK.
Award winners Ryan Sessegnon, Bradley Dack, and Billy Kee all see their respective Player of the Year items re-released, now as tradeable blues. They’re joined by the man many felt should have earned the Championship POTY honors, Ruben Neves, along with Souleymane Bamba. And we’d be remiss if we didn’t mention friend of Futhead, the beast himself, Adebayo Akinfenwa. A worth recipient of a blue-and-gold special item after a phenomenal year.

Irishmen, shamrocks, lucky leaves … sound familiar? The popular St Patrick’s Day promotion returns to FIFA Mobile in a pack-only program. Twelve 85-92 tradable green-garbed/Irish players headline this weekend-long event covering all positions except LF/RF, LW/RW and LWB/RWB.
The Players
S1 veterans will remember Evertonian Séamus Coleman’s 99 RB item from last year’s St Patrick’s Day, and he leads the St Patrick’s Day contingent this year with a 92 RB item. The second 92 OVR defender after VSA Bailly, Coleman is tradable straight away so be prepared for full RU3 defences in the near future. If you can pack him yourself, you could be looking at a tidy profit due to his high demand amongst the elite players. Joining EPL compatriots David de Gea and Petr Čech as a 91 GK is Southampton goalie Fraser Forster -- another former S1 St Patty’s player who earned a Retro Star item late in S1 that was a mainstay of many a side. 
With the nostalgia over, William Carvalho picks up his second special item with a 90 CM item in his striped green Sporting CP kit. Northern Ireland’s defensive bulwark Jonny Evans showcases an 89 CB item, with Republic of Ireland marksman Shane Long leading the line with an 88 ST item. Lokomotiv Moscow’s Manuel Fernandes collects an 88 LM item, and green-kitted Portland Timbers are represented by Diego Valeri’s 87 CAM item. Marc Bartra’s return to Spain in the summer allows him to represent Real Betis as an 87 CB item, while green garbed Fin Bartels of Werder Bremen has an 86 CF item. The remaining three are Irishmen: Burnley’s Stephen Ward with an 86 LB item, Celtic’s Jonny Hayes’ 85 RM item, and Shamrock Rover’s new signing Greg Bolger with a massive +22 upgrade bump to an 85 CDM item.
The Packs
If you were hoping for a stamina-based program to grind your frustrations away, you’re out of luck. St Patrick’s is a pack-only program, so focus your desires in that department into the newly revamped VsA mode. 
There are two main packs you should be worried about for St Patrick’s Day -- the 500k coins/1k FP single pack, and the 10k bundle. The 500k/1k packs award one random Golden Shamrock and 10 Lucky Leaves with a CHANCE at any of the St Patrick’s Day players, while the bundle will earn you the green suit St Patrick’s Day kit on first purchase, plus two random Golden Shamrocks. There are 12 different Golden Shamrocks numbered accordingly, and each Shamrock is used on an individual player pack. Player packs cost one specific Shamrock or a set number of Lucky Leaves, and reward either 1-5 Lucky Leaves or their specified player, the full list can be seen in the table below. Opening Coleman's Chance pack will award a St Patrick's Day logo the first time you buy it.

Hang on, what about the coin packs? What’s the pack limit? EA are screwing over F2P!! Before you start ranting, the great part about St Patrick’s Day packs is that there is no limit on coin pack purchases, so if you’ve been saving coins since Lunar New Year or Carniball, open as many packs as you like.
Summary
No SBs, no coins, no XP? St Patrick’s looks like a coin sink ahead of SBCs release, with the added effect of flooding the market with more 85+ Elites. Hopefully this will cause the market prices of low Elites to decline which will allow more players to complete SBCs. The players themselves may appeal to their respective teams’ fans, and feature even more fantastic card art. Greg Bolger at 120 has the third highest stat total of all FIFA Mobile players behind Prime Matthaüs and End of an Era Pirlo and could well be a popular option at CDM with his 63 base item making for cheap Rank Ups. 
Using Fraser Forster’s 76 base item as a duplicate could also make him a popular cheap option to Rank Up, while Séamus Coleman is expected to be very desirable for Rank Ups as the only tradable 92 defender. With SBCs and an expected EAster event on the horizon, it may be wise to sit this one out unless you’re looking for a specific player. All players are tradable right from the get go, so perhaps look to pick them up off the market instead of chancing your arm with packs."

FIFA 18's new gameplay features aren't necessarily ones everyone had been thinking about, but we certainly won't be able to live without them in the future.
Put your Romelu Lukaku jokes to bed, because 18's player motion promises to have ""more defined touches,"" in addition to ""tighter turns and explosive transitions."" When you make a run with Ronaldo, it'll feel more like Ronaldo.
More defined touches, tighter turns and explosive transitions. This is dribbling in #FIFA18. https://t.co/pBOUpJwDq3 pic.twitter.com/iFjfxykbte— EA SPORTS FIFA (@EASPORTSFIFA) July 23, 2017

Per EA, this year they've also worked extensively on team styles and player positioning, ensuring that movement off-the-ball, such as supported runs and hold-up play, is much more fluid. Now, you can directly support your target man or send through-balls that have already been anticipated. Playing the ball out wide also brings more enhanced options now.

Moreover, authentic team styles have been introduced, including the ""Catenaccio."" Meaning ""door-bolt"" in Italian, the tactical system places its primary emphasis on defending; it's most recognizable contribution to the game thus far has been the introduction of a free defender, or ""libero."" Think David Luiz in Antonio Conte's three-at-the-back system.
So now, you FIFA players that have the tendency to bomb forward with your 80-Pace center-backs will have a bit more insurance when the impending counter-attack comes."

A huge change to VS Attack rewards has finally arrived after being hyped for the past week or so. A reward system very similar to that used for End of an Era earlier this season should hopefully revitalise a mode scorned by many a player. Combined with updates to gameplay scenarios, VSA should feel like a brand new mode for new and old players alike.
The Players
53 base Season 1 VSA players are available as Chances throughout the VSA reward chapter, and through packs in the store, while 7 Prime Season 1 VSA players are scattered amongst the World Class, Legendary, and FIFA Champion division rewards. On top of them all is Gullit Gang’s much loved leader, Prime Icon Ruud Gullit’s 97 CM item’s shaggy dreadlocks await those willing to spend big on packs.
Feyenoord’s Jean-Paul Boëtius’ 86 LW is the first Prime Season 1 VSA player at VSA Level 32 on the World Class Premium path, and is followed on the Free path by VSA Level 41 by Wolverhampton Wanderers’ 87 Ivan Cavaleiro on the opposite wing. Moving onto Legendary division rewards, Getafe’s Vincente Guiata has an 88 GK item at VSA Level 54 on the Premium Path with Inter’s Antonio Candreva rocking an 89 RM item at VSA Level 65 on the Free Path. Rounding out the Legendary player rewards is PSG’s Layvin Kurzawa on the Premium Path. Requiring VSA Level 68, Kurzawa’s 90 LB doesn’t quite match up to TOTY Marcelo but is nonetheless a very nice item.
If you’ve been following Darren8196’s Mobile Matchup predictions each week, you’ll have noticed his profile picture is none other than Raphaël Guerreiro. Hopefully Guerreiro’s 91 CM item can spur Darren to get some more predictions right so you can all get your hands on those Matchup players, but he’ll require VSA Level 80, albeit on the Free path. Finally Season 1 legend Eric Bailly showcases a 92 CB item at VSA Bonus Level 10. Just the second CB after Matchup’s Sven Bender to utilise the Holding Skill Boost, Bailly has 94 Pace, 101 Defending and 107 Physical unboosted, and joins the exclusive 41-member club of rainbowing CBs at 120OVR, stats that would’ve been very handy in Manchester United’s Champions League loss to Sevilla. Bailly requires at least forty 1000FP packs on top of the FIFA Champions pass, so will not come cheap.
Packs
Every week twenty 1000FP VSA packs are available in the Store that will reward you with 3 base VSA players and 5 VSA points. There is also a once per season VSA Special Pack as an in-app purchase that gives 15 VSA points and 10 base VSA players. For each Division (Pro, World Class, Legendary, and FIFA Champion), a Division pass for that Season is available. This pass unlocks the Premium path for that division’s rewards. These can be bought retroactively -- even when you have passed that division -- and all previously passed rewards can be claimed. The FIFA Champion pass is needed for all the Bonus Rewards including Prime Gullit and 92 Bailly.
Guide
Regardless of your division, you can earn a maximum of 15 VSA points per day -- 5 from your first VSA win of the day, and then 10 more from playing 5 matches. These 5 matches count towards your Daily Activities as well, so don’t forget to claim them. If you play your 5 a day, and are in FIFA Champion at the end of the season, you will have 450 VSA points, enough to claim all Free path rewards, plus any Premium path rewards you have unlocked through their respective passes. To get Bonus Rewards, you will have to spend on packs, the first Bonus Reward of 2.5 million coins requires the FC pass as well as at least 4k FP in VSA packs (or 1k FP and the VSA Special Pack). A summary table can be seen below:

My advice is to play your 5 a day and see where you end up. If you are looking at buying a Division pass, the FC pass will reward 500 SBs, 150k VSA XP and the VSA S1 FC Logo. The 500 SBs alone make this pass worthwhile and if you have saved up FP you should consider going for the Bonus Reward 1 of 2.5 million coins too. The Pro pass isn’t very flashy, but will land you two Elite players, who could come in handy for SBCs. Similarly, the WC pass gives Boëtius 87 and 2 Elite players. The Legendary pass offers 1 Elite player, but also includes 225k coins, 88 Guaita and a possible Rank Up token in 90 Kurzawa.
Summary
The VSA revamp breathes new life into a much neglected mode of FIFA Mobile. Building on the popular -- but tiring -- End of an Era program, 24 hour cycles instead of 6 hour cycles make VSA actually viable to play again. Playing 5 matches a day and ending in FIFA Champion will reward you with 4 Elites, 87 Cavaleiro, 89 Candreva and 91 Guerreiro F2P, with other rewards along the way. Tournament Vouchers offered as rewards hint towards the return of Weekend Tournaments in the near future, and the full contingent of 60 VSA Season 1 players allows for some fan favourite players to earn special items."

If you were hoping, wishing, praying for a non-Premier League FUTTIES Winner, today is a banner day.
Alessandro Florenzi held off Moussa Sissoko to get a position-swap winner item -- and what an item it is. If you're looking for a Weekend League super sub or love rolling with a ""Calcio A"" squad, Florenzi looks like a potential necessity to build.
This weekend's nominees are CM-heavy again -- this time with actually native-playing center midfielders. Spurs' Moussa Dembele looks for Tottenham-Moussa revenge against a field that includes fellow PL Everton CM Idrissa Gueye and early FUT 17 Weekend League favorite, Renato Sanches. Sanches may want away from Bayern in real life, but he'll be a popular choice and could produce the second straight non-PL FUTTIES winner.
If you've got a case for any of the three nominees, we're eager to hear it. You can also find out all the latest Squad Building Challenges info here."

FIFA Mobile's Team of the Season kicks off with the release of the EFL and Community TOTS, mirroring console's release. Taking elements from just about every promotion so far, TOTS looks to be one of the most satisfying promotions yet. Your choice of just about any Starter from any TOTS if you play daily, and potentially more with coin packs and if you get lucky with drop rates. An abundance of Elites and Masters who will slot right into your Starting XI or end up as SBC fodder, how you use them is up to you, but be prepared for 6 weeks of TOTS events.
To start this week off we'll have a look at main TOTS chapter and the EFL TOTS, then the Community TOTS -- as voted for by the community right here on Futhead -- and the TOTS campaigns.
MAIN CHAPTER
The TOTS Main Chapter follows on from the EAster model, 8-hour cycles with 'repeatable' Skill Games and a VsA match. There's also an ad to watch every 8 hours to earn more TOTS Vouchers. Every 8 hours two Skill Games are available, the first guarantees 3 TOTS Vouchers, and the second can be repeated up to 10 times each with a good chance at a TOTS Voucher or 1500 coins. One VsA match will also be playable and will match make by OVR, so use it to try out some new squads or test you WT team. Once you win the VsA match, you’ll earn 2 TOTS Vouchers, and the match will lock until the next cycle. As mentioned earlier, an advert can also be watched to earn 1 TOTS Voucher. This means you can get a guaranteed 6 TOTS Vouchers every 8 hours, and you should be able to get around 2-4 more from the grinding event.
TOTS Vouchers are used to purchase TOTS points of your choosing. Whether you go all out straight away into Community TOTS points, or save your Vouchers for La Liga TOTS points, you choose what you want. 3 Vouchers will get you any one TOTS point – only Community TOTS points are available at the moment, the rest will unlock weekly – plus a chance at a random EFL TOTS player.
EFL TOTS
If you're not familiar with some of these players, you will be by the end of TOTS. EFL TOTS players are available throughout the TOTS promotion as Chances wherever ‘TOTS items’ appear, and as Chances when buying TOTS points with Vouchers. Unlike the regular TOTS players, all EFL TOTS players are tradeable from the get go, look out for EFL Championship POTY 87 LW Ryan Sessegnon and 86 CDM Ruben Neves for some high-supply beasts. Also featured are EFL League 1 POTY 80 CAM Bradley Dack, EFL League 2 POTY 80 ST Billy Kee, and the beast that is 77 ST Adebayo Akinfenwa. EFL TOTS players are useful for transferring the plethora of TOTS XP you’ll earn through packs, and also for use in the special TOTS League SBCs.
CAMPAIGNS
Asides from the EFL TOTS, every TOTS will have a Campaign chapter where you can obtain any Starter from that League. If you’re desperate for a player you think will come in a future TOTS, you can save your TOTS Vouchers for that league and focus on spending your Vouchers on those TOTS League points. Styled like Lunar New Year and TOTY, each Campaign has a straight ‘Main’ path, and 11 side paths corresponding to each individual member of that League TOTS’s Starting XI. Main Path nodes are relatively cheap compared to Side Path nodes, all of which reward 50k coins, 10k XP or 20 SB per TOTS point used. There are also 3 of that League’s TOTS Reserves spread out along the Main Paths, keep an eye out for these. To access players’ Side Paths, you’ll need to progress along the Main Path, don’t worry about going too far as the Side Paths are only 3 nodes each and you don’t have to scroll to see where you are. Along each League’s Main Path is also a League-specific TOTS logo for collection. 
Community TOTS
Throughout FIFA Mobile, Team of the Week events have rewarded players whose real-life performances were particularly good, however some consistently high performing players haven’t had any singular games where they were considered to be playing at a level to earn an in-form. The best of these were collated into a shortlist you were able to vote for on Futhead, and those receiving the most votes have made it into your Community TOTS. All TOTS Reserves are tradeable straight away, while TOTS Starters will become tradeable after June 5.
Leading the line for cTOTS's Starting XI are Leicester front man and the Premier League’s highest scoring English striker not named Harry Kane, 88 ST Jamie Vardy and CONCACAF Champions League runner-up 90 CF Sebastian Giovinco. The Italian was one of my favourite players in Season 1,
the Toronto star’s cTOTS item will bring back memories of his Retro Star CF and should please anyone who obtains him. The headlining 91 OVR players are Juventus’ Italian colossus Giorgio Chiellini – his 91 CB item should be a good compromise to those who didn’t manage 25 wins last weekend and missed out on his 93 CB WT item – Atlético Madrid’s GK Jan Oblak who’s played a vital part in maintaining Atlético's lowest Goals Against in La Liga, and Napoli captain Marek Hamšik also grabs a 91 OVR item at CM. Gerard Piqué’s expert marshalling of Barcelona’s backline earns him a 90 CB item as he looks to carry his form into the World Cup with Spain.
The Community TOTS Campaign is laid out by OVR, meaning Adrien Rabiot’s 86 CM item costs the least cTOTS points, and Chiellini/Hamšik/Oblak cost the most. Also in the cTOTS campaign is a Mystery SBC, the equivalent of console's DKT reward. Eagle eyed observers will have noticed this 24th cTOTS player is none other than José Callejon, whose SBC will be revealed on Tuesday for FIFA Mobile. These 24th player SBCs will be relatively cheap involving TOTS players (EFL TOTS players will be very useful here). Keep an eye out in case it’s someone you want. You can obtain the cTOTS Reserves through the Main Path in the cTOTS Campaign, or through packs in the Store.
cTOTS players who feature in their own League's TOTS will receive a different item in their League's TOTS, so if you think a cTOTS Starter might be a Starter for their League's TOTS, think about saving your TOTS Vouchers for that League's release - they'll have a higher base OVR and higher stats too.
Packs
Two cTOTS 500k coin packs will be available in the Store that will give 2 cTOTS points, and 5 TOTS items. These can include cTOTS players, EFL TOTS players, TOTS XP, and TOTS Vouchers. TOTS players have the same XP thresholds as their base items, so could be very useful as Rank Up tokens or used to transfer XP to your other players. You can also purchase an unlimited amount of these packs for 1k FP each. The 10k Bundle on offer will give you a Kit on your first purchase of a bundle, 3 extra TOTS points for that League, and a random TOTS player from the associated League.
Each League will also have a special in-app purchase offer that will give 15 of that League’s TOTS points, as well as an associated Chain Pack as well. An in-app purchase for the first pack in the chain will give you 5 TOTS items associated with that League, unlocking the second 500FP pack. This pack will give you one of that League’s TOTS Reserve and unlock the 2k FP pack which gives 100 Vouchers (~33 TOTS points). Following this is a 5k FP pack with 35 of that League’s TOTS points. Finally, the 10k FP crowning offer will earn you a 90+ TOTS Master.
Summary
The cTOTS format looks to be the same for the remaining leagues' TOTS, so planning in advance for your favourite league means you'll be able to get who you want. Stretched out over 6 weeks, you should be able to earn at least 1 Starter of your choosing, plus coins/XP/SBs and other players along the way. Lots to do daily and a huge influx of XP through packs should see your team's OVR increase throughout TOTS. TOTS is always one of the most highly anticipated events in FIFA, and FIFA Mobile 18's TOTS meets expectations and more."

Everyone who plays FIFA has been there. You're up by a goal (or two) late in a match. All the momentum -- actual, not the tin-foil-hat stuff -- is working in your favor. Surely you're but 20, 25 minutes away from a sure-fire big-time W. But your CAM is sluggish. Or maybe your CDM is getting beat off the line in a way he didn't before.
You reluctantly pause to make a substitution. And then your teammate does too. Or maybe if they don't, the break allows them to clear their mind, regather their emotions, and dig just deep enough to find the equalizer and eventually win on penalties (or sometimes as gutting, get the go ahead decisive goal in regulation or extra time).
FIFA 18 is set to remedy that (or at least mitigate it a touch). In a new feature so good you'll wonder how it wasn't already there already, you're now able to preset ""Quick Substitions"" and make those in-game during stoppages in play. The overlay is optional/skippable, in case you're of the no-subs-ever mentality. But if you're that type that preplans to take Khedira off for Kanté in the 71' every game, you can preset that sub and make it as need be without giving your opponent the mental cue to answer or get their act together.
It's a little touch, but when you play FIFA 18, you'll understand why tactially it's such a big deal this year. Who knows. Given some of the ways pauses have impacted FUT Champions finals matches in the past, it might just wind up helping shape the outcome of a big competitive FIFA game this coming year as well."

                        To say this is a stacked side would be an understatement with seven players rated 86 or above alongside two OTW items for good measure.
                    

Last weeks score 14/23
Formation: 3-4-2-1 - http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/4392812/

Goalkeeper
Sergio Asenjo - GK - 81 OVR
Despite only recently picking up his first IF the Spaniard looks set for another boost after his performance on Sunday. Asenjo put in another stellar shift producing four saves in total which included a Nasri penalty in order to help Villarreal pick up a point in their 0-0 draw with Sevilla.
Defenders
Thiago Silva - CB - 89 OVR
In previous years we have seen the bias present towards Silva with various random selections to his name and now that EA are seemingly being very lenient towards the big names I think that this is the perfect time for him. The Brazilian defender scored one of PSG's three goals in their 3-1 away win over Dijon which saw him claim MOTM with a 7/10 from L'equipe.
Andrea Ranocchia - CB - 76 OVR
Under new management Hull have looked like an entirely different side, especially while playing at home. An impressive 2-0 win over Liverpool was the result this weekend and new signing Ranocchia was the stand out player doing superbly at the back alongside picking up an assist for good measure.
Sokratis - CB - 84 OVR
Due to the caliber of the match I believe that we will be seeing a Dortmund IF for their important 1-0 win over the surprising Liepzeg. Sokratis picked up MOTM for his strong defensive performance with a 1.5 from kicker which should be enough to see him in.
Cristian Tello - RWB - 78 OVR
RWB is the new LM in terms of Fifa IF's and Tello could well be the next player to receive that treatment after scoring twice from a wing-back role. Fiorentina went on to win the match 2-1 with Tello claiming MOTM with a 7.5
Midfielders
Marek Hamsik - CM - 85 OVR
The first of two Napoli players to make the cut, both of which are top tier players is Hamsik. The Slovakian scored the 1st, 5th and 6th Napoli goals as the cruised to a 7-1 victory away at Bologna. Personally Hamsik is one of my favourite players on this game so if you have the coins I will strongly vouch for him.
Marco Parolo - CM - 81 OVR
Continuing on the theme of high scoring Italian games Lazio played out a 6-2 away win over Pescara. Parolo was the man to run the show scoring an impressive four goals from midfield. Another one which is limited due to his SBC though.
Henrikh Mkhitaryan - LM - 85 OVR
Leicester really are in trouble this season and at this rate could fall into a relegation battle after winning the title which is crazy thinking about it. Manchester United added more misery to them with a comfortable 3-0 win of which Mkhitaryan impressed with both a goal and assist to his name.
Forwards
Dries Mertens - ST - 83 OVR
Mertens is now getting towards the point of being the most overpowered item in FIFA. The Belgian is in the form of his life right now which saw him score another three goals to take his tally to for the season during Napoli's previously mentioned 7-1 win at Bologna.
Romelu Lukaku - ST - 84 OVR
Lukaku is a player which often goes through patchy streaks in terms of goals but when hes on his game he is pretty much unplayable. Bournemouth were on the opposing end of that on Saturday which saw the Everton striker score four goals in their 6-3 thriller.
Fernando Torres- ST - 81 OVR
Whenever the name Torres appears I instantly think of his prime which despite the slack he gets now was simply on another level. Every now and then you get to see traces of his past so its always good to see him doing well. The Spaniard scored both Atletico goals in their 2-0 win on Saturday, pouncing on a missed Griezmann penalty before calmly chipping the keeper to round of the match.
Substitutes
Remy Vercoutre - GK - 77 OVR
For the second consecutive week we look set to be picking up two gold keepers. The second is Vercoutre after the Caen stopper managed to record an 8/10 from L'equipe for his four saves in their 1-0 away win against Guingamp.
Kyriakos Papadopoulos - CB - 79 OVR
Last weeks side had the highest about of golds I have seen in a side thus far and I feel as though with the amount of top performances from golds once again we could be seeing a similar story unfold. Papadopoulos scored the only goal of the game for Hamburg in a 1-0 win over Leverkusen.
Mohamed Elyounoussi - RM - 72 OVR
The Swiss league returned back to action this weekend and we have an all familiar side popping up for an IF in Basel. Elyounoussi was the stand out player for them scoring three of their four goals in a routine 4-0 win against Lugano.
David Edwards - RM - 69 OVR
Considering the sheer amount of mid-week games it may come as a surprise that the only one I have included comes from a Wolves midfielder. That is the case though after Edwards scored twice and assisted another as Wolves continued their momentum from a shock win over Liverpool with a 3-1 win over Barnsley.
Brendon Santalab - ST - 63 OVR
One of the players I am least confident on is Santalab purely down to the fact A-League is often snubbed rather than his performance. The WSW striker was involved in all three of their goals finding the net twice for himself as well as assisting Martinez for the other.
Moussa Dembele - ST - 71 OVR
There has been a lot of transfer speculation surrounding Dembele which is probably the reason that he was benched for the start of the Celtic match. With the hoops trailing 2-1 in the 60th minute on came the Frenchman though and thus showed why clubs are interested in him by scoring three times to help Celtic turn it around and win 5-2.
Tiquinho Soares - ST - 71 OVR
One of the bigger games in Portugal saw Porto come away as 2-1 winners over Sporting Lisbon. It is often the case that an IF is produced from these matches and thus I believe that Soares who scored both the goals and claimed a 9/10 from Abola will be the man receiving the spot.
Reserves
Benjamin Mendy - LB - 75 OVR
Monaco remained at the top of the Ligue 1 table thanks to a 3-0 win over another title contender in Nice. There are two real options for the IF, firstly Falcao who found himself on the score-sheet twice once again. I have gone for a defensive option in Mendy however after he chipped in with two assists.
M'Baye Niang - RW - 78 OVR
The first of two OTW items I have decided to include is Niang and although he is on par with several other options I believe with the new OTW items he shall get the nod. The Frenchman scored once and assisted another on his debut for the Hornets to help guide them to three points over Burnley.
Raul Bobadilla - ST - 78 OVR
A bit of a punt now seeing as on paper he only got a goal and an assist but seeing as he picked up player of the week for the Bundesliga. The Paraguayan assisted the first before scoring one of his own in the 94th minute to secure a 3-2 win.
Jermain Defoe - ST - 80 OVR
Sunderland recorded what is likely to be their biggest win of the season, winning 4-0 away to Palace. Defoe scored two of those goals to keep his impressive tally going which could be set to see him with an 85 rated item.
Gabriel Jesus - ST - 78 OVR
Eyes were raised when Pep made the decision to start Jesus over Aguero for a second consecutive game but his faith was shown with the young Brazilian scoring both City goals. The second of which game in the 93rd minute to secure their 2-1 win."

                        Let’s be honest, last week was a bit of a disappointment. Despite speculation, EA had no significant promotions for us. However, some choose to see the glass as half full, citing that the lack of promotions gave the market a bit of respite, helping to slow the pace at which player prices were falling. Let’s take a look back at the last seven days, which despite the lack of official content, still managed to be eventful. Then we’ll talk about this coming week and wrap up with how to make coins.
                    

Overall, prices stabilized after tumbling last week. Well, at least most of them. Thanks to the weekend league requirements for this weekend (which essentially require a Premier League team) and the next (which will require exactly 18 players in your starting 11 and bench to be from the Bundesliga and/or Liga Santander) the prices of many high end cards not from those leagues continued to drop, or remain ridiculously low. This also applies to legends, which, on aggregate, are down roughly 10% since last week. 
Early in the week we were disappointed to discover that we would not be getting winter upgrades that Friday. However, much of that disappointment was quelled by a Dele Alli POTM SBC. Rumor has it that he’s a highly effective CAM, and at 70-85k many consider him a steal. This SBC pushed the prices of many silver cards from MK Dons well into the 10k range. If you haven’t yet checked your club for them, it’s worth a look. Of note was the new curveball requirement that EA added which asked players to exchange a squad featuring players from teams that Alli scored against in January. Something to keep in mind for the future. 

As we discussed last week, thanks to Premier League WL requirement, the prices of many high calibre Premier League players rose throughout the week. Unfortunately for many investors, the window to sell was quite small thanks to the popularity of the investment and the Premier League’s poor short term price prospects given next week’s WL requirements. That meant that cards with high card weight (Kante, Smalling, Walker, etc.) suffered from panic selling during non-peak hours. At the end of the day, many were disappointed to find themselves barely breaking even. However, those that decided to invest in cards with lower card weight such as MOTM Son or IF Reid, were able to sell during peak hours at significant premiums. 
Keeping this in mind, on the 11th we discovered that next week’s WL will require that exactly 18 players in your starting 11 and bench be from the Bundesliga and/or Liga Santander. We’ll talk more about this in the coin making section. 

Unfortunately, Valentine’s Day was a major let down this year. After the big day passed us by with no promotion, many investors were forced to take heavy losses on Hearts players which were hyped up as popular investments for SBCs.

Contrary to what my tweet claims (shameless plug for my twitter), to be fair to EA, they didn’t do “nothing.” Instead of a FUT based promotion, they released a video of them doing a real life skill game challenge with a number of Chelsea players. In it, much to the amusement of his jeering teammates, Batshuayi showed off his 59 passing in style by missing the target by a solid 10 yards. 

But, this week wasn’t all bad news for investors. Many were able to sell their OTW investments at significant premiums once one of their players started/assisted/scored in the games this week. As we discussed was a possibility last week, Mane got an inform for his performance against Spurs that pushed his OTW from an 82 to an 86 rated card. The massive stat boost saw his price jump from 119k to well over 300k. Albeit, the rise in price was a bit delayed as many investors were impatiently listing their OTW Mane’s at prices that were lower than the going rate of his 86 IF. That ridiculousness made about as much sense as Draxler’s price rising in reaction to his performance against Barca. Despite the fact that Champions League performances will never directly affect a OTW card (only TOTW cards can boost the ratings of OTW cards and EA don’t award TOTW cards for Champions Leagues performances), Draxler’s OTW card jumped in price and many were able to sell at inflated prices. In addition, Higuain grabbed another IF pushing his OTW to a 92 overall! With all these informs and the Calcio A League SBC that Higuain will get soon, will his TOTS finally be agile enough to use in WL? 

Also midweek, a number of FIFA fan favorites put in MOTM calibre performances for their clubs in various European competitions. This has lead many to believe that EA will release another batch of MOTM cards as they did not long ago. We’ll talk more about this possibility in the next section. 
Later in the week, the servers went down for maintenance, suggesting that winter upgrades were just around the corner. This rekindled the winter upgrade hype and the prices of many popular upgrade candidates jumped in price (Ex. 89 Cavani). Below is a picture of the message EA sent it’s users that @iGoldenBear posted on his twitter. 

As it turns out, this suspicion was correct. EA later announced on their website that we will be having a “Ratings Refresh” promotion launching on the 17th. We’ll talk more about this promotion in the following two sections. 
Then, out of nowhere, we were given two brand new SBCs, ‘Playing Abroad’ and ‘Foreign Players’ with no expiration date. Similar to other SBCs of this nature, their requirements were initially quite expensive costing about 38k and 7k respectively. However, as time goes on, their prices will dip significantly and they will be great ways to make some quick coins.
FUT - The Week Ahead
Onto the good stuff! This week is shaping up to be an interesting one. After holding our breath for the past two weeks, we are finally getting winter upgrades. We’ll talk about that and a potential batch of MOTM cards as we look to the week ahead. 
Ratings Refresh Promotion (February 17th - 27th)
EA announced on their website that, “Hundreds of players are getting their ratings permanently updated in FUT from February 17-27. 

Starting around 5:40 pm UK time, EA started upgrading a number of Premier League special cards in people’s clubs. After thoroughly spinning the rumor mill on twitter for an agonizing 20 minutes, they made an official announcement saying that over 60 Premier League players received upgrades. Some of the notable upgrades include a +3 boost to Mane, a +6 to Gueye, and a +2 to Kante.


Many of the stat upgrades were met with confusion however, with a number of big names such as Lukaku left out of the list. In the same post, they mentioned that the next league will be announced on Sunday. A quick look at their database suggests that the next league that we will see will be the Calcio A. That means that the Premier League will be the center of attention for 48 hours and then another league will take it’s place. It’s likely that EA will do something similar for the remaining leagues throughout the rest of the promotion.


They also posted their official rules for the upgrades on their website (see below). It will be important to understand these so that we can predict what will happen with the leagues coming out throughout the week. Let’s go over them...

One notable rule for investing is that if an upgraded gold card reaches the rating of his lowest IF, then, regardless of a rating gap, his other informs will be upgraded. This is significant because we weren’t sure if they would upgrade if there were gaps between IFs. They also said that they will be making some exceptions for IFs whose base card is low rated. This is why Mane’s OTW and other IF’s were upgraded to an 87 despite his gold card upgrade not reaching his lowest IF. This is significant because it means that other upgrade candidates in other leagues who would have had too much of a gap between their upgrade card and their inform under last year’s upgrade system, still have a chance to have their informs upgraded. A perfect example of this is OTW Dembele. Another strange bit of info is that Scream and Movember cards won’t be getting overall upgrades. However, they will be getting their stats boosted (Ex. Scream Bellerin). 
If you have any questions about how upgrades work, please don’t hesitate to ask them in the comment section of this article or on Twitter (@FUT_Economist). I will try to answer as many as I can.

Along with the upgrades, EA also released a SBC that guarantees 3 Premier League players. Considering that the SBC expires tomorrow, it seems likely that they will do this for the other leagues as well. 

New Batch of MOTM Cards
As we mentioned above, a number of WL favorites put in great performances for their clubs over the past week in European competitions. To celebrate this, EA released a batch of MOTM cards featuring the likes of Irba, Lacazette, and Di Maria. 

There is speculation that EA will release another batch next Friday after the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 wraps up. 
Making Coins this Week
As was mentioned earlier, prices of high end players seem to have bottomed out this week. While I don’t expect them to go much lower, the restrictive WL requirements will continue to put significant downward pressure on their prices if they are not required for that week. With this in mind, if you had any interest in picking up legends or high end informs from the leagues not required, now might be a great time. Let’s get into some more specific coin making tips.
Weekend League Requirements
Because of the difficulty in timing the selling of Premier League investments for this week’s WL requirements, many investors have shied away from investing in Bundesliga and Liga Santander players for next weekend. This is a good thing for those who have not yet invested, as it means we will be competing against fewer people when trying to sell later next week. Here are a couple things to consider if you want to invest for this;

Remember that hybrids are not required, and a player’s hybrid potential is only a bonus. If they aren’t WL calibre, they won’t be in demand for teams. 
Think about what team(s) you would make for this weekend if you wanted to be as competitive as possible. Invest in the player’s crucial to those team.
Remember what happened this week with the Premier League investments. You had to sell the lower rated players earlier in the week at peak times to beat other investors. Otherwise there were too many investors trying to unload full transfer lists at the same time for demand to outweigh supply.
Margins were far better on higher end players with low card weight. They also stayed more consistently expensive. It will likely be the same this coming week. 
A final thing to consider is that overall, this investment is a bit more risky. This is because you can choose from both leagues or even combine them, meaning that demand will be spread across a larger number of players. 

There is also a theory floating around that they will come out with WL requirements for the Calcio A and Ligue 1 the week following these requirements. If this were true, the earlier you could invest for something like that, the better. This will likely be revealed some point this weekend, so be on the lookout for that. 
In addition, on the back end of this Premier League WL requirement, many will be looking to sell their high end Premier League cards. This could prove to be a great time to pick them up in anticipation of an organic rebound later in the year. The same goes for Liga Santander and Bundesliga players should they come out with another batch of requirements for the week after the 24th. 
Ratings Refresh
As we mentioned in the recap section, the prices of many of the popular upgrade candidates have already risen in anticipation of their ratings increase. However, if you look hard enough there are a number of special cards in other leagues that have remained low because many are hesitant to invest for fear that their upgrade won’t reach their first inform. However, as we’ve seen with the likes of Mane and Kante, EA are willing to make exceptions this year. I don’t want to name any specific players for fear of ruining the investment(s), but they are out there. 
In general, I would stay away from the more popular candidates. Many have been reinvigorated by the hype of the Ratings Refresh, especially the popular upgrade candidates. This was clear with someone like the now 92 rated ST Hazard. Despite the rating upgrade from 91 to 92, his price has hardly moved. 
With that in mind, this week is going to be a great week for flipping/trading. As people come to realize that certain cards will not get a large enough upgrade or don’t get an upgrade at all, they will panic sell. If you think a card has solid long term potential, it could be a great time to pick them up if that panic selling leads to a dip in their price. This is especially true for Premier League players who will have unusually low demand by the end of the weekend. For example, someone like Lukaku, who many thought would get an upgrade, has taket a hit since the announcement. This has caused many people to panic sell. 
They are also releasing downgrade cards. It might be worth picking up the regular gold cards of those players before their downgraded versions permanently go into packs (@GummiFIFA has compiled a number of potential downgrade candidates based on rating changes from career mode and head to head on his twitter). As an example, someone like Smalling could receive a downgrade. Given his popularity, his 84 version could come under pressure if it goes out of packs, forcing it to rise in price. Before doing this, however, make sure that you are investing in a card that is in high demand in competitive gameplay or people won’t bother shelling out the extra coins for a higher rated version. 
Another note is that if you manage to pack an upgraded gold card, sell them on as early as you can. Many of the stat boosts have not been that significant and despite this many of the gold cards are overpriced considering how minimal their stats have been raised. An example of this is the upgraded Kante who was trading at 60k earlier on Xbox. 
League SBC investing
There are a number of League SBCs that have yet to drop including but not limited to; the Premier League, Calcio A, Bundesliga, etc.
For those of you that don’t know, in order to complete the league SBCs, you essentially need to turn in full teams for each team in the league to get the reward at the end (which often includes a large sum of coins and a special card).
With this in mind, there are a number of players on different teams (especially in the lesser known leagues) that only have one player in the game for certain positions. When the league SBCs drop, the demand for these players will be focused on them because they are the only option that can be used to complete the squad.
Ideally, you will want to identify these players and invest in them before the league SBC drops. The best type of player to invest in would be silver players who are the only option in their position. The relative rarity of silver players generally causes them to go extinct whereas gold players will rise but often not to extinction.
TOTW 22 Investments
From the looks of things, we are going to get a solid number of promo packs this week to celebrate the upgrades. Hopefully, this will push the prices of this week’s informs down to attractive investing prices. Let’s talk about a few to keep your eye on;
Martial: This is an obvious one. In my opinion, he’s currently overpriced/overhyped, but if he drops after this weekend when people are selling their premier league teams, he could fall to an attractive price. 
Marquinhos: What a card this guy has! Given his high pace and equally impressive defensive stats, he has decent long term potential. He is particularly interesting because of the potential for EA to do a Ligue 1/Calcio A WL requirement in the future. 
Carrasco: I’ve been told that this card is incredible in game. He could make a competitive replacement for the likes of Neymar and CR7 on the left in the Liga Santander. Plus, he could link with any of the high powered informs the Belgians have been racking up this year."

""Who the f--- is Sean McAllister?""
When FIFA Mobile first launched their ""Golden Egg"" promo and we slowly but surely began to see user picks filter in to the game database, that had to be a common refrain each and every time a new player discovered him.
One of the more (if not most) surprising selections from all the Golden Eggs was 58-overall Grimsby Town center midfielder Sean McAllister. A bit of a journeyman known primarily for his vision, the one time Manchester United youth player's floated around at the senior level between Sheffield Wednesday and primarily League Two sides. But FIFA Mobile player 'jmacdaddy02', perhaps a Grimsby backer (efforts to get in touch with him for this piece were unsuccessful, unfortunately), elected to use his Golden Egg to make him one of the dozen or so highest rated player in this inaugural season of FIFA Mobile.
While choosing a bronze player is a savvy Golden Egg building strategy -- think of the pace on Jordan Morris' 99-overall -- McAllister's base stats are pretty far from anything special. The +41 boost across the item still however makes for a worthwhile elite center midfielder. And if you wind up taking advantage of the indefinite promo in-game to build a Golden Egg player with eight Golden Egg tokens, there are far worse choices than the League Two dynamo.
Let's start by looking at his stats:

The real-life McAllister is heralded for his passing, and this FM iteration of him delivers in spades. 108 short passing is tied for second best in the game with only End of an Era Xabi Alonso and cTOTW Naby Keïta equaling or besting it.
His stamina is also an otherwordly base rating of 123. Two versions of N'Golo Kanté, his FM TOTS and Ultimate Team of the Season versions, are the only two with superior ratings there.
So how did he do in-game? For this review, I played what I considered a ""normal day's load"" of FM to try and get a sense for what he brought to the table. That included Two Live Events (the End of an Era one vs LA Galaxy and the Blue-Star one against Chelsea), two matches in the Futhead League Championship, and five games of Vs Attack. Here was how he fared:
Stats
Games: 9
Goals: 11
Assists: Roughly 4
Not too shabby for a central non-primary attacking player. But how did he handle?
Review
The downsides to McAllister are few and far between. The most obvious and lingering (and one that goes into post-review sample turns using the item) was McAllister's poor ability to put headers on goal. With corner kicks easier than ever in the latest gameplay revision, leveraging the likes of Player of the Month Luka Modric or Kanté for gimme goals has become a staple of VsA and league matches alike. But even with a 95 heading rating, McAllister almost always feels like a liability in those kind of situations.
The real life footballer is but 173 cm (5'8"") tall. That's around the only thing I've been able to come up with as to why when a perfectly tapped corner goes right to him, he merely knocks the ball down and contemplates the finer things in life instead of attempting to redirect it towards the goal.
As far as I'm aware, ""Weak Feet"" aren't an impactful FIFA Mobile thing beyond which foot is the stronger and which is the less so. But McAllister has a three-star one on console, and 99-Golden Egg McAllister felt every bit one of them. In one such instance, playing centrally in a 3-4-2-1, McAllister had a clear open view of the goal. But by leveraging his left foot instead of his stronger right, the ball skewed past the post out of play to reset the turn. A few other times McAllister's left seemed to electively pursue challenging portions of the goal but just never quite be able to seal the deal.
The last, and it's tough to say what really caused this issue, was that McAllister, for whatever reason, wasn't as effective in a four-back set. Whether playing with a 4-3-2-1 or a 4-3-3, McAllister would disappear for large stretches of a time. By comparison, POTM Modric and uTOTS Kante seemed to get at least one or two possesion per contest while McAllister would be lucky to get any kind of touch during the 45'. These problems may have been rectified by experimenting between all three CM spots, but trying both the left and right-sided ones seemed to mirror the issue. There were no such troubles playing him in three-back formations, however.
Those relative shortcomings aside, it's a stretch (outside the most absolute nitpicky manners possible) to find any real fault in the item.
He wasn't uTOTS Kanté fast, but he had all the pace you could ever need for an elite high-end CM in-game. If McAllister was in the clear, he was either getting a shot on goal or dumping the ball off to a trailing teammate to finish the delivery.
It wasn't just the pace; McAllister felt good and fast. When you're driving a luxury car, you expect a certain luxury feel. Golden Egg McAllister succeeds in living up to those expectations. His mix of acceleration and high end speed more than sufficed and left you feeling satisfied with his (admittedly steep) price tag.
Something else that seemed tough to peg through metrics alone was his marksmanship. What I mean by that is when presented with challenging angles or harder, longer (though not quite long) shot opportunities, McAllister would rear back, take aim, and almost always hit the mark. His shooting stats are more than fine -- 90 positioning, 86 finishing, 91 shot power -- but he played at a much, much higher level regardless of who else was with him in the lineup. 
Sort of in the way Legends in FIFA on console almost do things or feel a certain way that makes you wonder if there aren't some intangible boosts making them play better than the listed numbers, McAllister often did as well.
And last but surely not least, the passing. The real life McAllister is well regarded for his ability to identify and find his teammates, and the Golden Egg FIFA Mobile edition more than lives up to the billing. Whether on the go, from the perimeter, or in a de-facto No. 10 like situation, there were little-to-no concerns with a pass not going where it was supposed to and a completion percentage to match those lofty ambitions. With 108 short-passing, would you really expect any thing less?
Summary
If you were to give me one challenge regarding this FM item, it would be weighing it against the Golden Egg Jordan Morris I've also been fortunate enough to have tried. His impact and influence on the game is so high, particularly given how often strikers start with or finish a turn with an attempt on net. Gun to my head, I'm defaulting to the attacker and ever so slightly preferring Morris. But if you need a CM to round out your luxury-good-laden FIFA Mobile team, you could do far, far worse than 99-overall Sean McAllister.
McAllister might not be the best CM in the game, which with you requiring somewhere around three or four bundles to build him you might expect. But having tried uTOTS Kanté, POTM Modric, AM Master Vidal, and all the Team of the Year CMs, I'm hard pressed to say he's not one of the top two or three.
If you've got the disposable income to invest in the game, it's difficult to imagine McAllister disappointing you on the pitch.
Rating: 9.5/10

There are many big events to be found across FIFA’s calendar year: you've got Team of the Season, Team of the Year, and the now weekly trials and tribulations of FUT Champions too. However, there’s something else. Something bigger. That doesn't always land on the same day, but when it does it riles the FIFA community like nothing else. The first post launch patch (dun, dun, duuuuun!!!)
Which, just for reference this time around, modified the following within FIFA 18’s gameplay:
•   Tuned goalkeeper reactions in certain situations.
•   Tuned down the difficulty for Amateur and Semi-Pro difficulties.
•   Reduced shot accuracy and slightly increased goalkeeper reaction times in certain in-game situations.
All-in-all that's a pretty innocuous list of gameplay changes on the surface, all of which have had enough community 'noise' behind them to make you think “yeah, nice one EA” but as that patch installed around the world, the reaction was as predictable as my pack luck: 

Day One patches are nothing new in video games of course. But when it comes to FIFA, their ability to shift the perception of an entire game is almost unrivaled. That’s no surprise I guess given that FIFA’s core experience revolves around repetition of virtual football matches. Whether you’re in Career Mode, Squad Battles or just playing 1v1 with your mates, each of those differing FIFA modes relies on the consistency of the gameplay fundamentals. The teams and score may change, but the underlying framework does not. 

If you’re playing ""Uncharted"" and one of the levels is a bit rubbish, or the pacing is off, you can always rely on the next one to be a cathedral collapsing, henchmen strangling, tank outrunning riot. But not so with FIFA. If there’s an issue with player positioning, or long shots are finding the net far too routinely, it affects everything. And that’s why these launch patches can cut the games community perception so deep. 
Part of the problem, for me, lies in how EA choose to apply the early feedback they receive. Because at the start of every FIFA, hordes of people swarm the servers playing countless matches and in no more than a heartbeat, the first big issue surfaces. That initial source can come from influencers, the forums, Reddit, or social media; it doesn’t really matter. But once that first ""issue"" seed is sown, the popular narrative bandwagon quickly builds to a fever of “FIX YOUR GAME, EA.” 
Sometimes the issues identified are genuine. But more often than not they’re actually based on opinion, rather than fact. And that opinion in the context of an entire FIFA cycle, is coming from a place of mostly inexperience with the latest content. Whether people believe FIFA 18 to be ""FIFA 17.5"" or whatever you want to call it, that .5 can still contain thousands of code changes, making any kind of informed opinion about what’s good or bad, incredibly difficult to offer up reliably even after an initial sprint of matches.
However, no matter how many times people are advised to “be patient” or to ""wait and adjust"" these snap judgements are unavoidable. So at that point the focus must shift to EA and how they manage this type of feedback internally, particularly the parts relating to gameplay. If something is genuinely broken within a mode, or a menu then EA should fix it right away, no questions asked. But when it comes to gameplay, I personally think EA need to proceed with great caution because once that patch lands, there's just about no going back. 
And for me, in the last two or three years, I'm concerned EA have been way too quick to patch that initial ourpour of opinion. From this year's reaction (and last's), it's clearly beginning to grate on those who were probably quite enjoying themselves before FIFA 18's gameplay was altered to suit feedback they never offered up themselves. 
Community feedback is important; imperative, in fact, to game health. But at the end of the day only EA are in charge of FIFA 18’s creative vision and no one else. That position shouldn’t ever be taken for granted or used as a form of superiority. But they are the people that make the game after all. Developers these days are often heralded for ""listening"" to their communties. But listening doesn't have to always mean acting. Sometimes it's ok for community and developer to stop and let things simmer before taking action. If the early feedback doesn't hold up against EA's own vision for the game, then to a degree, maybe we need to trust that they are right to hold the line. 
Because make no mistake, the strides FIFA has taken on the pitch and away from it has been nothing short of spectacular over the last five years. We now have modes we’d never even dreamed of playing. And yet for some reason, after all that success EA seems to sometimes still seem to lack confidence in the quality of their on-pitch performance year to year.
In the run up to launch, EA host countless playtests, gaming shows, betas and demos as a chance to garner that early feedback and apply it to the game before it ships. But after that, the feedback process should go into listen only mode. At least for the first month, so that everyone has the required time to adjust their own playstyle and to really think about what they would like to be changed.
And even then, the team at EA should be well within their rights to openly say “actually guys, we don’t think you’re wrong about this, and here’s why”. Right now, the maturity of the conversation between community and developer feels light years away from that kind of candid interaction, but if mind-sets on both sides were to shift just a little bit, I think we could eventually get there.
As Henry Ford (allegedly) once said as he embarked on the mass production of motor vehicles… “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”
And as a community I think that quote is something we all need to think closely about when it comes to providing feedback -- especially in the opening weeks -- and vice versa for EA themselves as the ‘manufacturer’ of the title. Sometimes we don’t know what we want until EA give it to us. But at the very least, we should also be given the time to try out their vision before it changes too soon."

In years past, the FIFA Ultimate Team calendar has had several major milestones throughout the year and one of the biggest was the release of EA's Team of the Year. The first majorly upgraded player items have dropped around the beginning of the New Year coinciding with the announcement of the FIFPro World XI. 
However, FIFA is now throwing a major wrench into our normal way of FUT life. Instead of holding their awards gala called ""The Best FIFA Football Awards"" in January, they've moved the event up all the way to October, just two months into the European seasons. This obviously creates quite the conundrum for EA. 
The awards ceremony takes place next week, October 23. Would EA want to introduce a high profile release such as Team of the Year so early in this game's cycle? What would that even do to the FUT market? What would be the alternatives if they decided not to do a usual TOTY release?
Adding to the drama was a purported ""leak"" on the German FIFA Ultimate Team Facebook page:

That translates to the following (H/T Futhead's krewnaj):

Simon Bratko: Does TOTY actually come out in the next few days or later? Allegedly on October 23rd? Do you have any further info? A lot of theories but nobody seems to know
Oliver Ruh: Did it always drop so early? Doesn’t it drop in December or January?
EA SPORTS FIFA Ultimate Team (deutsch): Hi Simon, that is right, TOTY will come on Oct 23rd! Have fun with FIFA 18! Kind regards, Niko
Simon Bratko: So we can pull the first TOTY players from packs on Oct 23rd? Did I get that right? And is that 100% confirmed?
EA SPORTS FIFA Ultimate Team (deutsch): Hi Oliver, that is the pre release. The final release will be on October 27th.

The page was quick to backtrack though, with the person that had posted them saying the aforementioned were merely ""personal guesses"" rather than anything official:

The repeated apology translates to:

""Hey Simon, that was a personal guess. Exact release dates can be found in posts on the official EA site.""

It's important to take perceived ""leaks"" like these with massive grains of salt. While more credible than the contractors who man EA's support channels, not every individual with access to branded social media accounts like these would even be in position to get or receive privileged, embargoed (e.g. unreleased) information like this. If anything, that adds credence to the explanation that it was just a ""personal guess"" through an inappropriate avenue.
Also, for what it's worth, we'd heard whispers several weeks back indicating we shouldn't expect TOTY in October around the time of FIFA's ""The Best"" Awards. But you're well familiar with the hashtag at this point: #ExpectTheUnexpected.
So, what are EA's options here?
World XI SBCs
One solution could be to turn it into a special month-long (or longer) event where Squad Building Challenges are released periodically with the 11 FIFA ""World XI"" players as the prizes. If this were the case, they may not necessarily even have to be the high end-game type items they've been in the past, too. More Player of the Month or TOTS type boosts could be in order -- and at a steep cost, undoubtedly. These could even live in conjunction with an EA decided TOTY with the more traditional OP boosts to be released in January as per usual.
Even sans TOTY type ratings though, doing them all at once would probably still be overkill. Perhaps releasing these by position would be more realistic. Again though, you run into the problem of the game being so early in its cycle and users not having the coin base to compete for the high-end players. The fairness of players being inserted into packs is the randomness that someone with few coins can pack them.
Another option would be to create a new type of item similar to Ones to Watch items where the cards start off at a normal rating and increase through the year via real life performances, accomplishments, or special items nods. It may be a bit of a stretch to add another dynamic item type, but it would hypothetically solve the problem of inserting over-powered cards into the market at such an early stage of the game. 
Keep TOTY in January
The most likely solution -- and what we would bet to happen -- would be for EA to do absolutely nothing different and just wait until their normal TOTY schedule to release the special black-and-blue player items. It would avoid any major shakeups in the FUT economy and keep the calendar on an even keel. 
Think about it. If there's nothing after FUTmas ends in December, you have a large gap between special events. TOTY is a vital part of the FUT calendar that keeps the game fresh and exciting in a dull part of the year. 
Instead of relying on the FIFPro World XI, create your own TOTY. Perhaps even involve the community and use polls to help determine your best XI. I'm sure FIFA won't be heartbroken if you change it up a bit to keep the stability of your best game mode intact. 
Conclusion
Regardless of what happens, there's no doubt that this year's FUT calendar will look a little different thanks to the FIFA awards changing. It's quite the dilemma for EA to deal with and it could have big consequences for the community depending on what they decide. What would you like to see happen? Let us know in the comments below."

                        Just as you thought the sides couldn't get any better ...
                    

Last week’s score: 15/23
Formation: 3-4-1-2: Squad link: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/4865384/

Goalkeeper
Geronimo Rulli - GK - OVR 83
The Sociedad stopper has started the season well and was rewarded in terms of FUT with an upgrade. That upgrade could be about to get even bigger with Rulli in line for an IF item after making a total of six saves in their 1-0 win. Rulli picked up 3's from Marca along with the MOTM award.
Defenders
Ezequiel Garay - CB - OVR 84
One of the surprise results of the week came on Thursday night when Valencia shocked Real Madrid with a 2-1 win, a result which meant that Madrid have lost more games in 2017 than they had during the whole of 2016. As for the IF it is a difficult one to predict but with Garay picking up 3 from Marca and being 84 rated it makes the Argentine a realistic shout.
Alex Sandro - LB - OVR 84
Sandro has been snubbed on numerous occasions so far and is far from a certainty once again this week. He does have yet another shout though after scoring one of two Juventus goals in a 2-0 win at home to Empoli. 
Patrick Van Aanholt - LB - OVR 75
PVA was one of the few players to impress for Sunderland, largely due to his attacking presence rather than his defensive ability. The Dutch defender continued his offensive form with another goal to his name, this time for Palace, as they went on to win 1-0 over Middlesbrough. With the additional incentive of an OTW item I can't see him missing out this time.
Midfielders
Memphis Depay - LM - OVR 80
Depay just didn't cut it for English football and although it is early days in terms of his Lyon career he has already outperformed what he managed for United. Another two goals to his name this week during Lyon's 5-0 home win saw him pick up MOTM with an 8/10 an inevitable IF on the way.
Marco Verratti - CM - OVR 85
PSG recorded an impressive 5-1 win over their rivals Marseille this week and although it was more of a team performance the likelihood is that they will still be picking up an IF. Verratti was the official MOTM with an 8/10 from L'equipe and thus it’s hard to look anywhere else.
Radja Nainggolan - CAM - OVR 85
We always knew that Nainggolan was good but he really has outperformed his expectations this season and another superb performance this week against Inter puts him in line for an 88 rated item. The Belgian, whose position is up for debate, scored both the first and second Roma goals in their 3-1 away win over Inter Milan.
Cesc Fabregas - CM - OVR 86
The first of two players I have selected of whom has recently received a MOTM item is Fabregas, no prizes for guessing the second. The Spaniard got both a goal and an assist for Chelsea in a 3-1 win over Swansea as he celebrated his 300th BPL appearance.
Thomas Muller - CAM - OVR 87
    For me this spot is between both Muller and Coman, both of whom received the highest mark available from Kicker but seeing as Muller played the whole game while Coman came on when the game was already over I have opted for the German this time around. Muller claimed three assists in a huge 8-0 victory.
Forwards
Robert Lewandowski - ST - OVR 90
Munich went on a rampage to say the least, putting eight, yes eight, past Hamburg without a reply. Lewandowski was the stand out performer scoring three of those goals but the likelihood is that we will be seeing more than one Munich player included. Lewandowski is the certainty though.
Harry Kane - ST - OVR 85
Despite Harry Kane recently picking up a MOTM item I do not believe that will have any impact on his potential FIF. The striker can't stop scoring and made it three hat tricks in just seven games which is a crazy statistic for anyone. It was at Stoke on the receiving end this time as they fell to a 4-0 defeat. 
Substitutes
Ruud Vormer - RB - OVR 77
There is a slight debate over the actual position of Vormer but seeing as he is listed as a RB on the team sheet that is the position I shall be using. The Dutchman scored twice during Brugge's impressive 5-0 win over third placed Zulte, claiming MOTM in the process.
Jens Toornstra - CM - OVR 76
Feyenoord made it 10 consecutive wins with a 2-1 win over fellow title contenders PSV. Toornstra picked up MOTM after his opener with a huge match rating of 8.5, something I have only seen a couple of times previously in Holland. 
Valter Birsa - CAM - OVR 78
Recently we have seen a few players, even outside of the top leagues pick up IF's for good performances and in a sense that should be the case. Birsa was brilliant for Chievo in their 2-0 win over Pescara and although he only scored the one goal on paper after an 8 from Gazzetta he really should be in with a shout.
Ozer Hurmaci - LM - OVR 75
The fact that Hurmaci is a gold item helps his chances significantly for me but with two goals to his name he does have a shout to make the final cut. Belediyespor ending up winning the match by a comfortable 3-0 score line and Ozer, who played out on the left picked up MOTM in the process.
Adrian Gonzalez - CAM - OVR 75
Eibar have been very impressive as of late and they continued that good form with a comfortable 3-0 win of which Gonzalez scored two. The Spaniard picked up a perfect 3 from Marca and thus should be able to make a bench spot.
Idrissa Gueye - CM - OVR 82
This one can be classed as a bit of a punt but with the lack of clear BPL options there is a shout for the Everton midfielder. Gueye who has been superb this season scored one of two Everton goals in their 2-0 win, claiming MOTM in the process.
Jamie Vardy - ST - OVR 82
It was the sacking of Ranieri which took the world by storm this week but back in footballing terms it was a successful week for Leicester as they shocked Livepool, beating them 3-1. Vardy scored two of the three and with the lack of gold striker options he could well be included despite being a Monday match.
Reserves
Connor Ripley - GK - OVR 63
We have seen an ever-growing trend of two gold keepers making the cut recently however you really can't ignore what Ripley managed to do on Saturday. The Oldham stopper saved two late penalties to help secure a point with a 0-0 draw against Millwall.
Mattia Caldara - CB - OVR 74
Potentially the best performance of the week came from Atalanta's CB Caldara. The 22-year-old defender helped guide his side to a shock 2-0 away win over Napoli, scoring both goals and helping secure a clean sheet while only playing with 10 men for the final 25. His performance saw him claim a huge 9/10 from Gazzetta which is something you don’t see often.
Jota - RW - OVR 73
Jota has impressed since signing for Brentford, chipping in with multiple offensive contributions. I personally believe he could go to the next level but while in the Championship he continues to improve. The winger found himself with three goals to his name during their 4-2 win over Brentford.
Jakub Sylvestr - ST - OVR 69
I think it’s safe to say that Sylvestri flopped while playing his football in Germany without many disagreeing but Aalborg won't be complaining after he scored all three of their goals during a 3-0 home win over Silkeborg
Conor McAleny - ST - OVR 65
Everton have a bunch of youngsters coming through, many making first team appearances while others are out on loan. McAleny is the latter and arguably is running out of time to impress. The striker who is now playing at Oxford impressed on Saturday, scoring three of their four goals in a 4-0 away win."

With the recent improvements that are came to FIFA Mobile in the 6.2 version, a few more tweaks have been made, and are being unrolled in version 6.2.1, which was announced earlier today on the EA forums.
Unlike the previous update, this one focuses on fixing some of the smaller bugs which have been noticed in recent days, such as:

The auto-play setting has been reset to ""on"" for all users because the default was incorrect. - You can adjust this in the Settings Menu
Great Chances should generally occur earlier in the match
Re-balanced Possession chance distribution to decrease OVR impact at smaller deltas
The match summary now shows the correct number of chances
""Countered"" is no longer displayed when you aren't actually countered in League and VS Attack matches
Fixed a crash when accessing your League

Made chip and volley shots great again.

Hopefully this update should fix many of the annoyances which you may have been facing, such as being unable to make the most of your great chances because of when they occur, or help you have a better chance at improving your Versus Attack Mode rank by trying to prevent you facing some people with much higher rated squads.
Let us know your thoughts on these changes, as well as any other bugs which you have noticed which can hopefully be fixed in the near future."

After matchmaking issues plagued a number of users throughout the course of Friday, the FIFA production team made the wise (and to be honest, fair) decision to extend FUT 18's Weekend League by one day for the weekend of October 13, originally scheduled to end just after October 16, now wrapping up early October 17. This Weekend League ends Tuesday morning at 2 a.m. ET (6 a.m. BST), a full 24 hours later than is customary.
Though many would likely welcome such a shift permanently, any who had connectivity problems or technical difficulties finding opponents (and heck, as well everyone who just plain procrastinated or spent Friday doing SBCs or what not) will now get the extra time to have a much better chance at getting in your 40 games.
As a result of the shift, this coming week's Daily Knockout Tournament will start 24 hours later than ordinary and be one day shorter than normal, beginning in earnest Tuesday, October 17 for most in Western Europe and the United States.
Those who logged into their next gen consoles late Friday/early Saturday were greeted with an in-game message -- as we've grown accustomed to lately -- that looks like the one at the top of this post explaining the reasoning behind the decision. We'll have to see if a well received (though necessary in this instance) extension will lead to any future scheduling changes for the competitive event."

This week's Marquee Transfers are a little understated. Sure, if you're a diehard Chelsea FC, West Ham, Spain, or Mexico fan, you have to be thrilled. For the rest of us? Eh. It's so-so. But it's July. And we're a few weeks from Gamescom. I suppose we'll take whatever we can get.
Though Alvaro Morata and Javier ""Chicharito"" Hernandez are fun in their own right, today's FIFA 17 Ultimate Team releases that really get the blood pumping come in the form of the new-old Best of Squad Building Challenges.
If you missed Throwback Fernando Torres -- which although I didn't personally care for, many YouTubers and pros swear by -- you've got your chance. Marcus Rashford's best FUT 17 card is back in play for those players new to the game or who missed it the first time around. And in really cool news, the Year of the Rooster SBC is back -- and offering a free TOTS player. Hype!
If you complete any of the SBCs and get anything good, let us know in the comments below."

                        In years past, the weeks following the TOTY were a bit stale in terms of FUT content. This past week certainly hasn’t fit that mold, and it appears that the next couple weeks will be full of promotions that will keep traders and investors on their toes. Let’s take a look back at what the past week has brought us and recap how it affected the market. Then we’ll talk about the promotions we can look forward this coming week and how we can makes coins off of them.
                    

The week started poorly. While EA managed to patch the no loss glitch, the disconnect glitch was still affecting many players, even in FUT Champs. In addition, the coin farming glitch appears to still be earning coin sellers hundreds of thousands of coins per week (an impossible feat given the limit of 75 games per day) as the graphic below can attest to. As coin prices fell and the market was flooded with freshly farmed coins, the prices of high demand, end-game cards (Ex. CR7, Messi, Legends) rose steadily early in the week.

Then, EA managed to balance out the market and even cause a mini crash with the Lunar New Year promotion. The promotion saw the release of a Lunar New Year SBC as well as half price coin packs. These discounted coin packs were significant because they took coins (equivalent to buying power/demand) off of the market and dramatically increased supply. In fact, transfer volume on Xbox reached TOTY levels, with a whopping 2.3 million active transfers (see below)! This combo was the one-two punch the market needed to normalize again. In fact, the prices of virtually everything took a heavy hit, with Legends, high end TOTWs,  and low rated/high demand golds dropping the most. In addition, popular investment picks from TOTW 19 hit ridiculously low prices with the likes of SIF Coleman hitting 80k on Xbox.

While there was a bit of disappointment in the investing/trading community in the lack of Lunar New Year SBCs, they were quickly remedied by a Sky Sports tweet that suggested there would be a new batch of OTW cards dropping on the 3rd of February accompanied with what appeared to be a guaranteed OTW SBC. Below are two of the images that Sky tweeted. We’ll talk about the details of this upcoming release and how to make coins off of it in the next couple sections. 

Shortly after Lunar New Year, the market managed to recover a bit, but then EA hit us with a hefty batch of FA Cup MOTM cards to accompany TOTW 20 on Wednesday. While the TOTW was largely unimpressive (especially in terms of investments), the batch of MOTM cards included a number of incredibly good looking cards, including a Son, Walcott, and Toure. As a result of this release, the market took a heavy, albeit temporary, hit. This dip happened for two reasons. The first was that the likes of Son, Walcott, and Toure effectively split the demand for many high end BPL players. The second was that many wanted to liquidate parts of their clubs to try out these cards as well as get a chance to snipe MOTM Son who was extinct at 300k. Those who were quick enough to snipe him are now hoping that EA raise his price cap so they can sell for a profit. This combo pushed down the prices of high end Premier League strikers, central players, and RWs as well as TOTW 19 investments. However, like most panic sells, prices normalized after ~10 hours. 
In other news, as expected, many of the popular winter upgrade investment picks (Ex. TIF Mertens) continued their steady decline as we descend down the peak of the YouTube induced investing hype. In addition, many of the League SBCs, including the Lacazette SBC, hit record lows. Finally, we saw the release of two more batches of iMOTM cards, the most notable of which was an 87 rated Salah. 
FUT - The Week Ahead
As we look to the week ahead, we’ll focus our attention on four major events; the first batch of winter upgrades, the new set of OTW cards and the accompanying SBC, the AFCON TOTT and SBC, and POTM hype. 
First Batch of Winter Upgrades
If EA decide to follow the timing of years past, they will be dropping their first round of winter upgrades on February 3rd. However, given the sheer volume of content coming out that day, I would guess that EA might postpone the upgrades until next week. Irrelevant of when they release the first round, we can confidently guess that there will be multiple batches of upgrades. It is predicted that they will do four rounds.
In past updates, we pointed out that the prices of many of the popular IF upgrade investment picks (The two squads below contain many of the popular picks) already had their upgrade potential and then some baked into their price because of the hype they received from various influencers in the community. We’ve already seen them start to fall and I anticipate that we’ll see them continue to fall. It is possible that many will fall below their inherent value if investors begin to panic sell, presenting a coin making opportunity. We’ll talk about that in the coin making section. 

New Batch of OTW Cards/OTW SBC
As discussed earlier, Sky Sports spilled the beans about a new batch of OTW cards and what appears to be a OTW SBC. The promotion is set to start Friday, February 3rd and will run until the 10th. We are not sure when the accompanying SBC will drop but I suspect it will be on the 3rd as well. 
Unfortunately, unlike the first batch of OTW items, there were no real blockbuster deals this transfer window in terms of cards that would be valuable in FUT (Below are a number of candidates for this new release). Keep in mind that in order to be considered the player must be under the age the 30 (Payet just makes it at 29).
The most pressing issue for many investors here is guessing the requirements/rewards for the SBC Sky Sports mentioned SBC. There has just been an update to the source code that detailed a number of new SBCs and many of them seem to be related to the OTW promotion (see below). I’ll leave a link to the source code at the end of the article.

These will likely be blockbuster SBCs if they do in fact drop, and it’s looking very likely that they will. The big news here is the tradable and untradeable SBCs for the summer OTW cards. That would mean the likes of OTW Pogba, Kante, and Dembele would go back onto the market!
In terms of requirements, I think it’s fair to assume that they would make it similar to the TOTW SBCs, but a good deal harder. My guess at the requirements would be a minimum overall of 85+ for the untradeable and 86+ for the tradeable SBC, a requirement to turn in 1-2 special cards (could be TOTW, MOTM, iMOTM, TOTGS… who knows), and a moderately high team chemistry (it’s usually 80). 
Many people believe that a OTW item will be required for the SBC. Without getting into too much detail as to why, I don’t think EA will do this because it defeats the purpose of having those OTW items in the game. It ruins the connection that EA and its league sponsors are trying to build between players and teams if the OTW items become incredibly rare after people turn them in for the SBCs. We’ll talk about how we can makes coin off of this SBC and new batch of OTW cards in the coin making section.
African Cup of Nation Team of the Tournament (TOTT) and SBC
The African Cup of Nations is set to come to an end on Sunday, February 5th. In years past, EA has released TOTT’s for the AFCON and it looks like they will do the same again this year. If they do so, I would think that the team would drop on either the 5th or the 8th.
We also saw in the updated source code a guaranteed TOTT SBC! The requirements for such a SBC could include players from African nations, MOTM/iMOTM cards, and a relatively high minimum team rating/team chemistry. 
When it drops, the likes of Salah and Mahrez could get another set of special cards which would devalue their iMOTM cards significantly. If you have them in your club, it might be worth shifting them on if you are not willing to take the gamble.

POTM Voting/Hype
Voting for POTM has just recently dropped. As can been seen below, the candidates are Alli, Coleman, Kane, Sanchez, and Sigurdsson. 


It’s looking like the front runners are Alli and Kane, but it’s likely that Sanchez will win the popular vote because many FIFA fans will want to see that card in game. That being said, it is important to remember that the popular vote only counts for 10% of the decision. The other 90% is decided by a panel. We’ll talk about investing for this POTM SBC below.

Making Coins this Week
Given the number of events coming up, it looks like there are going to be several great ways to make coins this week. In this section we’ll cover the remaining opportunities to make coins off of winter upgrades, the OTW SBC, how to invest in the OTW cards, this week’s TOTW/MOTM investments, the African Cup of Nations TOTT SBC, and league SBC investing. But first, we’ll start with a bit of guidance about what you can expect overall from the market. 
Overall Market Analysis - General Advice
The way things are shaping up, it appears that there are going to be plenty of reasons to open packs this weekend, along with the release of a decent number of demand splitting cards. That is a recipe for a solid dip in the prices of high priced cards. If you have past investments that you are holding onto and that you can sell for a profit now, it might be a decent idea to shift those on. At the same time, the SBCs should push up the prices of low priced/high rated golds, IFs, and any cards that are cornered by the OTW/TOTT SBC requirements. 
Because of the amount of coin making opportunities and the headwinds that some investments will face, the safest option would be to roll into this weekend with the majority of your club value in coins. 
That being said, I am in no way suggesting that you panic sell all the cards in your club, especially if it would mean selling a team that you use in FUT Champs. Unless you intend to spend the weekend sniping and trading, it’s not worth it. I anticipate that this dip will be a relatively temporary, with the worst of it coming if and when the TOTT drops (similar to what happened with the MOTM release). 
Winter Upgrades
At this point, the window for the investing in the informs with upgrade potential has long passed. In fact, if you are still holding on to any, I would sell them on before the actual upgrades drop. However, that doesn’t mean that the opportunities to make coins on winter upgrades has passed. Here are a number of ways you could still do it;

After the first batch of upgrades is announced, any informs that didn’t get upgraded in the first batch may suffer from a bit of panic selling. This could lead to people listing the cards below their value regardless of winter upgrade potential. If it is announced that a player received an upgrade, but the upgrade is not large enough to change the rating of their IF, then there is a good chance that heavy panic selling will follow. Someone like Kante (who will likely not get the upgrade to an 84 required to affect his IF) could drop below his long-term value because of panic selling.
There will be opportunities to make coins off the gold cards
When the upgraded cards are put into packs, many people don't realize that they have packed an upgraded card and will list it at the price of the non-upgraded version. This will provide ample sniping opportunities.
One the flip side of this, many people will panic sell their gold cards when they find out they received an upgrade. However, the price difference over time, usually isn’t that large, especially for the higher rated cards. This means that there will be opportunities to pick up these cards on snipes as well as chances to turn around and list them for lazy buyers.




Investing in OTW cards
Even though I still think that many of the OTW items are ridiculously overpriced, the market doesn’t care what I think, and the market says that these OTW items are decent long term investments. 
There are a couple of things to remember if you are thinking about investing in these new OTW items. The first is that you’ll want to invest in a player who is going to see regular playing time as well as have the chance to score/grab assists frequently. This is much easier to do if they are on a team that dominates their league and if they are an attacking player. These are the cards that are the most likely going to get IFs, which in turn, will upgrade their OTW. 
Also remember that the timeframe that many of these players have to get IFs is shorter than it was for the first batch of OTW cards. Therefore, be weary of using comparative pricing to settle on price points. In addition, do your best to pick up fresh cards (zero games played for other clubs). High end cards like OTW cards can be much more valuable later down the line if they are fresh.
In addition, when the summer OTW SBCs drop and the likes of OTW Pogba, Kante, and Dembele come back onto the market, their card prices will likely fall hard. In fact, they’ve already begun to fall with many panic selling in anticipation of the their price dropping. Picking up fresh summer OTW items during a panic sell looks like a great long term move if you have the coins.
Prepping for OTW SBC
From the looks of things, this is the big SBC(s) that a lot of us traders and investors have been waiting for. As we noted above, there will likely be winter/summer OTW SBCs that are tradeable/untradeable. These are going to be very expensive SBCs and will likely push the prices of any cornered requirements through the roof.

Based on the requirements that we predicted earlier, it is a good idea to stock up on 85+ cards, with an emphasis on cheap 85 rated cards (if you haven’t already) and high rated/low priced IFs with good leagues and nationalities. Like always, the best technique here is to get one copy of each (so that you can just store them in your club) and then buy a couple more of the ones that you are confident about. You can also pick up/hold any discard special cards such as scream cards, TOTGS, or Movember cards because they might be needed as a curveball requirement.
Personally, I would stay away from current OTW cards. I doubt that they will be a requirement for the SBC (I’ve explained my reasoning on this in past posts). That being said, if you have low priced OTW cards that you picked up for cheap, I would keep them in case they are a requirement. If you haven’t bought them already, I would stay away, many of their prices have already risen substantially.
The safest bet when investing, is to cross invest in POTM by investing in high rated/low priced gold cards and IFs that also have the potential to be used in the POTM SBC. 
POTM Investing
As was mentioned earlier the front runners for the January POTM are Dele Alli and Kane. Investing in this POTM SBC should probably fall on the backburner for now with all the other content that you should be investing for. However, if you wanted to invest, given the favorites, Spurs players, high rated/low priced Premier League golds/informs, and english players are the safest bet. 
These cards will likely be expensive this weekend because of the SBCs, so be cautious about what prices you are paying for them.
TOTW/MOTM Investments
In terms of long term investments this week, pickings are a bit slim. These picks are the very obvious ones and many will be looking to invest in them. Just keep that in mind before you pull the trigger at a price point. When thinking about when to pick these guys up, keep in the mind the number of promotions coming out this weekend and the dip that could bring.
IF Muriel: The Calico A is a bit lacking in budget strikers with pace (Gomez and Niang are your only real options). Because of his low card rating, his card weight will be very high. Look for that to push his price unreasonably low. 
MOTM Toure: Another unreal central player in the PL. Virtually every single one of them has proven to be a great investment because of their long term growth potential. Also has a chance to link with future AFCON TOTT players. 
MOTM Walcott: He’s fast, strong, and dangerously good a shooting. Combine that with an English flag and he’s got strong long term prospects in a position that’s a bit lacking in the PL.
MOTM Son: Probably the most obvious choice here. Spurs have an incredibly competitive list of special cards this year providing abundant strong link opportunities. Combine that with his incredible card stats and 5* weak foot and you’ve got really strong long term potential. On a side note, his current max at 300k is way too low for him. If you can snipe him now, then you should be in the money.
African Cup of Nations TOTT SBC
We’ve more or less confirmed that there will be a AFCON TOTT as well as a SBC that guarantees a TOTT player. There a many players that could get a TOTT card such as Mahrez and Salah that would make demand for such an SBC very high.
With this in mind, to invest for something like this, you could pick up players from African nations (especially players from Egypt and Cameroon, the two teams in the final), cheap iMOTM/MOTM cards, and any other discard special cards (IFs, TOTGS, Movember, etc.) you can get your hands on. 
League SBC investing
There are a number of League SBCs that have yet to drop including but not limited to; the Premier League, Calcio A, Bundesliga, etc.
For those of you that don’t know, in order to complete the league SBCs, you essentially need to turn in full teams for each team in the league to get the reward at the end (which often includes a large sum of coins and a special card).
With this in mind, there are a number of players on different teams (especially in the lesser known leagues) that only have one player in the game for certain positions. When the league SBCs drop, the demand for these players will be focused on them because they are the only option that can be used to complete the squad.
Ideally, you will want to identify these players and invest in them before the league SBC drops. The best type of player to invest in would be silver players who are the only option in their position. The relative rarity of silver players generally causes them to go extinct whereas gold players will rise but often not to extinction.

We got a heads up earlier today that FUT Live was coming Tuesday of next week. In it, we'll find all about the new Icons in FIFA 18, ratings, the new features and the game, and likely plenty of surprises along the way.
Giving us a taste of things to come, the FIFA 18 (!) production team revealed not just the ratings for one of the most anticipated Icons of next year's game, but also the design we can expect to see on Icons and standard issue items alike:

                        Another stacked side ahead with Messi, Dybala, Insigne, Isco and a OTW Jovetic all being potential IF's 
                    

Last weeks score: N/A
Formation: 3-4-1-2 - http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/4700867/

Goalkeeper
Rui Patricio - GK - 84 OVR
We start proceedings with another high rated keeper in Patricio. The Ballon D'or nominee made a total of six saves to help Sporting to a 1-0 home win of Rio Ave of which the Portuguese stopper claimed MOTM for with an 8/10 from Abola. There was a lack of goalkeepers to select from this week and thus helping Patricio with his claim.
Defenders
Lukasz Piszczek - RB - 82 OVR
The Polish defender was involved heavily offensively for Dortmund in their 3-0 win over Wolfsburg, playing a part in every goal they scored. Firstly causing the OG with a cross before scoring the second and assisting Dembele (another player in with a chance) for the third. 
Jaume Costa - LB - 79 OVR
Costa was involved in the only goal of the game with an assist for Villarreal as they won 1-0 away at Sociedad. The Spaniard went on to pick up MOTM for what could turn out to be a vital contribution come the end of the season.
Danilo D'Ambrosio - LB - 75 OVR
D'Ambrosio assisted the only goal of the game as Inter scraped a 1-0 win over Bologna which saw the Italian pick up a 7/10 from Gazzetta. The defence was difficult to predict this week so the inevitable high rated players shoved in could well come from the defensive positions.
Midfielders
Lorenzo Insigne - LW - 84 OVR
With Insigne receiving a ratings refresh his SIF now looks insane should he get the nod. I think there is a high probability of that happening though after the winger picked up both a goal and assist in Napoli's 3-1 away win which saw him claim a 7.5 from Gazzetta.
Paulo Dybala - CAM - 85 OVR
Dybala's previous IF came under rather controversial circumstances during what was the start of shoving high rated players in for the sake of it. Although that trend appears to be continuing now the Argentine actually deserves a spot this time after playing a big part in Juventus's 4-1 win. Occupying the CAM role once again Dybala scored twice and assisted another which saw him pick up MOTM with an 8/10 from Gazzetta.
Isco - CM - 84 OVR
Arguably a little cheap for what will be an 88 rated TIF but either way Isco stood out in Madrid's 2-0 home win over Espanyol, assisting both of their goals which saw him pick up 3*'s from Marca alongside MOTM.
Lionel Messi - RW - 93 OVR 
Under usual circumstances I wouldn't consider Messi unless he bagged a hat trick however it is now week 23 and he is still yet to pick up an IF. Due to that I feel as though his brace in Barcelona's 2-1 win over Leganes is an opportunity for them to give him an IF and with the current trend I don't think its one they miss out on.
Forwards
Kevin Gameiro - ST - 83 OVR
With the scores level at one a piece Madrid looked to Gameiro to change the game, subbing him on in the 62nd minute. He took until the 80th to turn up but when he did he changed the game to say the least. The French striker scored in the 80th, 81st and 85th minute to claim one of the fastest hat tricks in history which saw Madrid come away with a 4-1 win.
Stevan Jovetic - ST - 81 OVR
We saw no less than 4 OTW items pick up upgrades in week 22 and although there are not as many obvious candidates this time Jovetic makes a shout to be one. The Montenegrin picked up two assists for Sevilla as they maintain their chase at the top with a 2-0 win over Eibar.
Javier Hernandez - ST - 83 OVR
Although it was Havertz who picked up both MOTM and player of the week in Germany I feel as though he will be snubbed for Hernandez due to the gold bias and the fact Hernandez also put in a shift. The Mexican striker found the net twice for Leverkusen as they picked up a 3-1 away win over Augsburg.
Substitutes
Yoan Cardinale - GK - 75 OVR
In a match which Balotelli claimed the headlines for all the wrong reasons, becoming only the 11th player to pick up a 1/10 from L'equipe since 1999. Cardinale was the star man making a total of five saves to help Nice somehow come away with a 1-0 away win over Lorient. His performance saw him pick up many plaudits alongside an 8/10 from L'equipe.
Christopher Jullien - CB - 73 OVR
I personally preferred the old ways of a silver/bronze bench but with it looking as though a gold bench is the way forward now. Despite that I am taking the punt on a couple of silver this week, the first of which is Jullien. Toulouse managed to keep out PSG with a 0-0 draw and it was the big defender who stood out, picking up MOTM for his defensive display.
Corentin Tolisso - CAM - 78 OVR
Tolisso picked up MOTM during Lyon's 4-2 home win over Dijon for scoring both the first and second goals for Lyon. His brace saw him pick up an 8/10 from L'equipe which made him one of only three players to be awarded with that.
Konstantin Vassiljev - CAM - 72 OVR
After already picking up a silver IF earlier in the season another brilliant performance from the Estonian means he looks set to get upped to a gold. Jagiellonia managed a convincing 5-0 win of which Konstantin both scored and assisted two each of. 
Youri Tielemans - CM - 77 OVR
Not only have we seen some huge bias towards the Belgian league recently but Tielemans has been nothing short of superb, beginning to show just why there is so much hype surrounding him. The youngster scored twice from long range during Anderlecht's 4-1 away win which despite being close to his previous IF could well be enough.
Emil Forsberg - LM - 76 OVR
When Leipzig are performing well a lot of the time it is Forsberg pulling the strings. Once again that was the case during 2-1 away win over Gladbach with the Swede grabbing both a goal and assist, picking up MOTM with a 1.5 in the process.
Gregoire Defrel - ST - 75 OVR 
I'm not entirely sure if Defrel did infact come on at ST but the logical explanation would be that he did. Either way once the Frenchman came on he changed to game, scoring two goals which saw Sassuolo come away with the 2-1 win.
Reserves
Takumi Minamino - RM - 71 OVR
You guessed it the Austrain league is back and what a surprise that we open proceedings with a Salzburg IF. Minamino was involved in four of their goals with three of his own going alongside an assist for Radosevic. Salzburg went on to win the match 6-1 against bottom placed Ried.
Pierre Webo - ST - 73 OVR
Webo picked up the headlines, not for his goal scoring but for his assists of which he managed an impressive four of during his sides 5-1 away win. If the four assists was not enough he also scored the other goal. Not a bad day at the office.
Jimmy Smith - CM - 60 OVR
Just the one inclusion from the Npower mid-week schedule features in my side and it comes from a superb display from the Crawley midfielder. Smith scored the perfect hat trick to help guide his side to a narrow 3-2 win over Colchester.
Alvaro Ramos - ST - 68 OVR
Another Chilean IF looks set to feature after Ramos bagged all three Iquique goals in a 3-1 home win over Cobresal. An interesting position change from RM to ST however despite his pace he only stands at 5ft 5 which could be a problem in terms of FUT.
Adam Rooney - ST - 71 OVR
Aberdeen went on a goal spree on Wednesday putting seven past Motherwell of whom could only muster two of their own. Rooney was the stand out player scoring three and assisting another however it is worth mentioning that Christie also scored a goal which has been nominated for the Puskas award."

                        The sides just keep getting better and better with no less than twelve 85+ rated players to get excited for!
                    

Last week’s score 17/23
Formation - 3-4-1-2 Squad link:  http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/5008904/

Goalkeeper
Artur Boruc - GK - 76 OVR
Bournemouth managed to halt United’s progression to finally climb out of 6th position with a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford. A big part of that game down to their Polish stopper in Boruc after he made a total of six saves of which included an Ibra penalty while playing the second half with only 10 men.
Defenders
Bernat - LB - 79 OVR
For once there were several defenders which stood out and one of those was Bernat. The Spanish LB was involved in two Munich goals, with a goal and an assist, alongside helping them to keep a clean sheet in their 3-0 win. 
Hector Moreno - CB - 80 OVR
For the second time this season Moreno has scored twice, this time he kept a clean sheet rather than conceding three though and thus should be included. There is reason to doubt him though after a mediocre match rating. We saw the same happen with Jetro the other week though.
Javi Martinez - CB - 85 OVR
I can't recall a time when two defenders from the same game have received an IF and it may not happen this time either but as far as chances go this is a good one. Martinez picked up MOTM for the opening goal in Bayern's previously mentioned 3-0 win with a perfect 1 mark from Kicker.
Midfielders
Ivan Perisic - LM - 84 OVR
Inter cruised their way to a 5-1 away win over Cagliarli this week and it was their Croatian winger who stood out. Perisic scored two of the goals which saw him pick up MOTM with an impressive match rating of 8/10.
Lionel Messi - RW - 93 OVR
Believe it or not Messi has been snubbed a few times already this year with the speculation of EA snubbing him due to the breakdown of contracts increasingly growing. Although that is all halfhearted talk there really will be talk if he misses out this time. The Argentine both scored and assisted two goals in another Barca romp.
Ousmane Dembele - RW - 80 OVR
Although Dembele was more part of an impressive team performance than anything else with the additional incentive of a OTW item I can see him getting the nod here. The Frenchman scored one and assisted another as Dortmund recorded a 6-2 home win over Leverkusen.
Marko Arnautovic - RM - 82 OVR
The Austrian has been very quiet this season so far but despite that he is now in line for his TIF after he scored another brace for Stoke. This time it came as they won 2-0 at home to Middlesbrough.
Forwards
Antoine Griezmann - ST - 88 OVR
Griezmann has not quite hit the heights of last year’s astonishing season which is by no means an easy feat. The Frenchman netted twice this weekend though during a 3-0 win at home to Valencia which could well see him pick up his first IF.
Karim Benzema - ST - 87 OVR
Usually we are racking up a fourth or fifth special Benzema item by now but it's not worked out that way this season. The Frenchman will be picking up his first however after scoring two and assisting another during Madrid's 4-1 away win over Eibar.
Dries Mertens - ST - 85 OVR
There gets a point when the items are just getting ridiculous for certain players and I think Mertens can now fall into that category should be pick up another IF on Wednesday. The Belgian continued his amazing form since being moved to ST with another two goals, this time away at Roma in a vital 2-1 win. He picked up another 8/10 from Gazzetta and looks to be one of the most in-form players worldwide right now.
Substitutes
Sebastian Rudy - CDM - 78 OVR
Hoffenheim recorded an impressive 5-2 win over Ingolstadt which gives them a 4-point gap ahead of 5th position in their quest for a Champions league spot. Rudy was involved in both the first and second goals with a goal and an assist which saw him pick up a 1.5 from Kicker.
Fabian Johnson - LM - 79 OVR
This week’s Kicker POTW was awarded to Johnson of whom scored twice for Gladbach in a 4-2 win over Schalke. In general, it was a high scoring week in Germany which resulted in multiple options being available, Johnson is one who is nailed on though.
Florian Thauvin - RW - 81 OVR
Ligue 1 offered next to nothing in terms of IF options but there will be at least one included that’s for sure. Thauvin is the only stand out option for that spot after the winger scored one and assisted another two in Marseilles 4-1 away win.
Jese - LW - 80 OVR
Jese put in two good performances this week but specifically the one against Osasuna is what I have included him for. The Spaniard has started off life at Las Palmas well after failing to break into the PSG side. He scored twice during their 5-2 home win claiming MOTM in the process.
Andrea Belotti ST - 80 OVR
If there was one player which I had to point out for a transfer in the summer that player without a doubt is Belotti. The young Italian has carried Torino into 9th position with no less than 22 goals in the 24 games he has played. That is some tally for a mid-table side for a 22-year-old. 
Llorente - ST - 79 OVR
Llorente is slowly becoming to Swansea of what Michu was to them a few seasons ago. The Spaniard scored another two goals to take his tally to 11 for the season during their 3-2 win at home to Burnley. The striker also hit the woodwork which would have confirmed his spot but I still feel that two goals is enough for him.
Marcus Berg - ST - 80 OVR 
With the influx of golds, it is becoming increasingly easy for ""lesser"" league golds to be included. Although on paper Berg scored a hat trick two of those goals did come from the spot which has often ruled players out. Panathinaikos won the game by a convincing 5-0 score line and with the extra gold slots I highly doubt Berg misses out.
Reserves
Timofey Kalachev - RB - 74 OVR
Rostov came away with an impressive opening day win of which there were a couple of standout players from. I have gone with Kalachev for his three assists. He may well miss out due to Azmoun having the gold advantage however with three assists and a clean sheet to his name he becomes very difficult to ignore.
Ricky Holmes - RM - 66 OVR
There are quite a few reasons as to why Holmes is a doubt but with a hat trick from midfield, in my eyes that’s enough for anyone to be included. The doubts come as; one, Charlton lost 4-3 and two, the game was played on a Tuesday. Should EA cover the game and stick to previous strategies than come Wednesday we will see an IF Holmes though.
Josh Koroma - CAM - 47 OVR
Despite being up for the award of worst IF in the history of FIFA Koroma deserves his spot in the side after finding the back of the net three times for Orient in their 4-0 away win over Newport.
Nathan Redmond - RM - 75 OVR
There were only a few possibilities from the BPL and two of those came from Southampton with both Redmond and Tadic performing to a high standard. I have opted for Redmond who scored twice however Tadic with one goal and two assists is also very viable.
Samuel Di Carmine - ST - 66 OVR
Serie B has not received much love in terms of IF's this FIFA but when a striker gets a hat trick that’s often a good indicator that they will be getting an IF. Di Carmine did just that scoring three of Perugia's five goals in their 5-0 win"

                        Welcome back to another week of the Fut Roundup! I hope you are all feeling refreshed after that week jam packed with FUT content! Get it? Refreshed? *Sigh* Don’t even bother linking the logout, I’ll see myself out.
                    

In all seriousness, what a week. We have lots to cover, so we’ll start with a recap of the week, followed by a look ahead at the week ahead, and top it off with a discussion on investing and other coin making tips. 
The main talking point this week is the Rating Refresh (the equivalent of winter upgrades from last year). Over the course of ten days in a promotion running from the 17th to the 27th, EA have refreshed the ratings of over 400 players. Below is the blurb EA put on their database about the event.

We talked about it briefly in last week’s roundup, but this year EA surprised us with a number of curveballs. The first was that they upgraded all tiers of special cards as long as the first inform was affected by the refresh. Many, including myself, were apprehensive about investing in in the special cards of certain upgrade candidates because of the rating gap between their multiple IFs (Ex. The 2 overall gap between TOTGS Dembele and IF Dembele). This was not something we had precedent for in the past, but EA decided to maintain the integrity of the higher informs by upgrading them despite the gaps. 
EA also changed the requirements for what it meant for a first inform to be affected by a rating refresh. Since low rated players received such generous boosts on their IF cards this year (especially first informs), EA decided that if a lower rated card received a significant enough upgraded, that it could be sufficient to affect the IF rating. You can see the official language from EA on this matter below. 
A perfect example of all of these new rules being applied was Ousmane Dembele’s card(s). The original gold card received a +3 overall boost, pushing him to an 80. EA deemed this jump large enough to be worthy of affecting his first special card which happened to be an 82 rated TOTGS card. This was bumped up to an 83. Following from this, even though this 83 TOTGS did match or surpass the rating of his 84 rated IF, they upgraded the 84 rated IF to an 85. This also meant that his OTW card bumped up from an 84 to an 85. As a side note, how about that +8 pace upgrade!


Another random curveball that EA threw was that Movember and Scream cards were not included in the refresh when it came to upping a player’s overall (they still, however, received stat boosts). Most expected that Movember cards would not be included in the upgrades since those special cards were not earned for outstanding in-game performances like most special cards. However, many were surprised that scream cards were left out, as they were essentially given as part of a regular TOTW. 
This year we also had downgrades as part of the rating refresh. Fan favorites such as Boateng and Cabella were dished out downgraded cards. On a side note, Cabella's silver card looks like an outrageously good silver, especially considering the effectiveness of his gold. 

So the real question is, how did all of this affect prices and what do we have left to look forward to on the 27th? In general, leading up to this ratings refresh, the investing hype had died significantly. This was especially true for many special cards with rating gaps between cards and low rated base cards. Investors were spooked by the reasons I mentioned earlier. When the market realized the official rules made these fears irrelevant, the prices of cards such as OTW Kante, OTW Mane, and others jumped significantly because the market had not priced in their upgrade potential. However, for someone like Sanchez. who was a well known upgrade candidate, when his refresh was released his price momentarily jumped but was quickly pushed down as high volumes of investors sold. After the market realized how the rule changes would affect special cards in other leagues, they invested, pushing up the prices of all popular upgrade candidates which had fallen because of the uncertainties. This meant that when the refreshed ratings dropped, their upgraded potential was already priced in, making it difficult to sell for profit if you planned on selling after the announcement. The only exceptions to this were the cards that received unexpected large stat boosts such as Mane and Dembele. Ironically, this overselling actually led to price decreases that were large enough to allow for short term flipping. 
In addition, as mentioned there were a number of fan favorites that received downgrades. Many picked up their original cards as a long term investment, banking on their prices rising since they went out of packs. Finally, we saw people paying ridiculous prices for the stat boosted versions of the cards. And I mean truly ridiculous. The example floating around was that people were paying a 354% premium for upgraded Dybala who only received a +1 boost to his passing and defense.

In other news, as predicted, top Premier League players and legends (especially top tier legends)  took heavy hits after the Premier League, weekend league. Prices hit their lowest Monday morning and based on the sharp increase in the prices of top Bundesliga and Liga Santander players, players quickly shifted the funds from those sales to their new teams. This served as yet another example of needing to understand market sentiment in the moment. The prices of these Bundesliga/Liga Santander players did not rise throughout the week as many had predicted. It was clear that this would happen based on how dramatically they rose in price on Sunday and Monday. Any more of an increase would have been unreasonable. A tool for understanding something like this is by looking at the percentage increase from comparable, past events. A convenient example this past week were the price increases of top Premier League players who had risen, on average, by about 30%. When Bundesliga/Liga Santander players jumped 35%, this should have served as an indication to sell your investments. 
The battle for Premier League POTM is heating up as well. Lukaku’s one goal performance against Sunderland seems to give him the edge over the likes of Harry Kane and others. February saw Lukaku grab 5 goals in a month where Everton went 2-1-0. Kane, on the other hand, picked up 4 goals and an assist in February, a month where Spurs finished 2-0-1 in POTM relevant games. Because of scheduling technicalities, there are only 3 relevant games for February’s POTM. This means that aside from the two postponed between Sunderland v. Arsenal and Man City v. Man United stats for this month are finalized (we are not sure if EA will count these matches, but it is likely that they won’t). 
At the time Lukaku’s goal against Sunderland on Saturday appeared to make him a lock for the POTM. This pushed up the prices of many Belgian IFs as the market remembered the Hazard POTM requirements. However, investors were given a scare on Sunday when Kane’s first half hat trick catapulted him into contention. This lead to a bit of panic selling and has reopened the window for investing. Accordingly, we’ll be talking about this in the coin making section.
Speaking of making coins, under the radar, the prices of 82-85 rated golds has dropped significantly with many of them hitting all time lows. Of particular interest are the newly upgraded 83-85 gold cards which remain low despite their SBC potential. We’ll talk more about that in the coin making section. 
In other news, we received two more batches of MOTM cards on the 19th and the 24th. The highlight of which was a CAM Mkhitaryan, whose 5 star weak foot and fantastic card stats, make him a solid candidate for the best CAM in the game. Just look at his IG stats with a Hunter! 

Here are the two MOTM releases from the 22nd and 24th respectively. Looks like Smolov’s TOTS is going to be unreal, as always.


In miscellaneous news, Carrasco’s upgrade to an 84 makes completing the Atletico Madrid portion of the Suarez SBC that much easier. In addition, a number of player faces were updated. And finally, the Miami regionals on the 19th showcased a number of ridiculous longshots from TOTY Messi, temporarily boosting his price by a couple 100k. 
FUT - The Week Ahead
It appears that we are entering into a bit of a lull in terms of official FIFA promotions over the next couple weeks. In all honesty, the market needs this, badly. High churn (brought on by weekend league requirements and new, attractive upgrade candidates) has sucked coins out of the market thanks to the tax and willingness to undercut, devaluing many high end players. Looking at the week ahead, we’ll focus on three events, the final batch of rating refreshes, the lack of weekend league requirements, and the start of POTM voting. 
Final Batch of Rating Refreshes - February 27th
According to a quick count, EA have refreshed the ratings of 301 base cards thus far in the promotion. According to the blurb on their database we looked at earlier, that means 100+ cards will have their ratings refreshed on the 27th. Some of the more popular contenders for upgrades include MOTM Sow and MOTM Podolski. Of the two, it’s looking far more likely that Podolski will get the upgrade considering that he was upgraded in Head to Head and career mode. This means that his 85 MOTM could jump to an 86! 

Open Weekend League Requirements
This isn’t really an event but it’s a significant non-event. As I’m sure you are well aware, the past two weekend leagues have required players to make teams from a limited player pool. This forced many to make significant changes to their first teams. This led to high churn. In the world of FUT, high churn sucks coins off the market because of the combination of the EA tax and undercutting. We’ve also just recently learned that the requirements for the next two weekend leagues are open. This should help the market recover a bit and will form the basis for many of our investments in the next section. 
Opening of POTM Voting - March 3rd
Finally, unless EA decide to break the pattern, the POTM candidates will be announced and voting will commence on the first Friday of March (Aka March 3rd). Voting will end Monday, March 6th and the winner will be announced on the 10th along with the accompanying SBC. The announcement of the nominees this month will be particularly important because the race is tight. The two front runners are Lukaku and Kane but both are relatively unconvincing candidates when compared to previous months. This opens the door for a midfielder or even a defender such as Smalling. 
With this in mind, many investors will feel much more confident in investing when the nominees are officially announced and we could see a bump in investment prices. We’ll be talking more about this in the coin making section. For now, enjoy these potential Lukaku and Harry Kane POTM cards. 

Making Coins this Week
As mentioned earlier, the underlying thesis for many of the coin making tips this week revolve around the two unrestricted weekend leagues that we have coming up. Combine this with what appears to be a lull in content, and we have a recipe for a much needed price recovery. 
Sniping Refreshes & Trick Listing
As we discussed above, the prices of many of the newly upgraded cards are trading at steep premiums. However, believe it or not, there are many average FUT players that are unaware of this and will list the upgraded versions at the price of the original. This provides ample opportunities for sniping. 
Look for players that are traded in high volumes (usually low rated cards that are popular, eg. Kante) and see if you can snipe them. I’ve had many people on twitter send me screenshots of these players sniped at prices that would even be considered snipes for the original card.
The best times to do this are when the upgraded cards are freshly released. Unfortunately, this means that the much of the window for sniping has passed. However, assuming you are reading this the couple hours after it was posted, we have the 100+ rest of the world rating refreshes to look forward to. 
This also works better if there is a high volume of packs being opened. One time to be on the lookout for this is when weekend league rewards are released on Thursday. 
If you need tips on sniping, there are many tutorials on youtube that demonstrate the most effective way to refresh your search without being transfer banned
If you manage to pick up one of these cards, make sure that you list it as soon as possible. The prices of these upgraded cards are likely to trend down. 
Bundesliga/Liga Santander Investing
Similar to last week with the Premier League players, high end Liga Santander and Bundesliga players have taken heavy hits because of people selling them after the weekend league. As we mentioned earlier, last week, Premier League players hit their lowest prices mid-day Monday. It is likely that a similar trend will happen this week. Two other important conclusions that we can make from last week include;

The top players took the biggest hit but also saw the biggest rebound. 
There have been a number of cards that have become fan favorites over this weekend such as MOTM Casimero, upgraded 85 Dembele, among others that will likely drop but have great long term potential (below is an example team of players high end players that have either become fan favorites over the weekend or were already popular) 


One thing to note when picking up these players is that when supply heavily outweighs demand (as it is doing in this case), winning players on bid is far more effective than getting them on snipe, because the only real demand are from investors. Many investors can’t be bothered to buy cards on bid, which significantly reduces competition. But if you are short on coins, this can be a great way to stretch your investing budget. 
POTM Investing
Investing in the POTM is a bit more risky this month because of how close the race is. While I do think that Lukaku is the favorite, Kane is in with a decent shout. With this in mind, let's remind ourselves of the potential requirements.

Informs from the nation of the winner
Lukaku
Belgian Informs


Kane
English Informs 




High rated players from the winner’s team 
Lukaku
His own card, Coleman, etc.


Kane
His own card, eriksen, etc.




Informs/high rated Premier League players 
Shawcross, Trippier, Santi Cazorla, etc.


1-2 Player from Previous teams
Lukaku
Anderlecht
Chelsea
West Brom
Everton


Kane
Leyton Orient
Millwall
Norwich City
Leicester City




1-2 Player from opponents this month
Lukaku
Bournemouth
Middlesbrough
Sunderland


Kane
Middlesbrough
Liverpool
Stoke





If you want to be safe, the best option here will be to sell these investments before the actual winner is announced on the 10th, especially the more risky investments such as informs from their home nations. Then, as soon as you see the requirements released, be on console to try and immediately pick up any curveballs.
82-85 Club Restocking
Under the radar, 82-85 rated gold cards have hit all time lows. The market seems to have forgot how useful these cards can be for SBCs. If you haven’t already, now would be a great time to restock your club full of one of each of the cheaper cards in each rating iteration. 
Once you do this, you can hold them until mid-late March because we have Saint Patrick's Day and the FIFA Birthday event coming up which both have SBC potential. 
One type of card to look at in particular are the newly upgraded cards in each of these rating iterations. Many of them don’t have their SBC potential priced in yet and are trading at extremely low prices. 
Irish investments
This one isn’t rocket science, but for some reason, people seem to have forgotten about Irish investing. Many of the Irish informs, gold cards, and cornered cards from other leagues have fallen in price. 
Obviously, the premise for this investment is the anticipation of a Saint Patrick’s Day promotion. Instead of a tournament like in previous years, we are expecting SBCs. We already know that there are Irish cards in the database (see below for an example of the card color), so chances of a SBC are fairly high.

General Tips:

You’ll want to invest in a wide range of Irish players. Try and cover a couple from each league. You may want to pick up a couple informs as well. Although, be careful with the informs because many of them are trading at premiums.
The best way to get these players is on a snipe. As we mentioned, many of them are trading at a premium, but the average FUT player does not know that. This provides for perfect opportunities to pick up great deals.
Depending on how much hype these investments get, you’ll likely want to sell into the hype. The hype is just starting to grow so be careful you don’t buy some of the more popular picks at a premium.
Stay away from the bronze Irish players. Many people did the bronze pack method this year, and Irish players are one of the main staples of that method. There are too many people that have them for bronze Irish players to rise. 

League SBC investing
There are a number of League SBCs that have yet to drop including but not limited to; the Premier League, Calcio A, Bundesliga, etc.
For those of you that don’t know, in order to complete the league SBCs, you essentially need to turn in full teams for each team in the league to get the reward at the end (which often includes a large sum of coins and a special card).
With this in mind, there are a number of players on different teams (especially in the lesser known leagues) that only have one player in the game for certain positions. When the league SBCs drop, the demand for these players will be focused on them because they are the only option that can be used to complete the squad.
Ideally, you will want to identify these players and invest in them before the league SBC drops. The best type of player to invest in would be silver players who are the only option in their position. The relative rarity of silver players generally causes them to go extinct whereas gold players will rise but often not to extinction."

                        At the beginning of the year, EA promised they would be bring more unique content to FUT than ever before. They have certainly lived up to that promise, and this past week was another example of them doing so. Let’s start this week’s roundup by taking a look back at the major FUT related events of the past 7 days and then analyze how they affected the market. We’ll then look to the week ahead and wrap up with a discussion on how we can make coins.
                    

The headline for this week was the OTW promotion. As the tweet from Sky Sports had suggested, the promo started the 3rd and will run until the 10th. The event featured a new batch of winter OTW items (based on players who made moves in the January transfer window), promo packs from the 3rd to the 5th, and tradable/untradeable summer/winter guaranteed OTW SBCs.

With the exception of Gabriel Jesus, who climbed to the preposterously high price point of 550k after scoring twice against Swansea, there are no heavy hitters in the winter edition. However, many were eager to try their luck at the summer OTW SBCs in hopes of packing one of the elite items from earlier in the year.
The requirements for these SBCs (see below) caught us off guard. Many, including myself, were doubtful that EA would require a OTW item and assumed the SBC would require a high minimum rating instead. Unfortunately, it was virtually the opposite. When the SBCs dropped, many who had invested in 84s and 85s panic sold as a knee jerk reaction to the low minimum rating. However, this proved to be shortsighted. Once the community discovered how easy it was to repeat the untradeable summer SBC by recycling the OTW they received from the guaranteed pack, virtually everyone was buying up 81-85 gold players to try their luck at packing OTW Pogba. In the beginning of the week, one submission of the untradable, summer OTW SBC only cost around 12k. A small wager considering OTW Pogba, Kante, and Dembele were all possibilities.

Because of this, after a period of about 24 hours, the existing supply of 81-83 rated cards came under stress and their prices began to rise. Many rose by as much as 100%! After a slightly longer delay, 84-85 rated cards followed suite. This category of cards will likely continue to rise until late Thursday at which point panic sellers and last minute SBC hopefuls will level each other out before prices fall steeply to their watermark levels after the SBC expires.
In addition, early in the week, all cheap, low demand OTW cards rose to roughly 50k as many looked to purchase their first OTW cards so they could start the SBC cycle mentioned above. As expected that price point has came down to the high 30s as the week drew on. Based on patterns from previous SBCs it is likely that these low demand, low priced OTWs will hit their lowest price points of the promotion on Thursday before rebounding slightly Friday afternoon and then falling again once the promotion wraps up. 
These SBCs also dramatically pushed down the prices of high demand OTW items, especially the ultra inflated summer elites. For example, OTW Pogba dropped all the way down from 2.6 to 1.4 million! Many investors are taking advantage of the decreased prices of these OTW items and have decided to invest. We’ll talk more about this in the coin making section. 
As we predicted last week, this promotion contributed to a major dip in prices for high demand, high priced players. In fact, prices for elite golds, legends, and high level informs managed to hit TOTY crash levels. This happened for a number of reasons. The first was that many investors were so eager to try the SBCs that they liquidated much of their club and investments. This was seen most clearly by how hard many of the popular TOTW 19 investments dipped, indicating that investors were prematurely liquidating. In addition, anytime anyone completed the SBC, it took buying power off the market. This is especially true for the untradable SBC because the user permanently lost the value of the players that they turned in. In this case, buying power is equivalent to demand, and, of course, when demand falls without a corresponding change in supply, prices fall. Finally, with the release of every new batch of competitive special cards, EA continues to split demand for the existing high end cards. These MOTM cards are a great of example of that happening. The likes of Son and Walcott convinced many players to sell the existing players in their club such as Aguero, IF Willian, IF Lukaku, etc. to pick up these newly coveted items.We’ll talk about the future price forecast for elite cards in the coin making section.
Another example of a major card release was the African Cup of Nations TOTT. This squad dropped on Friday and featured Mane, Salah, and Koulibaly. To go along with that, EA also dropped a non-repeatable, guaranteed AFCON TOTT SBC. This SBC pushed up the prices of players from African nations dramatically for roughly 12 hours. However, once people realized it was non-repeatable, prices quickly normalized. In fact, you can now do the SBC for as little as 7000 coins should you wanted to try your luck. Two things of note here; if a player already received an iMOTM card (i.e. Salah) they did not receive a separate TOTT card, and Mane’s 84 rated TOTT card did not push up the rating of his OTW (remember that only TOTW cards affect the rating of OTW cards). However, if he manages to get another IF with Liverpool, his OTW rating will jump from an 82 to an 86. We’ll talk more about this and other OTW investing in the coin making section.

Other big news this week included the long awaited drop of a new league SBC. This time around it was the Liga Santander. The featured player was a 94 rated Suarez card (see below). Given that he was highest scorer in the league last year, it further confirmed that EA are choosing who is featured in the league SBC based on this accolade. That means we can also look forward to the likes of SBC Kane, Aubameyang, and Higuain!

When this SBC was dropped, EA were forced to bump up the price ranges for a select few Liga Santander silver cards, and many high rated gold cards and informs on Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, and Barca because the SBC requirements cornered them. Unfortunately for those looking to unlock SBC Suarez, there are some teams and positions where the only option is one or two silver cards that are incredibly rare and they may run you as much as 35k with the new price ranges. All things considered, the SBC is not that expensive. At current prices, it will cost you in the range of 600-750k with a return of 400k+ in pack and coin rewards. Over time, similar to SBC lacazette, I expect the cornered silver cards to remain relatively high (until they release promo silver packs) and the gold cards/IF requirements to drop in price as gold cards continued to get packed throughout the year and new IFs that meet the SBC requirements (Ex. IF Torres from this week) come out in future TOTWs. With this in mind, we can pre-invest for future league SBCs in positions where potential options are limited. We’ll talk more about this in the coin making section. 
A bright spot this week is that a glance at the weekly match earnings leaderboard would suggest that the coin farming glitch has largely been stomped out. If this were in fact the case, it would help explain why player prices have dropped so hard. Again, we’ll expand on the price dip in the coin making section. 

EA also dropped a monstrous TOTW 21 this Wednesday featuring the likes of Hazard, Mertens, Lukaku, Hamsik, Mkhitaryan, and Sokratis. Many have even gone as far as to say that this is the greatest TOTW in FUT history. There are certainly some great investments in here. Winter upgrades could throw a wrench in the equation, but we’ll talk about in the coin making section. 

In miscellaneous news, MOTM Son dropped from 300k down to 220k after his price range was bumped up to 500k. Many investors were hoarding the card after they had sniped him for 300k. Once the price range was raised, everyone that had been hoarding him listed at the same time and pushed his price way down. In addition, EA announced that from now on, weekly rewards would be released on Thursdays at 18:00 UTC (1pm Est & 6pm UK). This will make IF prices a bit more interesting to track on Thursday evenings.

FUT - The Week Ahead
Similar to last week, we have a lot to look forward to this week in the world of FUT. In terms of our analysis this week, we’ll focus on the tw0 main events; the first batch of winter upgrades, and a potential Valentine's Day promotion (Also, for anyone that cares, I have my first Econometrics exam next Thursday… so that should be fun). 
First Batch of Winter Upgrades - February 10th
Friday has the potential to be quite a lively day. We originally guessed that the first round of winter upgrades would drop last week, but that was likely pushed back because of the OTW promotion. Many are now guessing that the first round of four upgrade batches will drop on Friday.
Heading into the promotion, let’s remind ourselves what EA’s official rules from last year were. 

The main points that apply to us as traders are bullet points one and two. The second point will be particularly important this year. EA have been more generous with the rating upgrades this year for lower rated players, meaning that many have large gaps between their normal gold cards and the IFs. Some even have gaps between multiple versions of their inform cards. This means two things; many players that are lower rated will not receive a large enough upgrade to their gold card for it to affect their inform, and investing in upgrade candidates whose base gold card starts at 85+ is generally safest because the IF upgrade for these cards at this rating and higher is only a +1. 
There are also many questions about what types of cards will be upgraded. Here are my thoughts on that. Unfortunately, for a lot of the scenarios, we aren’t 100% sure, but here are my educated guesses/reasoning;
Most Confident

Pre-Existing Gold Cards: The cards that are already packed (the ones in your club) will not automatically be upgraded. Even if the player gets an upgrade. 
First IF’s: If the rating of their newly upgraded gold card is equal or higher rated than the the first IF, the first IF will automatically be upgraded so their rating is one overall higher than the upgraded card.
Ex. (If Mertens gets upgraded to an 85, his 85 rated first IF will bump to a 86)


Second/Third/Fourth IF without a gap: If there is no rating gap between the first and the second IF, then the second IF will be pushed up in rating so that it is one rating higher than the IF below it. 
OTW with other IFs: If a player with a OTW item already has an IF and the inform gets upgraded because of the winter upgrade, the OTW card should get upgraded as well.
TOTGS/iMOTM/Hero: They are special cards selected for outstanding performances similar to TOTW IFs. They should get upgraded following the same rules as the TOTW IFs.
Scream Cards: They were a regular TOTW released under a different type of promotion. They should follow the same upgrade rules. 
Silver IFs: Assuming they follow the model of years past, if a player has a silver card with a corresponding silver IF, and the silver card gets upgraded to a gold card, the silver IF will not be upgraded to gold IF. 
TOTY Cards/Legends/Pro Player Cards: No upgrade.

Least Confident

Movember Cards: They aren’t inform cards in the sense that they were given out for outstanding performances. These players were selected for either having a beard or being affiliated with the Movember foundation. That makes me hesitant. I would say they won’t get upgraded. 
OTW Cards without IFs: EA have said that only “TOTW in-forms” will affect the rating of OTW cards. But, if a player with a OTW item gets a winter upgrade without having gotten a IF yet, I’m assuming that the OTW will upgrade as well, but I’m not sure. 
Ex. OTW Morata


SBC Cards: This is the one that a lot of people want to know, but unfortunately it’s really anyone's’ guess want EA do. My first instinct, however, would be that they don’t get upgraded.
Multiple IF’s with Gaps: If there is a gap in the rating between a first inform and a second IF, and the first IF gets an upgrade my guess would be that EA upgrade the higher rated IFs the same amount. We’ve never seen this in past FIFA’s so we really don’t know if EA what EA will do.

Valentine's Day promotion - February 13th - 15th
Last year, EA ran a small promotion for Valentine’s Day. The promotion included discounted premium gold packs. The promotion ran for three days, one day on either side of the romantic holiday.

If you are planning on asking FIFA to be your valentine, it, unfortunately, doesn’t look like she’ll be the most exciting date. EA has shown a reluctance to do big back to back SBCs as we saw with the SBC drought that we had after FutMas. It seems far more likely that they’ll run discounted coin packs again or simply do a small SBC for a kit (there is no “Valentine’s Day” kit, but many think that this kit is the one we’ll see during the potential promotion)

There are also a number of SBCS that they could do, and of course the rumor mill is full to the brim. While none of them seem likely, let’s go over a couple:

An SBC for players that do heart celebrations when they score (Bale, Di Maria, etc.)
A SBC that requires Hearts players

Making Coins this Week
With all this in mind, it’s time to talk about how we make some coins this week. As of writing this, the market is in a lull. Buying power is low (SBC and coin packs), and supply is high (Promos and OTW cards), meaning it’s a great time invest! But first, as promised, we’ll start with a general market forecast. 
General Market Forecast
Coming off of TOTY we had one of the strongest market rallies in FUT history. Virtually every elite, weekend league calibre card, including elite gold's, high level informs, and legends, steadily rose in price. However, as we’ve talked about before, this was likely a result of a combination of strong buy day sentiment, coin farmers increasing the supply of coins, and a drought in promotional pack openings/SBCs. This lead to unsustainably high prices. While many will argue that prices should stay high because of weekend league this year, the counter to that has been, and increasingly will be, the demand splitting competitiveness of the special cards that EA release this year. At this point in the game, many people could run will full teams of untradable SBC players and more still have shifted away from the players that were popular early in the game’s life cycle in favor of some of the more recent special cards. 
With this in mind, the question is, have player prices fallen back down to normal, or have they dipped below their watermark. My guess is that they’ve dipped too low, especially some of the players we’ll talk about in a moment. While I don’t anticipate that these high end cards will rebound sharply, I anticipate that over the next couple weekend leagues you could see a decent uptick given that nothing major seems to be on the cards in terms of promotions other than winter upgrades. The big events that EA seem to be focusing on at this point seem to be the regional tournaments for the pro players. 
Winter upgrades
Last week I said that the window to invest in winter upgrade candidates had passed. Back then I assumed that the upgrade candidates would hold their value through this week. As it turns out, many have unloaded their investments, pushing their prices down by as much as 40% for some of the top investments. The play here is that you will want to pick up some of these players now because many of them will rebound organically, whether they are upgrade candidates or not, and then hold until the first week of upgrades. The market has seemingly forgot about winter upgrades and the hype has all but died. It could be reinvigorated again after the first batch of upgrades and you could have a window to quickly flip your cards.
That being said, you’ll want to stick to the higher rated upgrade candidates, or at least the ones that have a high chance of their upgrade affecting their IF. There are many great resources out there that can help you find upgrade candidates. One such resource is @GummiFIFA. He has compiled a list of players that have received upgrades in career mode and in H2H (good indicators of upgrades in FUT). I recommend checking him out if you are interested in trying your luck at this short term, high risk investment. 
Other options include;

After the first batch of upgrades is announced, any informs that didn’t get upgraded in the first batch may suffer from a bit of panic selling. This could lead to people listing the cards below their value regardless of winter upgrade potential. 
If it is announced that a player received an upgrade, but the upgrade is not large enough to change the rating of their IF, then there is a good chance that heavy panic selling will follow. Someone like Kante (who will likely not get the upgrade to an 84 required to affect his IF) could drop below his long-term value because of panic selling.
There will be opportunities to make coins off the gold cards
When the upgraded cards are put into packs, many people don't realize that they have packed an upgraded card and will list it at the price of the non-upgraded version. This will provide ample sniping opportunities.
One the flip side of this, many people will panic sell their gold cards when they find out they received an upgrade. However, the price difference over time, usually isn’t that large, especially for the higher rated cards. This means that there will be opportunities to pick up these cards on snipes as well as chances to turn around and list them for lazy buyers.



OTW Investing
These OTW SBCs have taken a heavy toll on the prices of many of the OTW cards, especially the summer ones. The likes of Kante, Dembele, Higuain, Pogba, Pjanic, and Mane are all interesting options because they are still in high demand and are doing well for their respective clubs. In addition, someone like Draxler or Niang (who was recently heavily panic sold) could be interesting options from the Winter batch of OTW cards. There are other options, these are just a few of the more obvious examples (remeber, if no one invests in the same card as you, you’re either terribly wrong, or about to strike it rich). 
The play here is to buy these cards within the next couple days, taking advantage of the increased supply from the SBC and packs, and then sell them when they start in a game, grab an assist, or score later down the line. At this point in the year, waiting for them to get a full on inform gets more and more risky because many of their seasons end in late May which is only 4 months away. For example, there are only 14 weeks left in the Premier League season. Now, this is not to scare you away from investing in them, because most would agree that they are undervalued at the moment, it’s just something to keep in mind. 
League SBC investing
There are a number of League SBCs that have yet to drop including but not limited to; the Premier League, Calcio A, Bundesliga, etc.
For those of you that don’t know, in order to complete the league SBCs, you essentially need to turn in full teams for each team in the league to get the reward at the end (which often includes a large sum of coins and a special card).
With this in mind, there are a number of players on different teams (especially in the lesser known leagues) that only have one player in the game for certain positions. When the league SBCs drop, the demand for these players will be focused on them because they are the only option that can be used to complete the squad.
Ideally, you will want to identify these players and invest in them before the league SBC drops. The best type of player to invest in would be silver players who are the only option in their position. The relative rarity of silver players generally causes them to go extinct whereas gold players will rise but often not to extinction.
High Value/Low Card Weight Trading
This is a method that works every year at the end of FIFA and it is starting to work once again this year. The basic idea is that you pick a dozen or so high value, low card weight IFs or other special cards and become an expert on their price. This expertise has to beyond knowing and studying their prices on futbin. You should know what they usually go for on bid, what prices they go for a different times of the day, etc. 
Because of their low card weight and high demand, these types of cards vary dramatically in price. An example of a card that works with this method is IF Mertens (don’t use that card because everyone else will). He varies wildly in price from one day to the next and can be picked up for cheap on bid. Start yourself a spreadsheet and keep track of the player prices throughout the day. Sooner or later you’ll grab one on bid via a snipe far below their going price.
You can also do this method with high end gold players and legends. It works particularly well if you can pick up fresh cards as many do not know that people are willing to pay exuberant prices just to have a fresh card. 
BPL Weekend League Requirements
After deleting them, EA have brought back the Premier League weekend league requirements. These requirements are for the weekend of the 17th. With this in mind, you can take advantage of the lull in prices and invest in some of the PL regulars such as Kante, Martial, Smalling, Walker, etc. You can then sell a couple days before the weekend league as people build their teams to compete. 

TOTW Investments
This TOTW high powered. The market's buying power is incredibly low right now. If we could combine this with a decent round of promo packs for Valentine’s Day, we could see TOTW 21 cards drop to attractive prices. Here are my picks this week:
Mertens - People love this card, his dribbling is out of this world, and he’s due for an upgrade that will reach his IFs. Because of that, this 88 card will be pushed to an 89. The key will be whether or not his upgrade is in the first batch of upgrades. 
Lukaku - I was tempted to copy and paste the tank, but I’ll save that for the comment section. I used his 87 and he had good dribbling and a thunderous shot. Great long term potential. Similar to Mertens, he is due for a winter upgrade that will affect his IF. Timing will be key.
Cuadrado - He’s fast, 5* skills, and a weekend league staple. What more can you ask for in terms of organic growth potential?
Hazard - You’ll need to shell out a pretty penny to get in on this one, but the market is poor right now and this might mean he’ll be undervalued. His long term, organic potential is strong."

                        As TOTW's go I think it's safe to say this is a good one.
                    

Last week's score 16/23
Formation: 3-4-1-2. Squad Link: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/5667155/

Goalkeeper
Andrea Consigli - GK - OVR 83
On paper Consigli only has six saves in a 1-1 draw away to Atlanta however when you take into consideration that Gazzetta rewarded him with an 8/10 you know that it was a good performance. When a keeper is rated that highly it is very rare for them to miss out and thus I fully expect to see an IF Consigli on Wednesday.
Defenders
David Abraham - CB - OVR 77
There are a few Bundesliga defenders in with a shout and on paper Abraham doesn’t look so impressive with just an assist in a 2-2 draw but seeing as he also got the highest kicker rating of the available defenders I have opted for him.
Pepe - CB - OVR 88
This one probably wouldn't occur if it wasn't such a big game but after scoring in a 1-1 draw during the Madrid derby I believe it increases his chances significantly. Not to mention that an 89-rated player never goes a miss. He would have been a certainty had Griezmann not scored a late goal to level the match but either way I think he has a good shout for this side.
Phil Jagielka - CB - OVR 82
Jagielka over the course of two games the Everton defender picked up two goals and an assist. Firstly, he scored Everton's only goal in a 1-1 draw with Man united before getting both a goal and an assist in their 4-2 win over Leicester.
Midfielders
Eden Hazard - LW - OVR 89
In a result that all but confirms Chelsea's title hopes leaves them seven points clear at the top. Hazard was once again the man behind the performance scoring both of their goals in a 2-1 win over City.  Although Hazard missed the penalty the fact he then scored from the rebound cancels that out in my eyes.
Lorenzo Insigne - LW - OVR 84
It's getting to the stage where I am predicting an IF Insigne almost every week, but the Italian winger is on that sort of form right now. Another two goals for him during Napoli's 3-0 win over Lazio saw him pick up an 8/10 which should be enough for his fourth IF of the season.
Arjen Robben - RM - OVR 87
Robben picked up Bundesliga POTW for his performance in Munich's 4-1 win over rivals Dortmund. Although the winger only picked up one of the goals he was by far the best player on the pitch and ran the show, as shown by his perfect 1 rating from Kicker.
Heung Min Son - LM - OVR 79
Tottenham are not giving up the title without a shout, after a late turnaround mid-week they managed to thrash Watford 4-0 at home. Son was involved in three of those four goals with two of his own alongside an assist. 88 rated Son? seems absurd but it’s likely to happen.
Forwards
Morata - ST - OVR 82
One OTW item which I expected to pick up a few IF's was Morata. As it turns out that has not been the case however after the Spaniard bagged himself a hat trick on Wednesday the first is now surely on the way. Madrid came away as 4-2 winners with Morata scoring the latter three Madrid goals.
Mario Balotelli - ST - OVR 81
You either love him or you hate him. If he's not getting sent off he’s actually quite a good player though. The Italian bagged himself another two goals for Nice on Friday as the French outlet recorded a 2-1 away win over Lille. Balotelli's performance earned him an 8/10 from L'equipe which was the joint highest of the week.
Edison Cavani - ST - OVR 86
Who really needs Ibra? Cavani has more than taken the role for PSG and hit his 28th and 29th goals of the season along with picking up an assist during PSG's 4-0 home win. He claimed an 8/10 from L'equipe which could make him set for a 91-rated item
Substitutes
Benjamin Lecomte - GK - OVR 79 
There are several Lorient players which stand a chance of making this side which makes the decision all that more difficult. Lecomte, Marveaux and Moukandjo all picked up an 8/10 for their 4-1 win over Lyon. With the lack of goalkeeping options once again I have opted for Lecomte though.**
Andres Guardado - CM - OVR 82
Guardado really shouldn't miss out after picking up an impressive goal and three assists for PSV this weekend however with two other Dutch league players picking up hat tricks he could well miss out. That is due to the league not often picking up many IF's for some reason and Guardado is the weakest of those three.
Jens Toornstra - CM - OVR 76
When Ajax managed to beat Feyenoord last week it looked as though the tides could well be turning but they have made a statement here after managing a huge 8-0 win over GA Eagles. Toornstra scored three of those eight and thus makes my side.
Pablo Fornals - CM - OVR 76
This one can be classified as a punt but when Barcelona lose there is usually an IF from the opposition. Malaga went on to win the game 2-0 while Fornals was the only player to pick up 3 From Marca and thus stands out. On paper, he only picked up an assist but from watching the youngster play previously he is a star in the making.
Wes Hoolahan - LM - OVR 77
Hoolahan scored twice and assisted another in a shock 7-1 win at home to Reading. Too little too late for Norwich but it won't help Readings morale in competing for the play offs.
Player - ST - OVR 00
Aaron Hunt - RM - 77 OVR
The other player in the Bundesliga with a perfect kicker score(1) was Hunt. The German scored both of Hamburg's goals in a 2-1 home win over Hoffenheim.
Bas Dost - ST - OVR 80
Bas Dost is literally the definition of IF at the moment and now looks as though he will be picking up a TIF after the Dutch striker scored another three goals. This time during a 4-0 home win for Sporting. It looks like the big striker has found the form which he made his name with during his Wolfsburg days.
Reserves
Alcala - CB - OVR 71
Unlike last week the silver defenders didn't have a stupidly high standard but one did stand out. That was Alcala after he scored both Girona goals and kept a clean sheet in their 2-0 win.
Almog Cohen - CM - OVR 71
Cohen picked up Bundesliga POTW during the 1st set of fixtures played after he scored a brace for Ingolstadt. He then added to that with a goal and assist at the weekend. Despite the midfielder not picking up a hat trick and being silver I still feel that he has a high chance of making the cut.
Ezgjan Alioski - ST - OVR 63
The first of three hat tricks selected for the reserves is Alioski who scored three of Lugano's four goals in their 4-2 win. There were also a couple of mid-week hat tricks but I have decided to leave them out for the most part.
Ricky Van Wolfswinkel - ST - OVR 73
There are a whole bunch of players from the Dutch division which can quite easily make the cut however I am sure that we will see no more than two or three at a huge push. Wolfswinkel was another who found the net three times to help his side to a 4-2 home win
Shinzo Koroki - ST - OVR 73
We have not seen many J-League IF's this year despite it being a new league. It now looks set for back to back IF's though after Koroki scored three and assisted another in a huge 7-0 win."

Following the shuttering of online services in January for FIFA 13 for iOS and FIFA 14 for mobile, some more server closures are on the way.
Whilst the closure of online services will mostly effect mobile players, there are also closures coming for earlier FIFAs on Xbox 360, Playstation 3, PC, PS Vita and even the Wii U. Here's the full list of closures:
May 10th 2017

FIFA Soccer 13 for PC, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, WiiU, Xbox 360
FIFA 13 Ultimate Team for PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

EA were originally going to kill off the FIFA 12 servers in 2014 but quickly U-turned on the idea, now sadly it seems like the time really has come, along with FIFA 13.
The site EA uses to publicise server closures states that they don't take the decision to turn off servers lightly, so it's likely caused by the cost of maintaining legacy services and a dwindling player base. Regardless, it's still sad to see it go, so if you've got any business to take care of in FIFA 12 or FIFA 13, you'd better get it done soon."

                        Quite a difficult side to select but with Messi, Sokratis, Kompany and ADM making an appearance it could be a decent one!
                    

Last week's score 12/23
Formation 3421 Squad Link: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/5846456/

Goalkeeper
Kevin Trapp - GK - OVR 83
Last week saw a keeper with an 8/10 miss out from Ligue 1 however that was a far less desirable IF than that of Trapp. The German stopper is highly unlikely to miss out after his 8 which he got for 4 saves in a 2-0 win over Angers
Defenders
Vincent Kompany - CB - OVR 86
Kompany has been very unfortunate the past couple of seasons due to injury. This has resulted in the Belgian having very little game time. He made a return to action on Saturday and bounced back with a goal in their 3-0 away win over Southampton
Francesco Acerbi - CB - OVR 81
Gold and Serie A options are not two things which went together for selecting this side. Acerbi is arguably the only real option for it and thus gets my nod. The Italian scored the winning goal in Sassuolo's 2-1 win.
Sokratis - CB - OVR 85
Quite a few Bundesliga options this week although most come from lesser quality players. Sokratis would be one of the main players should he make the cut though and he stands a good chance after scoring a superb goal in Dortmund's 3-1 home win claiming MOTM with a Kicker mark of 2
Midfielders
Yannick Carrasco - LM - OVR 84
Another comfortable win to nil for Atletico came and once again Felipe Luis was in the goals. I have not opted for the Brazilian but Carrasco who scored the other two in their 3-0 win. With Luis recently being included in paves the way for Yannick's second IF.
Ander Herrera - CM - OVR 83
Is the title race now back on? Tottenham will certainly think so after Man U took three points courtesy of a 2-0 win. Herrera was the main man scoring one and assisting the other both of which were superb from the Spaniard.
Florian Thauvin - RW - OVR 81
Thauvin's impressive season continued with another two goals and an assist to his name during Marseille's 4-0 win over St Etienne. He picked up POTW in France with an 8/10 and with a TIF on the way his inevitable TOTS look like one to look out for!
Lionel Messi - CAM - OVR 93
Messi has been snubbed time after time however EA finally broke the seal and gave him an IF in a rather unexpected week. Due to that I feel as though he can get in once again in a week with not many world class names available to select. He scored twice and assisted another for Barcelona as they managed a 3-2 away win over Gijon.
Angel Di Maria - RW - OVR 87
The second player from PSG I have selected is Di Maria. Although the Argentine was not MOTM he still played a huge part in their win scoring both goals in a previously mentioned 2-0 win. The big name factor alongside the fact there was a lack of options could well see him included.
Forwards
Quincy Promes - ST - OVR 81
One of the biggest games in the RPL happened this weekend and it was Spartak Moscow who came out on top winning the match narrowly by two goals to one. Promes was involved in both picking up a goal and assist which although is often not enough for a ST in the circumstances I can see him getting the nod.
Jonas - ST - OVR 84
There was a severe lack of gold striker options and thus a Jonas brace could easily be enough to see him make the cut. He scored two of Benfica's three goals in a 3-0 win, the other of which came in the form of an OG. He picked up MOTM in the process which could see him pick up a SIF.
Substitutes
Michael Esser - GK - OVR 69
Bundesliga keeper and player of the week came for Esser after an inspired performance from the German keeper saw him pick up a perfect 1. Esser made a total of seven saves as Darmstadt managed a narrow 2-1 win over Schalke.
Luisinho - LB - OVR 75
A lack of defenders once again appeared to be the main problem in selecting the side and thus we have the punt of Luisinho. The Deportivo LB assisted one of their two goals in a 2-0 home win over Malaga.
Jean Michael Seri - CM - OVR 80
Seri has been on the fringe of TOTW multiple times without receiving one or even making my prediction. This time he is almost a certainty though after he scored twice for Nice during a 3-1 win. He picked up an 8/10 from L'equipe which was the joint highest this week.
Muniain - LM - OVR 78
Bilbao had a convincing 5-1 home win over Las Palmas from which we have two potential players from. The first of which is Aduriz who found the net twice. As you can see I have opted for his team mate Munian who likewise scored twice. Both claimed 3 from Marca however Munian was officially MOTM.
Kerem Demirbay - CM - OVR 76
Hoffenheim played out an eight-goal thriller of which they came away as 5-3 winners in. Both Demirbay and Szalai scored two in the match but seeing as though Demirbay plays further back and was voted as the official MOTM I can see him getting the nod.
Jorginho - CM - OVR 81
Another punt now with Jorginho who only picked up an assist but managed a 7.5 match rating in the process during Napoli's 3-0 win over Udinese. With the lack of Serie A options this could well result in Jorginho having some preference.
Max Kruse - ST - OVR 80
I have already mentioned the lack of gold striker options and so we have yet another with a goal and assist to his name in Kruse. The Bremen striker was involved in both their goals as they managed a 2-1 win over Hamburg.
Reserves
Nigel Hasselbaink - LW - OVR 66
Usually when you see a silver with just one goal to his name you would write him off instantly, especially while the main leagues are playing. I am still taking the punt here though after Hasslebaink picked up an impressive 8.5 match rating which saw him pick up POTW.
Joao Pedro - CAM - OVR 73
There were very few options in terms of Serie A this week but one player who performed came from Cagliari in their 4-0 win over Chievo.  The Brazilian picked up two goals and an assist to claim the best mark from Gazzetta for the game-week with an 8/10
Nick Powell - CAM - OVR 70
Powell comes from a mid-week fixture and came off the bench in what I believe was a CAM role however he could well be ST. Either way he deserves his spot in the side after coming on with Wigan trailing 2-0 before scoring three goals to allow his side to take all three points.
Ohi Omoijuanfo - ST - OVR 66
Two hat tricks in three weeks now for Ohi who although could well miss out for that sole reason makes my side with the lack of alternate options available to us. Another 9/10 match rating for the Norwegian who should be picking up a 74-rated item come Wednesday.
Marcos Riquelme - ST - OVR 70
A player who without a doubt will be making the side is Riquelme after the Argentine was involved in four goals with three of his own and an assist as Audax went on to win 5-2."

                        Welcome to my weekly Ones to Watch update and analysis! I’ve combed through the schedules of all the players with OTW items and organized their game times and likelihood of starting into a handy spreadsheet.
                    

OTW Weekend is brought to you by @GummiFifa!
It is fair to say that Ones to Watch items have been a major hit in FIFA 17. In particular, the trading and investing community has taken to these cards because of the relative ease at which you can earn coins by trading with them. We have seen many investors earn millions off of well-timed OTW trades!
I’ve prepared OTW list for the weekend of 7-10th April to help you trade this weekend. Keep in mind, although some players are likely to start, I can obviously not guarantee that they will start. Predictions are taken from Whoscored.com
Players that have been in form lately:
Leroy Sané: Has been outstanding the last 2 months. Took a while to adapt to the Premier League but has been scoring and assisting a lot lately. 
Mamadou Sakho: Crystal Palace just can’t stop winning when he is in the defence. Has been crucial since he came on loan. 
M'Baye Niang: Always in the starting lineup and has been efficient to score and assist lately. 
N’Golo Kanté: Is one of the most valuable player in the Chelsea team. Been unstoppable for them and always performs. 
Alvaro Morata: Although he is not predicted to start vs Atletico Madrid he always scores when he gets a chance. Scoring a hattrick on Wednesday shows you should not underestimate him.
Memphis Depay: After an unsuccessful stay at Manchester United he went to Lyon. He looks like to be a newborn in the Lyon shirt and has been in great form lately and has already gotten 2 In-Forms in FUT.
Gonzalo Higuain: Higuain just can’t stop scoring. Always In the starting lineup and nearly scores every game.
Eric Bailly: Has been performing well lately and has been on the line to get into the TOTW few times. One fact about Bailly: He has never scored a goal in his senior career.
Dimitri Payet: Takes nearly every set piece on the field and has been stepping up lately after joining Marseille. Keep an eye on him.
Gerard Deulofeu: Although he doesn’t score a lot he has been starting nearly every game since he came to AC Milan in January. Only matter of a time he will score and be a candidate for the TOTW.
Julian Draxler: Has been playing well lately for PSG. He always delivers when he gets play time. Has been scoring lately for PSG and is a crucial player for the team in the title race. 

How to Trade with OTW Players
So, now that I’ve peaked your curiosity, I’m sure you are wondering how exactly to trade with OTW cards. There are two main methods that have proven to work every single week.
This first method is to take advantage of bad performances. When a player performs badly (a main indicator is the team losing or the player earning a poor whoscored match rating) his price tends to drop after the game, presumably because many investors and casual players panic sell the card. This provides an opportune window to pick the card up for cheap. Then, throughout the week, his price will slowly rise until game day. While it may be tempting to hold the player until he earns an inform, remembering the pattern from last week, we will want to sell the player on before the next game actually starts (a good time to sell is usually when he is announced in the starting lineup). The reason why we do that is because if he doesn’t perform well in the first 30-45 minutes his price will start to drop as it did the week prior. This is called selling in the hype.
The second method is more profitable but requires more attention. What you have to do is either watch the game that the OTW is playing or you have notifications turned on, on your phone or computer, that notify you straight away when there is a goal. If a OTW player scores in the game his price will skyrocket. However, picking up the player is not easy and you have to be quick. The time frame to pick up a player when he scores is constantly becoming smaller. At this stage in the game, you have around 20 seconds to pick up the player before your room for profit is gone. After these 20 seconds, his price will have already inflated and he won’t be worth picking up.
Trading with OTW players has never been as popular as it is now. This is not only going to make you profit, but it is also entertaining! The key is selling into the hype and not getting caught holding a card too long because of greed. Slow, steady profits will win the race in the long run."

                        Futhead News predicts the gameplay changes which could be coming to FIFA 18!
                    

It's officially approaching the time of year when ‘new FIFA’ news begins to hit our screens, and historically speaking it’s always been gameplay which leads the charge in EA's opening gambit. So after painstakingly reviewing (googling) the last few years of gameplay features added to the game, Futhead predicts the things we think will be a part of that all important FIFA 18 reveal. 
You guys do love a good prediction after all...
More Frostbite
It kind of goes without saying that EA will look to build upon the foundations of their previous release, (10/10 Dave) but nowhere will that bland obviousness be proved more right than with the Frostbite engine, which will almost certainly be front and centre of FIFA 18's marketing. EA love nothing more than to show off their latest tech so expect to see significant visual enhancements to the football environments we enjoy playing in. 
Over the years EA have added moving corner flags, fully animated benches, touchline managers, magic spray and countless other fine details which all come together to make the virtual world we play in believable. But how this particular prediction plays out may depend on any new license deals EA have managed to agree. If La Liga for example was to follow the current Premier League model of visual awesomeness, we could be set for a Mediterranean feast for the eyes. Think the Revista De La Liga set but better, and without Guillem. 
License conjecture aside, one thing certain to change will be the recreation of the newly approved single player kick-offs, which no longer require the ball to be played forwards before it can go backwards. If EA fail to implement that, i'll eat my Futhead hat. 
More Dribbling
No Touch Dribbling, True Player Motion, Precision Movement, Elite Technique. If you can think of a buzzword to attach to the art of virtual football players moving with the ball, EA have done it. And therefore it’s pretty much a guarantee we’ll see more new additions to the way players traverse the pitch at speed in FIFA 18. 
Personally I’ve never really gotten to grips with the latest of that bunch (No Touch Dribble) because I just don’t see the value it adds compared to the other, more powerful dribble mechanics. That said, there’s still plenty room for improvement in this area. As the modern game continues to give birth to more and more pacey, young, dribbling attackers, replicating these iconic 1v1 battles becomes infinitely more important for FIFA to represent. And that fact alone I think will continue to drive the development of dribble technology. 
At the moment many of the dribble/tackle situations in FIFA 17 are an instantaneous event, over in mere seconds, rather than being more of a cat and mouse duel. Any changes to dibbling would have to go hand in hand with new jockeying mechanics too, as jockeying in FIFA is a fairly one dimensional event itself at present. Balancing attack versus defence has always been a challenge for EA, and one without the other in this example, simply wouldn't work.

So do not be surprised to see Elite Dribble Precision, True Player Technique or similar in the FIFA 18 reveal. 
More Artificial Intelligence
Another consistent trend to recent FIFA gameplay reveals comes in the form of player AI, which after being neglected for many years, finally has a fitting degree of prominence in EA's priority list. Since the turn of next-gen consoles we’ve seen Attacking Intelligence, Pro Instincts, Emotional Intelligence and Control the Midfield all come to fruition under EA’s generalised vision to improve 'Innovation Across the Pitch'. 
In isolation some of these features can seem fairly small, but as a collective they are finally starting to come together to make FIFA’s cast of AI controlled team mates behave more realistically. It’s not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, and that’s why I think EA will continue to add value in this area to maintain the momentum they've built behind improving player behaviours.

So those are the three things we predict will definitely, maybe happen, but with our dreaming hats on, what else would we like to see in FIFA 18? 
Dynamic Weather
It’s been rumoured for years now, and if there’s a time to finally implement dynamic weather in FIFA, it’s now! If EA do go down this path, it’s something they need to be very careful with because no one (and I mean no one) wants dramatic shifts in weather each and every game. But if EA can apply dynamic weather with a light touch, it could be game changing for the immersion and atmosphere of matches.  How great would it be to see to see the light changing as the sun moves, or as clouds naturally obstruct it? The potential for screenshot eye candy alone is massive.

There are also issues with particular stadiums in the game which are universally disliked (San Siro) due to the harsh shadows cast by the structure of the ground, which can make playing with certain kits challenging. If there was a system which subtlety altered blazing sunshine to cloudy over the course of the 90 minutes, that transition alone would make playing on these grounds a bit more viable, as any lighting contrasts may not be present for the duration of the match. 
As I said at the start, EA would have to be ultra-careful to get this right, and provide suitable options to turn it off for competitive play. For those willing however to experience a more varied in-game look and feel, dynamic weather could be the last piece of the FIFA visual jigsaw. More work would also have to go into the physics behind weather, ie ball travel in the rain, skidding, etc but there's massive untapped potential here no doubt. 
Team Tactics
EA have made lots of changes to player AI as I’ve mentioned, but one area of massive neglect has always been team tactics. If you've played FIFA as long as I have you’ll know that many of the sliders, and options available have been largely the same for almost ten years. To give EA credit we did get new options for individual player roles as part of the Team Management UI refresh, but that foundation has yet to be built on, and at times you can struggle to feel the impact of the changes you’ve made. 
With the arrival of Conte, Mourinho, Guardiola, Pochettino and Klopp to the Premier League over the last few years, the tactical side of the modern game is now more influential than it’s ever been. With systems, and philosophies (shout-out to LVG) now front and centre of the way every team sets itself up, even on those rainy nights in Stoke. In fact, you could make the same argument for any of the top leagues in the world, and therefore FIFA should be moving towards incorporating more tactical elements into FIFA 18, and beyond.

I don’t think FIFA needs the tactical detail and intricacy of say a Football Manager game, but it should have more options for players to insert their own style than it currently supports. At the very least it would give FIFA’s gameplay a different twist to the current meta, which revolves mostly around the best use of the controller, and not always the best use of the football brain. Certainly for people who enjoy the longevity of Career Mode, this is an absolute must for FIFA 18. 
So what do you think we'll see in the FIFA 18 reveal when it happens? And which gameplay feature do you wish FIFA 18 had that it doesn't?

For the first time, EA Sports FIFA is coming to the Nintendo Switch. 
Players will be able to take a console version of FIFA on the go this year, adding to even more ways to get your FIFA fix when you’re away from your TV.
During FUT LIVE, EA announced that FIFA 18 on the Switch will have FUT and will update throughout the season like on the other major consoles. Being able to play FUT on the go and play matches online over Wi-Fi and mobile hotspots is an absolute gamechanger.
Being able to use the Switch’s touchscreen for SBC’s, squad tinkering, and searching the transfer market will bring FIFA even closer to your fingertips than before.
They revealed a bit of FIFA 18 gameplay on the Switch and mentioned that it will run at 720p on the handheld screen, but will run at 1080p when docked and displaying on your television. It’s certainly not a glorified FIFA Mobile or companion app for FUT, but it’s also not the same experience that players on PS4 and Xbox One will get.
Check out the gameplay below:

FIFA 18 will introduce a brand new mode into Ultimate Team aimed at those unable or unwilling to participate in the grind that is FUT Champions. Squad Battles is a new competitive single-player mode that will allow you to challenge pre-determined squads against FIFA 18's vastly-improved AI. These won't all be just ordinary squads, however. Some will be squads created by real life footballers or influencers in the community. 
Similar to FUT Champions, each win will net you a certain amount of points that will rank you in a rewards tier. The amount of points you receive per win will be determined by the difficulty you choose and the skill and chemistry level of the opposing squad. 
For a lot of users, 40 matches a week is simply too much of a task to commit to during a weekend or they simply are unable to win the weekly qualifying tournament. This mode is targetted to that sector of the community to have an outlet to play competitive FUT without the rigors or stress of The Weekend League.
A lot of folks who don't enjoy single player may be in for a pleasant surprise. Early reviews of those fortunate enough to have played FIFA 18 confirm the AI's been completely overhauled, designed with an eye on making gameplay more dynamic and feel more like you're playing a human.
Who knows, if you're too busy (or hey, maybe don't have the chops) to get Gold 3 or higher in FUT Champions, this might be a welcome change of pace for you."

With FIFA Mobile's Easter event running for only another 4 days and the Blue Star event steadily ticking away in the background, it's time for another program. This time, a league specific program, focussing on La Liga.
The plan starts today (April 20th) and is due to run until the 1st of May, bringing 8 new upgradable players into the mix.
 
Each of the 8 featured clubs has 4  Elite players to pick up, which you can trade, along with other items picked up from live events and packs, for a 90+ OVR Maestro player from that club that will also offer a stat boost to all other La Liga players in your squad.
On top of that, there's 8 boosted Maestro players, which come with a slight catch, they're random. So you could potentially finish the Barcelona plan and try to use your 93 rated Neymar to upgrade to the 97 rated Neymar, and receive 94 rated Rossi instead...
Whilst they're all untradeable during the event, once the event is finished, the upgraded 94-97 rated items will be available to buy or sell on the market.
So basically, if you're still hung up on FIFA Mobile and thought you'd take a little break after the disastrously received (and subsequently updated) Easter plan, you're not getting away just yet. You addict."

                        Welcome to my weekly Ones to Watch update and analysis! I’ve combed through the schedules of all the players with OTW items and organized their game times and likelihood of starting into a handy spreadsheet.

It is fair to say that Ones to Watch items have been a major hit in FIFA 17. In particular, the trading and investing community has taken to these cards because of the relative ease at which you can earn coins by trading with them. We have seen many investors earn millions off of well-timed OTW trades!
I’ve prepared OTW list for the weekend of 14-17th April to help you trade this weekend. Keep in mind, although some players are likely to start, I can obviously not guarantee that they will start. 
I’ve also added in two need features that should help you! I’ve named few players that have been in form lately and are likely to perform this week. I’ve also prepared an Injury update that I will update every week to inform you who is injured, for how long etc. Should make it a lot easier for you to trade with. 
Predictions are taken from Whoscored.com.
Players that have been in form lately
Ousmane Dembele: Been playing tremendously lately and I would keep a close eye to him in the next few weeks. 
Leroy Sané: Has been outstanding the last 2 months. Took a while to adapt to the Premier League but has been scoring and assisting a lot lately. 
M'Baye Niang: Always in the starting lineup and has been efficient to score and assist lately. 
N’Golo Kanté: I think it is fair to say he could be the player of the season in the Premier League. I think that is all I need to say about him. Always performs. 
Memphis Depay: After an unsuccessful stay at Manchester United he went to Lyon. He looks like to be a newborn in the Lyon shirt and has been in great form lately and has already gotten 2 In-Forms in FUT. This week Lyon are playing against SC Bastia which is currently in the last place in France. 
Gonzalo Higuain: Higuain just can’t stop scoring. Always In the starting lineup and nearly scores every game. 
Gerard Deulofeu: Scored in last game. This weekend AC Milan is facing Inter and that is a big rival match. Tremendous performances in rival matches often leads to a spot in the TOTW. He has been playing very well lately and scored last weekend. 
Jese: Scored and assisted in last game. Good performance in next game could give him a seat in the next TOTW 
Mamadou Sakho: Crystal Palace just can’t stop winning when he is in the defence. Has been crucial since he came on loan. 
Injury updates
Roberto Gagliardini (Inter Milan): Missed the last game due an injury. Nothing serious and the player only sprained his ankle. Should be back for this weeks game vs AC Milan.
Paul Ntep (Wolfsburg): Has missed 7 games due to an injury. Very bad injury as he has torn muscle bundle. Expected to return around 10. May 2017. 
Patrick Van Aanholt (Crystal Palace): Has been injured lately and missed few games. Has been dealing with a malleolar injury. He is a doubt for this weekend. 
Gabriel Jesus (Manchester City): Has been injured for a long time but has started training. He suffered a fractured metatarsal. Could return to the field before the end of the season. 
Mats Hummels (Bayern Munich): Missed the game vs Real Madrid due to ankle injury. Will also miss the next game this weekend. The extent of the injury is unknown. Hopefully he won’t be ruled out for a long time. 
Manolo Gabbiadini (Southampton): Should be back this weekend but is unlikely to start. After missing the last 4 games he is expected to be back this weekend. 
Sadio Mané (Liverpool): Out for the season
Luiz Adriano (Spartak Moscow): Is a doubt for the game this weekend vs Zenit. Suffered a minor injury last game. 
Breel Embolo (Schalke): Has been injured since October. He is expected to be fit before the end of the season.

So, now that I’ve peaked your curiosity, I’m sure you are wondering how exactly to trade with OTW cards. There are two main methods that have proven to work every single week.
This first method is to take advantage of bad performances. When a player performs badly (a main indicator is the team losing or the player earning a poor whoscored match rating) his price tends to drop after the game, presumably because many investors and casual players panic sell the card. This provides an opportune window to pick the card up for cheap. Then, throughout the week, his price will slowly rise until game day. While it may be tempting to hold the player until he earns an inform, remembering the pattern from last week, we will want to sell the player on before the next game actually starts (a good time to sell is usually when he is announced in the starting lineup). The reason why we do that is because if he doesn’t perform well in the first 30-45 minutes his price will start to drop as it did the week prior. This is called selling in the hype.
The second method is more profitable but requires more attention. What you have to do is either watch the game that the OTW is playing or you have notifications turned on, on your phone or computer, that notify you straight away when there is a goal. If a OTW player scores in the game his price will skyrocket. However, picking up the player is not easy and you have to be quick. The time frame to pick up a player when he scores is constantly becoming smaller. At this stage in the game, you have around 20 seconds to pick up the player before your room for profit is gone. After these 20 seconds, his price will have already inflated and he won’t be worth picking up.
Trading with OTW players has never been as popular as it is now. This is not only going to make you profit, but it is also entertaining! The key is selling into the hype and not getting caught holding a card too long because of greed. Slow, steady profits will win the race in the long run.
Best of luck!

                        Welcome to my weekly Ones to Watch update and analysis! I’ve combed through the schedules of all the players with OTW items and organized their game times and likelihood of starting into a handy spreadsheet.
                    

It is fair to say that Ones to Watch items have been a major hit in FIFA 17. In particular, the trading and investing community has taken to these cards because of the relative ease at which you can earn coins by trading with them. We have seen many investors earn millions off of well-timed OTW trades!
I’ve prepared OTW list for the weekend of 21-24th April to help you trade this weekend. Keep in mind, although some players are likely to start, I can obviously not guarantee that they will start. I’ve also added in two need features that should help you; I’ve named few players that have been in form lately and are likely to perform this week, and also prepared an Injury update that I will update every week to inform you who is injured, for how long etc. Should make it a lot easier for you to trade with. 
Predictions are taken from Whoscored.com.
Players that have been in form lately
Ousmane Dembele: Didn’t start vs Monaco in the Champions League but when he was subbed on it clearly showed how important he is for the team. 
M'Baye Niang: Always in the starting lineup and has been efficient to score and assist lately. 
Gonzalo Higuain: Higuain just can’t stop scoring. Always In the starting lineup and nearly scores every game. 
Gerard Deulofeu: Always in the starting lineup. Has been tremendous after he came to AC Milan. Keep an eye on his game. 
Jese: Has been performing lately and you should keep an eye on him. 
Alvaro Morata: Although he is not predicted to start vs Barcelona you should always keep an eye on him when he is playing. Scores every time he gets some playtime. 
Injury updates
Paul Ntep (Wolfsburg): Has missed 8 games due to an injury. Very bad injury as he has torn muscle bundle. Expected to return around 10. May 2017. 
Patrick Van Aanholt (Crystal Palace): Came back last game and was subbed on. Is expected to start vs Liverpool this weekend which means he should be fully recovered. 
Gabriel Jesus (Manchester City): Has been injured for a long time but has started training. He suffered a fractured metatarsal. Could return to the field before the end of the season. 
Mats Hummels (Bayern Munich): Played the game vs Real Madrid in the Champions League this week. Suffered a minor foot injury in the game and is a doubt for the game this weekend. 
Manolo Gabbiadini (Southampton): He is back after being on the sideline for 3 weeks. Will most likely start the game vs Chelsea on Tuesday. 
Sadio Mané (Liverpool): Out for the season
Luiz Adriano (Spartak Moscow): He is still undergoing treatment for his injury and is a doubt for the game vs Rostov. 
Breel Embolo (Schalke): Has been injured since October. He is expected to be fit before the end of the season. 
Julian Draxler (PSG): Picked up an injury is last game and will not be playing this weekend. I haven’t got any information about how long he will be ruled out. 
Hatem Ben Arfa (PSG): He is still recovering from a rib problem and will not be able to play this weekend.

After a raft of feedback regarding FUT Champions rewards from the community over the last few months, EA SPORTS have today revealed an all new reward distribution model which see's a tiered approach applied to the way those all important packs are dished out. 
The below infographic shows you pretty much everything you need to know but as you can see, the new model will see greater rewards for each and every FUT Champs tier, rather than the previous appraoch which saw packs grouped across multiple tiers. This means, if you can scrape your way up just one more reward bracket, you'll get more for it (deservedly so). 
This should mean there's greater incentive to keep playing FUT Champions even if you have a rough start because you can still acheive something greater even if you find yourself stuck in Silver. 

This new model starts on April 13th for the March rewards.

                        Headlining in week 32 we have Bonucci, Matuidi, Martial and Messi 
                    

Last week's score: 17/23
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad link :http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/5975570/

Goalkeeper
Rune Almenning Jarstein - GK - OVR 80
Although there were a few stand out options in terms of goalkeepers the main one was actually very hard to select. I opted for Jarstein in the end who although only made two saves picked up a 1.5 match rating to continue his good form during a 1-0 win over Wolfsburg.
Defenders
Leonardo Bonucci - CB - OVR 87
One of the main players comes in defence with Bonucci after he scored one of Juventus's four goals in a comfortable 4-0 win over Genoa. The goal is well worth a watch if you haven’t seen it already with the Italian running past two from his own half before scoring from 25 yards.
Raul - CB - OVR 75
It's always good to see a gold CB score twice and that is exactly what happened with Raul as he scored twice alongside keeping a clean sheet for Maritimo in their 3-0 win.
De La Bella - LB - OVR 76
The quality of defensive options was ridiculously high for once so instead of it being the usual ST selections being straight forward it was the opposite way around. De La Bella was another who scored twice and kept a clean sheet, coming in a 5-0 home win for Olympiakos.
Midfielders
Marco Fabian - CM - OVR 78
A very centrally selected midfield makes up the starting 11 starting with Fabian. The Mexican midfielder scored twice for Frankfurt as they came from behind to win 3-1 at home to Augsburg
Blaise Matuidi - CM - OVR 86
Despite this match being played on a Tuesday which is always dodgy I expect Matuidi to make the cut largely down to the side he plays for. PSG often get favourable treatment and with Matuidi scoring twice there is no reason as to why he doesn't deserve to make the side.
Ganso - CAM - OVR 81
The BBVA offered very few options but those that it did are next to nailed on. Ganso is one of those after he scored both Sevilla goals in a 2-0 win over Granada. The Brazilian picked up 3 Marca by doing so and thus walks into the side.
Lionel Messi - CAM - OVR 93
The biggest game of the weekend came with the El Classico and once again it was a big-name player deciding the match. Messi continually gets snubbed by EA for reasons which are obvious to the naked eye but surely this time for a brace against Real Madrid which includes his 500th goal for the club will see him included. Barca went on to win the match 3-2 with Messi claiming headlines once again.
Forwards
Mauro Icardi - ST - OVR 84
Now I know that Inter lost the match but as we have seen before hat tricks from the losing side often make the cut. Seeing as Icardi scored three of the four Inter goals in the previously mentioned 504 loss he falls into that category and thus makes my prediction.
Keita Balde Diao - ST - OVR 80
Lazio raced away to a 4-0 lead after just 26 minutes on the clock and although they obviously didn't keep that pace up a 6-2 win is still a very impressive score. Several players performed during the match but with Keita managing a hat trick I feel as though he will be the player included.
Christian Benteke - ST - OVR 81
Benteke and Palace are well and truly back. At one stage, it looked as though Palace were set for a real relegation battle but they have picked up some superb form which competes with the best in the league, especially considering their fixtures. Benteke was once again behind the win scoring both goals as they managed a 2-1 win over Liverpool.
Substitutes
Igor Akinfeev - GK - OVR 80
Akinfeev has picked up an IF every year in FIFA thus far and he looks to continue that trend after his performance in CSKA's 2-0 win. The keeper made four saves and saved a penalty which saw him pick up a huge match rating of 9/10.
Tony McMahon - RB - OVR 60
Continuing the trend of a brace and a clean sheet for defenders we have McMahon who managed it during a 3-0 win for Bradford over Wimbledon.
Caio - LM - OVR 75
The fact that Caio is a gold helps him massively with just the one difference in rating moving him from a fringe player to almost a certainty. The Brazilian scored twice and assisted another for Grasshopper as they managed a 4-1 win over Luzern.
Naranjo - LM - OVR 75
Genk continued their 100% record in their Europa league play-off group with a convincing 6-0 win over Mouscron. Naranjo scored half of those goals and thus walks into the side.
Matias Vecino - CM - OVR 77
A bit of a crazy match between two of the big guns in the division saw Fiorentina manage a 5-4 win over Inter. There will be at least one IF from this match if not more and honestly that is a ridiculously difficult call to make. Vecino on paper looks good with 2 goals and an assist but there are several other options.
Anthony Martial - ST - OVR 82
This one’s a bit of a punt seeing as Martial only picked up a goal and assist in a 2-0 win for United. There was a severe lack of BPL options though and with Martial being a big name in the BPL for a big club that bias could well carry him in.
Max Kruse - ST - OVR 80
Kruse picked up Bundesliga POTW thanks to the four goals he scored in a 4-2 away win over Ingolstadt. He narrowly missed out last week with a goal and assist but there is no question over his inclusion this time around.
Reserves
Vana - GK - OVR 68
It's often a case of not seeing silver/bronze keepers in TOTW anymore but with Vana putting in a superb performance against Porto it becomes increasingly difficult to ignore him. In total, he made 8 saves and claimed a 9/10 match rating in the process during his sides 0-0 draw. 
Angelo Fulgini- CAM - OVR 66
I can't remember the last time Ligue 2 picked up an IF nor when I predicted them to do so. Fulgini will be breaking both of those routs after he scored a hat trick from midfield during his sides 4-0 home win.
Jimmy Cabot - LM - OVR 73
Cabot picked up Ligue 1's POTW with a huge match rating of 9/10. It's hard to argue against that after the winger added both two goals and two assists to his name during Lorient's 5-1 win.
Richard Sukuta Pasu - ST - OVR 67
Pasu picked up POTW in the second tier of Germany with a perfect 1 mark after scoring twice and assisting another in his sides comfortable 4-0 win.
Sebastian Giovinco - ST - OVR 83
There were no silver or bronze hat tricks to select this week and thus I am taking the punt on another gold option in Giovinco. The Italian has impressed ever since moving to the MLS and managed to add another two goals to his tally this weekend"

With everyone chasing Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, we'll zig where they're zagging and look today at the End of an Era SBC Philipp Lahm.

There can be little question that Lahm was one of the greatest players of his era, and one of the greatest to ever play the game. A consumate professional, he won everything that could be won in a 16 year career with Bayern Munich (he spent two of those years at Stuttgart) and the German national team. Lahm was a player whose technique flawless, and whose ability to read the game was unmatched. Therefore, it is only fitting that he has received this 95-rated item to commemorate his career -- not only is it the best RB in FIFA 17, it is possibly the best RB item in the history of FIFA. Oh, and the SBC you need to complete to unlock him (which is available for the remainder of the game) is pretty affordable.
In-game stats and rating
This item has some truly ridiculous stats. With the exception of 74 shooting (he has 85 long shots, 87 volleys, 93 penalties and 91 positioning, so it's not at all bad), he has 85+ item stats. His 89 pace is a significant boost on his 94-rated TOTS item, making this item far more usable. Where he really shines is in his passing, dribbling and defending - between these three stats, he has 15 90+ in-game stats, of which eight are 99. All this is without taking into account his 99 stamina, 95 jumping, 78 strength and 77 aggression.

Since his defending stats are virtually perfect, I decided to boost his pace and physicality using a Hawk chemistry style. That may seem illogical, but his stats become truly ridiculous. He goes up to 96 pace, with 81 shooting (including 95 long shots), and 89 physical (with 83 strength and 87 acceleration).

Here are his in-game ratings with the Hawk chemistry style:

Squad
Here is one of the squads I used Lahm in: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7361072/

He played at RB 99% of the time. There was one game where I needed to take Alonso off (forgot to put a fitness item on), so he played around 45 minutes at CDM. He was unreal there (probably one of the best I have used -- on par with TOTS Kante), but this review is going to based on his performance at RB.
Stats
Here are my stats with Lahm:
Price: SBC cost me around 85K on Xbox One.
Games: 32
Goals: 5
Assists: 5
Chemistry Style: Anchor
Let's get into the review.
Review
Just like with all the other End of an Era SBC items, I'll start with the negatives. Or in Lahm's case, the negative. He only has one issue -- he's a little on the short side. But that rarely affects this item -- he still wins headers against wingers, but can get outjumped by taller strikers. However, that really only affected me once, and it didn't result in a goal.
Besides that, he's perfect in every other way.
His pace is incredible -- he feels faster than 89 pace, and definitely feels closer to the 96 pace the Hawk chemistry style gives him. I haven't had any issue with his pace, and it's an incredible asset both defensively and offensively. He'll catch up to anyone, and he'll outpace a lot of players who try to track him.
I really, really enjoyed his shooting. All of his goals were from outside the box, and they were all perfect long shots. One was hit on the volley, two on the half-volley, and two after a bit of dribbling. The number of corners this guy got me during the Weekend League was crazy -- he can pop one from distance, and the keeper is going to have to dive and parry it out.
I loved his passing. I think he's the second best passer I've used this year, behind that Xabi Alonso item. His crossing is perfect (better than Kuyt), and his passing range is absolutely ridiculous - he can pick out any person on the field with ease. He never misplaces a pass, and he's deadly if you give him a yard of space.
His dribbling is perfect. He's one the best dribblers I've used in this game. He's incredibly agile, able to turn instantly, and has perfect ball-control and dribbling. His dribbling makes him feel even quicker in-game, because he's as fast on the ball as he is off it. He can weave in and out with ease, and work his way past opponents without even trying to. It's actually ridiculous.
His physicality was suprisingly good. He feels pretty strong in game, and his aggression is superb. Stamina is perfect, so he can run all game long, and his jumping makes up for his height. It's more than enough for him to be a tank in game, and he's pretty hard to bully off the ball. Combine this with his defensive stats, and you have the best defender around.
Finally, his defending. Wow. It is sublime. He's constantly tackling and intercepting and marking and covering and pressuring - he genuinely could defend entirely on his own, and he'd still keep a clean sheet. His tackling is very unique -- he sort of floats up an opponent, and gently dispossesses them without them even knowing. His interceptions are game changing, and the best I've seen this year (even better than Kante). He's always in position to cut out a pass, even when you don't see it yourself.
Summary
This is the best RB in the game, and possibly the best RB I've ever used in any FIFA. He's unreal defensively, with perfect passing and dribbling, as well as solid pace, shooting and physicality. You're getting all that for 150-200K (if you start with nothing in your club). This is the best SBC to complete this year (yes, even better than sPOTM Son), and I cannot recommend him enough.

The end is nigh. EA Sports have announced via a in-game message that FUT Champions is officially ending its first-ever season on September 4. 

The last Weekend League of FIFA 17 will begin on Friday, September 1 and run through September 4. In preparation for FIFA 18's release, it's unclear if any daily tournaments or another substitute will be added to replace the lack of competition for three weeks. 
Nevertheless, we get set to say goodbye to a truly innovative mode that completely revitalized Ultimate Team and even the FUT market itself. Competitive FIFA was once for the elite of the elite and now it's been brought right to your console thanks to FUT Champions. We can only wait and see what they have in store for the next installment of the mode. If the first year is any indication, we won't be disappointed.
For now, enjoy your free time, go outside, repair all the broken controllers and get ready for season two."

Seasoned traders and investors will know that the early release of the web app is one of the best opportunities to make coins all year. Player prices constantly shift as market prices adjust to huge influxes of items and coins. These conditions create the perfect opportunity to earn a war chest of coins so that you can start building your competitive FUT Champs squads and get a leg up on the competition.
Release dates, new features, and account setup
Before we dive in, let's start with the basics: The official release date of the web app is set for September 21st with the companion app launching shortly after on the 22nd. EA confirmed these dates in an article on their website. Of note here is that the official EA Access date is also on the 21st. However, it is likely that players will be able to play as soon as the 20th. This will shake things up significantly for Xbox users. We'll get more into that later.
EA have also made a much requested improvement to the web app this year. They announced during their FUT Live event that the desktop web app will now have the ability to complete SBCs! Our fingers are crossed hoping that the UI is more streamlined the clunky experience on the companion app.
Finally, you'll want to make sure that your account is ready to go. Be sure to check out EA's article on how to make sure everything is in line.
How to get started
Once you've logged into the web app, if you are a returning FUT player, you'll have a number of loyalty packs waiting for you. The value of these packs will vary with how long you have been a FUT member. Long term players will receive better packs. Do your favorite good luck ritual and open those packs!
Now that you have a fair number of players and consumables in your club, it's time to start thinking about what you should sell and what to keep. As a general rule, you'll want to sell the majority of what you pack. That includes, balls, kits, stadiums, contracts, bronze keepers, and everything in between. We are looking to scrap together coins whatever way possible. As the old saying goes, ""You need money to make money.""
However, if a item is ""investment grade"" you'll want to hold onto them. These are items that we believe people will mistakenly undervalued at the start and, therefore, have the potential to rise. We'll cover what types of items those are in a later section, but if you have any specific questions that you want to run by us, feel free to ask us on Twitter.
Making Coins
Now that you have some coins to play with, it's time to layout a few strategies to help you amass your FUT fortune:
Trading Strategies
Let's first go over some trading strategies. Trading strategies take advantage of short term inefficiencies in the market while the prices of players and consumables settle. A combination of low patience and players that might not know any better often result in players and consumables popping up on the transfer market listed below their value. And that's where we come in…
Non-Rare Gold Method
Great for new FUT traders, or players who don't have much time. This strategy relies on the technique of mass bidding on ""low"" value gold items, which one then sells at higher Buy Nows. Not much risk, but steady profits make this an ideal starting option.
How it works: Set your Transfer Market filters to Gold Quality with a max price of 400 to 450. Place bids on items that have desirable stats (i.e high pace, dribbling, etc.) or play in big leagues (Premier League, La Liga, 'Calcio A', etc.). You may not win all your bids, but you will undoubtable score some sweet deals. Relist your items for a profit, but make sure to keep their Buy Now at a competitive price. Rinse and repeat.
Silver Card Method
The Silver Card trading method uses many of the same mass bidding principles as the NR Gold method; however, a FUT trader can take it to the next level by targeting specific players. This strategy is recommended for traders with at least a basic knowledge of the market, as well as have a decent supply of patience. Although there is a slight level of risk, and it can take time to find deals, this method allows traders greater flexibility with a higher possibility of scoring some major profit.
How it works:


Option 1 - Set your Transfer Market filters to Silver Quality with a max price of 300 to 350. Place bids on items that have desirable stats, or play in big leagues. Remember, you may not win all your bids. Relist your items for a profit, but make sure to keep their Buy Now competitive. Rinse and repeat.


Option 2 - Targeting specific items may require some preliminary research, or it can be picked up by identifying trends of undervalued players from Option 1. The point is to find players with desirable stats, or in big leagues that are constantly listed at low starting prices. Most deals will be picked up through Open Bids, yet be on the lookout for the rare Buy Now opportunity.


59th Minute Method
When the game first drops, there will be plenty of new and impatient players who whimsically list their extremely valuable players. This presents the perfect target for all you item snipers. You'll have to be in the right place at the right time, but the profit from this strategy can be limitless.
How it works: Focus on players high value leagues (Premier League, La Liga, 'Calcio A', etc…). Develop specific price filters by researching the player's current market price. The strategy will work best when used at popular times for packs, such as right after school (3-6 p.m.) in the UK and North America. Bonus points for creating filters that include multiple players in the same search!
Bronze Pack Method (aka BPM)
The infamous 'BPM'. This strategy might be best used if you already have a sizable coin total. There is a lot of risk in opening bronze packs at the start of FIFA 18, yet the endorphins of opening packs combined with the prospective reward make this an attractive strategy.
How it works: Open 400 coin Bronze packs. For more stable returns, you'll want to be able to open about 5-10 at a time (can be limited by transfer list size at beginning of FUT).  List every item for sale! It only takes a few items to sell to break even; however, be prepared to list items multiple times. Often items need to be listed a few times, so patience is required.
Tip: A substantial boost to the method's effectiveness comes if there is a SBC requiring bronze players. With the potential for an early league SBC, this could be something to keep an eye on.
Alternative Markets
For those hip side-stream traders, there are two other areas of the market to exploit. Often, traders get caught up in the potential glory of flipping player items for massive profits and forget about how effective consumable trading with club items and consumables can be!


Rare Kit & Badges - With a keen fashion sense, scour the market for kits and badges that catch the eye. If you don't trust your fashion instincts you may be better served heading over to the kit and badge section of Futhead and sorting by likes to see which badges, kits, and even stadiums are the most popular. Once again, you can employ mass bidding techniques once you get an idea for how much a certain item has the potential to go for.


Rare Consumable Flipping - With no games being played when the Web App first drops, many players disregard consumables. There are plenty of ripe deals on Position Modifiers, Chemistry Styles and Squad Fitness, but we'll delve deeper into this in our next section.


Investing Strategies
While trading strategies take advantage of short term inefficiencies, investing strategies take advantage of medium to long term price changes that hopefully provide larger profit margins when it comes time to sell.
Behind every investing strategy, there needs to be a good thesis and every good thesis starts with an understanding of market conditions. With that in mind, before we dive into the strategies, let's go over a number of market conditions that will likely play out at the start of FUT 18.
Market Backdrop
When developing a FUT investing thesis, there are three main factors you'll need to consider: the supply of items, the demand for items, and the supply of coins. These three factors work together to help determine market prices.
With this in mind, the early stages of the FUT market can be broken down into three broad stages.

Early Web App Start -  During this period, the only way to access the FUT market is through the web app. There are no games played and no one can load up FIFA points. This means that the supply of items is low, essentially limited to the items packed in loyalty packs and daily login bonuses. In addition, the supply of coins is low, and the demand for cheap, starter tier items is at an all time high.

Xbox players should note that they are essentially skipping this stage this year because EA Access is set to drop at the same time as the web app  (possibly before).


EA Access/Pre-Order Access - When players finally get their hands on the console version of the game, things really start to get interesting. The major shift here is that players can load up FIFA points. This leads to a huge influx in items, both upper and lower tier. As far as demand goes, most of the time, the demand for high level items actually outweighs supply as big spenders tend to quickly amass a small fortune from FIFA points and funnel that demand to the high end players. These FIFA point spenders tend to sell everything they pack in the pursuit of these small fortunes, putting downward pressure on the prices of lower/mid tier players.


Worldwide Launch - The market undergoes yet another shift when the game officially launches worldwide. The number of new, casual players eclipses the existing player base and their loyalty packs and whatever money they put into FIFA points works to push out huge volumes of items at all levels. Since most of these players are causal, their demand is skewed towards the lower tier players. This means that the mid-upper tier players tend to take a temporary hit (before rebounding in October, but we'll save that for another post), and lower tier, OP players bump up significantly.


The Strategies
Now that we have the lay of the land, so to speak, let's lay out some methods you can follow. Remember that before investing in any of these methods, it's important to have a plan for when you are going to buy and at what price point. The same goes for selling. Staying disciplined and keeping panic buying/selling at a minimum will lead to long term success.
OTW Candidate Investing
The Method: One of the most lucrative methods last year was investing in the regular golds items of OTW candidates before their gold items went out of packs while their OTW version was in packs during the first week of the game.
Thesis: This method could prove effective again this year. When the regular gold items goes out of packs, the supply of that item is put under pressure. The price of the OTW item will be price prohibitive for most, meaning their only option will be to buy a more expensive regular gold item. This works particularly well for players that are classed as OP. You can prepare your list of potential investments by checking out our OTW predictions.
TOTW 2 Candidates
The Method: Similar to the OTW candidate investing strategy, this method consists of investing in the regular gold items of TOTW 2 candidates.
Thesis: This essentially follows the same logic as the OTW investing method. When the gold item is replaced by the inform item in packs, the supply is pinched and prices usually rise.
TOTW 1 and 2 Investing
The Method: A tried and true method, investing in potential high demand TOTW 1 and 2 items has usually been a safe bet every FIFA. A note of caution, however. This method is extremely popular and may fall victim to overinvesting.
Thesis: In the beginning of the game, the supply of coins is spread thin, but the supply of high end packed IFs tends to be on the high side. This means that these early TOTW players can go for relatively reasonable prices with the potential to rise dramatically over time.
Consumable Investing
The Method: This method consists of buying valuable consumables for cheap while they are in low demand before the full release of the game, and holding them until the console versions drop. Examples of good consumables include rare squad fitnesses, injury items, and popular position change items.
Thesis: When people open their loyalty packs or FIFA point funded packs they are usually more focused on building their teams and would prefer to sell their consumables to get all the coins they can. This means that the supply is very high while demand is relatively low (since no one is playing any games). This leads to lower that normal prices that have the potential to rise dramatically when the full game drops. Prices can raise even higher when the first weekend league rolls around.
Rare Kits and Badges
The Method: Investing in highly sought after rare kits and badges can be a great and foolproof way to make a ton of coins. The key here is being patient when trying to sell. Sometimes relisting will be frustrating but eventually you will find the right buyer.
Thesis: Similar to consumable investing, when people are first opening their loyalty packs they don't necessarily consider how valuable rare kits and badges can be. They are usually more concerned about getting enough coins to scrape together a starter team. This means that hoarding rare or desirable kits and badges can yield great returns when sold at times when people first hop onto the console version of the game and they have earned a bit more spending money. A good way to identify the highly sought after kits and badges is by sorting for likes on FutHead's kits and badges page.
OP Silver and Gold Players
The Method: The method is probably the most obvious, but is often one of the toughest to pull off. Every year, there are a number of low rated players that are incredibly good in the game for whatever reason. If you can identify these players early and pick them up before they get hyped up, you'll be in the money. If you happen to catch a big influencer (YouTubers, Twitch streamers, etc.) raving about a certain player early, and you can beat the rest of the crowd to the market and pick them up, you should see solid returns.
Thesis: This method works as well as it does because the FIFA community is prone to hyping the up the ""OP-ness"" of certain players. This drives up demand and with it, their price.
Squad Building Challenges
The Method: There are a number of SBCs that could be on the way early in FIFA 18. Potential examples include the August and September POTMs and the first couple league SBCs. Be of the lookout for future guides from us as it relates to those potential SBCs.
Thesis: SBC requirements often require a specific group of players. Depending on the reward for the SBC, this can lead to significant jumps in price as pressure is put on the existing supply.

Ones To Watch are back! One of the most exciting additions to FIFA 17 is set to make its return for FIFA 18. After the Career Mode-esque record breaking transfer window we just had, a star-studded OTW lineup seems in the cards. Looking back at said transfer window, we put together our predicted lineup of OTW cards as well as short bios and general outlooks for our projected 23.

Overview, Release Dates, and Changes
Before we get into our predictions, let’s go over some Ones to Watch basics. Last year, just after launch, EA introduced 23 OTW items, describing them as cards with “dynamic ratings” whose stats increase when they earn TOTW items.
This year, during their FUT Live show, EA confirmed the release date of this year’s initial batch of OTW items for September 29 (the worldwide launch of the game) as well as confirming six of this year’s OTW items (see below). We anticipate that EA will roll out an additional 17 items on the 29th to make a full squad of 23. However, we wouldn’t put it past EA to add more given how eventful this transfer window has been.
CONFIRMED - @neymarjr  will be in the #FUT18 Ones to Watch on Sep 29! Rest of the OTW revealed closer to launch.  [rating not final] pic.twitter.com/BfexuALicX— EA SPORTS FIFA (@EASPORTSFIFA) August 4, 2017

One notable change this year, is that EA seem to be relaxing the requirement that limited OTW ratings boosts to TOTW items. During their FUT Live show they were quoted saying, ""It won't just be Team of the Weeks this year [that get upgrades]. It'll actually be a little bit more. But we don't have anything to announce today.” This opens the door to rating upgrades through different special cards such as MOTM, TOTGS, etc. 
Our predictions
Below, you’ll see our predicted lineup of 23 OTW items. We tried to model our predictions based on the cards already confirmed by EA. Per their example, the selection criteria for these special items seems more diverse this year. By adding a card like Bonucci, it shows that there is a possibility for some more experienced marquee players to receive serious consideration. We also looked to have a diverse representation from across Europe’s main leagues. Of course predictions are predictions, and we’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments or on Twitter.
Confirmed OTWs

PLAYER BREAKDOWNS
Tiemoue Bakayoko - Chelsea


Bio: A true box-to-box midfielder, the Frenchman broke onto the scene last year at AS Monaco. A high profile move to the reigning Premier League champions means he’s truly one to watch.


Outlook: Huge upside here since he will start frequently, yet don’t expect him to get to Kante’s level from last year.




Mohamed Salah - Liverpool


Bio: The Egyptian has started the season in flying form! The ex-Roma winger slots perfectly into Klopp’s Liverpool side, which should make him an exciting watch this season.



Outlook: His explosive pace coupled with his eye for goal could see him pick up a few informs, but he may fall into the trap of playing second fiddle to the likes of Mane and Coutinho. 



Benjamin Mendy - Manchester City


Bio: Another former AS Monaco star, one could argue that Mendy’s rating may be a bit unfair to the Frenchman. However, he has loads of potential and can easily punch above his 78 overall rating. 


Outlook: Will start most weeks and with a dangerous left foot expect him to pick up some assists. Potential TOTWs could be jeopardized by City’s work-in-progress defence. 



Serge Aurier - Spurs


Bio: With the departure of the pacey FUT legend Walker, Tottenham could not have found a better replacement than Aurier. The Ivorian has all the tools to thrive in the Premier League. 


Outlook: Extremely talented, but can be held back by off the field antics. If he can keep focused expect him to compete for the title of best RB in the league. 



Jordan Pickford - Everton


Bio: Dare one say the next Butland? Pickford excelled at Sunderland last season, and although they couldn’t survive the drop, a summer move to Everton has him poised for a breakout year.


Outlook: Even with all his potential, Jordan is still a young goalkeeper so he won’t be mistake free. With a high ceiling, he still presents a safer investment option. 



Javier ""Chicharito"" Hernandez - West Ham


Bio: A true poacher with plenty of Premier League experience has Hammers fans salivating over Chicharito. Mexico’s all-time leading goal scorer is only limited by the West Ham team around him. 


Outlook: Should pick up quite a few goals, but will he be on the winning side enough to rack up the upgrades and warrant an investment? 



Benedikt Howedes - Juventus


Bio: A World Cup winner, Howedes made his move to Turin on Deadline Day. Bonucci left big shoes to fill, but he is a somewhat underrated player who could prove to be a valuable signing.


Outlook: Juve have plenty of depth at the back, yet they also have plenty of fixtures. Benedikt could do well to carve out a regular spot and claim a few upgrades in the process. 



Franck Kessie - AC Milan


Bio: Twenty year old Kessie was a highlight of a busy AC Milan transfer window. The midfielder should adjust quickly to life at the San Siro, especially since his old home is a mere 50 minute train ride away. 


Outlook: Kessie seemed to fizzle out at times last season, but he has bags of potential and he already picked up an inform at the end of FIFA 17. All good signs for the future.



Kylian Mbappe - PSG


Bio: Arguably the best young talent in the world! After a move to PSG, the twenty year will join a formidable front line that includes Neymar and Cavani.   



Outlook: You can expect his season to go two ways: he will either excel in this PSG team, or the pressure to deliver may become too much and he’ll fade. So far, all signs point to the former.



Youri Tielemans - Monaco


Bio: The Belgian is a signing that seems to have gone under the radar this summer.  It’s time to show how good he is, and don’t be surprised if an even bigger club comes knocking. 


Outlook: With limited midfield competition, and natural attacking instincts, Tielemans should see a bump or two this season. But that pace...



John Anthony Brooks - Wolfsburg


Bio: An unusual move to Wolfsburg seeing how well Hertha Berlin did last season. The American is looking to play a key role in turning around an abysmal Wolfsburg side. 


Outlook: Brooks is a solid defender who can occasionally find the back of the net (just ask Ghana), but he may be let down by an out of form Wolfsburg.



Corentin Tolisso - Bayern


Bio: After a wonderful season with Lyon, and an amazing TOTS, Tolisso was snapped up by the Bavarian giants. All eyes are on him to see if he has what it takes to compete with the world's best. 


Outlook: He is truly a complete midfielder; however, he could be at risk of not playing enough. Invest with care. 



Bruma - RB Leipzig


Bio: A Free Pack Project and Air Japes alike favorite, the Portuguese man swapped Turkey for Germany at the beginning of the summer. He is surrounded by plenty of talent and should feel right at home in Saxony.



Outlook: The rapid winger should excel in this vibrant Leipzig team, so expect him to score and assist more often than not. He may prove to be a shrewd investment. 



Andriy Yarmolenko - Dortmund


Bio: Andriy is bit of a dark horse who has been scoring for fun in the Ukrainian League. He can play on the wing or behind the striker, which is ideal for the BVB attack. 


Outlook: A regular starter with five-star skills means this card is already an attractive option. If he can pick up a few upgrades to his pace he can easily become a fan favorite and FUT stable.




Ousmane Dembele - Barcelona


Bio: With talent out the wazoo, Dembele lit up the Bundesliga at Dortmund. His talent is undeniable, and giants Barcelona poached him as the successor of Neymar. 


Outlook: Like his compatriot Mbappe, the pressure may become too much and he may need time to adjust. We are not expecting as many fireworks from him this season, but regardless he’ll be heavily sought after.




Nelson Semedo - Barcelona


Bio: Barca may have finally found a replacement for Dani Alves, Semedo looks ready made for the Spanish League with his pace and technical ability. 


Outlook: Slight playing time concerns loom over the full back; however, he should have ample opportunities to prove himself. The nimble RB has all the skills necessary to surprise this season.



Ever Banega - Sevilla


Bio: The Argentine returns to La Liga where he was very good for Valencia and Sevilla before he left for Inter. He is coming off an inconsistent campaign, so expect him to play with chip on his shoulder. 


Outlook: Great technical ability has led to Banega always being an attacking threat (cough Atalanta cough), yet underlying flaws could see him flop.  




Additional Possibilities
Below we’ve put together additional OTW possibilities. While we certainly feel that some of these are more likely than others, you never know how EA will make their final selections.

                        Icon Stories, Squad Battles, new Apps, Switch, OTWs and all the new features.
                    

After a shaky technical start which comprised multiple “pre-show” introductions (to the always great displeasure of the Twitch chat), FUT LIVE finally got underway last night and once it did, the Ultimate Team news came thick and fast. So here's a recap of everything we saw: 
ICON STORIES
The biggest hitter of FUT Live was the reveal of the all new Icons Stories which will see three card variants of each Icon based around the most significant moments of their illustrious career’s. With one standout “Prime” version of each Icon set to be released at intervals throughout the season. The different Icons will also have their own unique in-game appearance based on how they looked at that point in time – a very nice touch. 
Everyone (perhaps quite rightly) cacked themselves at Henry’s LW 90 version so it was nice to have that bit of deliberate miscommunication resolved and as well as the new triple Icon model, it was great to see some brand new faces in the mix with Ronaldinho the standout most requested community addition.

I guess the thing I would have liked to have seen extra from Icon Stories was an actual story element. Perhaps an in-game scenario we could play to try and recreate one of their most famous goals, or moments? Scenario Mode was a great addition in the World Cup and Euro games, and I’d hoped it may be leveraged here to play in to the stories behind why these versions were picked?

Also it would have perhaps been nice for the “Prime” versions of each Icon card to perhaps look a bit more special in style? A different frame colour, or a slightly different texture. I don’t know; just something to make those pinnacle versions of each Icon really standout, perhaps.

SQUAD BATTLES
As someone who found FUT Champions incredibly stressful last year, Squad Battles for me is the standout new addition to Ultimate Team for FIFA 18. An offline variant of the Champs reward model was a much requested community feature, so it’s great to see EA respond to that. And even if Squad Battles are only used by the majority to mix things up when you just can’t face the Weekend League grind, the chance for players of all abilities to get those coveted monthly rewards is a really positive step forwards for FUT. 
The addition of Featured Squads is another nice touch because when your favourite YouTuber, Pro Player, or real footballer’s squads appear in Squad Battles it will undoubtedly draw people in for the bragging rights alone. But for everyone else the fact community squads are also in the spotlight could make for some really special moments for lots of FIFA gamers this year. 
How the rewards from Squad Battles are being handled is yet to be determined but expect them to be (like all offline rewards) below that of the online FUT Champions tiers. But as long as they are comparable to a degree, there will still be plenty of motivation for new and old players to tune up their skills before going online. 

CHAMPIONS CHANNEL
I’ve seen quite a lot of positive reactions to Champions Chanel which is undoubtedly a nice addition to FUT, but to be honest, I personally felt a bit underwhelmed by it. Having a selection of high-profile Top 100 matches to watch on demand as a sort of FIFA TV is a good idea as I said, but why go in-game for that if you could just as easily watch the same content on Twitch or YouTube?
It’s being positioned mostly as a learning tool for would-be FUT Champs Pro's and it will undoubtedly add value there. But actually watching an existing FIFA Pro live on Twitch and listening to their own oration of what they’re doing (and why) is infinitely more powerful than a Champions Chanel highlights reel for me personally. It’s a good addition, but I can perhaps see the novelty wearing off fast. 

NEW WEB APP AND DAILY OBJECTIVES
Yep, the Ultimate Team Web App is finally getting a revamp, and it’s long overdue. It looks great as well, and with the same style consistency across mobile, tablet and PC it will hopefully make the management of your FUT Club simple and intuitive which ever device you happen to pick-up. 
As well as that Daily Objectives are being added which are a natural evolution of the Mangers Tasks we’re all so familiar in completing as soon as the game launches. I’d personally like to see some really long term objectives added to FUT as well, but as a starting point, anything which gives you a compelling reason to fire up each day and be rewarded gets my vote.

FIFA 18 ON NINTENDO SWITCH
If you took the plunge and purchased a Nintendo Switch, then you’ll be pleased to know that the FIFA 18 version it runs will include Ultimate Team. And providing you have Wi-Fi connectivity (or the ability to tether to a smart device) you’ll be able to play matches and browse the transfer market on the go. I’m sure a lot of you use the companion app for some of that functionality already, but if you do own a Switch it’s going to open up an extra level of freedom for FUT on-the-go.
We know already that FIFA 18 on Switch uses its own custom game engine which is different to the established console Frostbite version, so from a gameplay perspective FIFA 18, Switch will very much need to be judged on its own merits. We got a very brief look at how it played during FUT Live, but it was very difficult to draw much meaningful from it. 

ONES TO WATCH
Ones to Watch are back as well and the initial reveal of players was very positive with Lukaku, Lacazette, James and Douglas Costa all confirmed as OTWs. There will of course be more players added to that list as we move towards launch, but as an opening gambit, it certainly grabbed my attention. 
EA also hinted at a slightly different model for OTW upgrades in FIFA 18 which won’t solely be based around In-Forms anymore. Details on that were a little bit sketchy during FUT Live, so we’ll need some more information from EA on exactly how that's going to work. But if nothing else, it will certainly make the ownership of OTWs even more interesting in FIFA 18 Ultimate Team. 

SUMMARY
So that was FUT Live, and overall it was a very solid mix of new content and natural evolution of existing features. The standout additions are of course Icon Stories and Squad Battles but the changes to the Web App and OTWs shouldn’t be underestimated either; accessibility and user experience are so important to the way we consume FUT content. 
The one somewhat disappointing feature for me was Champions Chanel, but only because I believe you can get the same content elsewhere with even better opportunities to learn from the best in the business. As a mode I think it's fine, I just don't quite share EA's optimism about how impactful it will be. But hey, I could be wrong?
The absence of any news on changes to FUT Draft and FUT Champions itself was also perhaps a little disappointing, but with Gamescom just 20 days away, EA will undoubtedly be keeping some big FUT reveals back for their EA conference in Germany. So I guess we’ll have to wait on see on that. But after the success of these modes last year, it would be crazy for EA to not give both Draft and Champions a touch up of some kind for FIFA 18.

""Icon Stories"" have been one of the more welcome and exciting developments to hit FIFA Ultimate Team's player pool in some time.
Taking the traditional ""Legend"" structure and evolving them in such a way to include not just one but three unique versions of each now ""Icon"", the new addition to FUT has been a widely celebrated one to say the least.
Though many of the Icons have long been known since their reveal back during FUT Live at the MLS All Star Game, we now know the rest of the Icons that'll make up the possibilities in FIFA 18 ... at least at launch.
In the video above, you can see three version of each of the 23 other as-to-yet-be announced 100% officially Icons, the two lower rated versions of which are expected to be in FUT 18 when the game launches. Because contractual situations are fluid, and the last two FIFAs have seen EA develop the ability to add as well as return players to the database after the fact, something tells me this isn't an open and shut case.
Regardless, as of the first few weeks and beyond of the new game, here's a complete list of all the FIFA 17 Legends who won't be making the transition to Icon at launch:

Ruud Van Nistelrooy

Not all of us -- heck, many of us -- have the flexibility during our weekends to get in 40 matches of FIFA Ultimate Team, much less competitive FUT.
Say hello to Squad Battles.
A more relaxed way to take on all comers and try to stake your claim as the best at something in FIFA Ultimate Team brings all the best of competitive FIFA to the single player mode.
By taking on a rotating list of squads -- some influenced by YouTubers, EA staff, community members, and actual footballers -- each week, you're able to compete for prizes that while not quite as lucrative as those FUT Champions has to offer, are still plenty enticing for grinding a dozen and change (exact amount still pending) number of matches.
All the expected rewards at launch and a general overview of how to go about getting started in the newest game mode in FUT can be found in the video up above."

For those who like to watch their favorite FUT player on Twitch or Youtube, be prepared for a whole new viewing experience. 
During FUT LIVE’s non-stop barrage of announcements, EA Sports introduced their newest FIFA 18 addition: the Champions Channel. This in-FIFA 18 game mode allows fans to watch full match replays from the best FUT players in the world's actual weekends that were.
The controls work like this: fans will be able to pause and play, change the camera, change play speed and hide the menu. These options seem limited but what else could you possibly ask for?
Below the controlled options, a timeline will appear. This map will indicate when highlights, goals, and cards from the provided match occured, allowing viewers to jump back and forth between the game’s best moments.
How do you think this new feature will impact your own gameplay being able to learn from the best of the best?

Another one? You bet.
The run on Premier League FUTTIES Winners continues, as Manchester United LB Luke Shaw took home the vote for Favourite LB. Shaw joins countrymen Chris Smalling (Favourite CB) and Jack Butland (Favourite GK) as victors so far in the FIFA 17 edition of the fan-voted awards. 
A pair of Bundesliga LM/LW's will look to stop the run on PL players in the Favourite LM/LW Futties Vote. Bayern Munich LW Kingsley Coman and Schalke 04 LM Yevhen Konoplyanka go up against Manchester City LM Raheem Sterling. With lots of pace to choose from, players should get a  pretty sweaty LM/LW option regardless of the winner -- though based on the last few weeks, it's probably a safe bet who will take home the honors on Tuesday.
You can check out the upgraded Shaw's card stats here and what his SBC will take to complete here."

UPDATE: Looks like some eleventh hour negotiatons culminated in a few extra songs beyond the presumptive final build we saw in London. Here's the new additions in a Spotify playlist you can use to listen to the full soundtrack:


One of the most exciting parts of the FIFA release cycle is finally here.
Those fortunate enough to get their hands on the FIFA 18 beta heard but a small sample of the eventual full soundtrack. Now we can all check out the songs and artists from the upcoming title's once again outstanding soundtrack.
A venerable mix of indie alternative, hip-hop, and world sounds, FIFA 18 again puts together an eclectic but accessible selection of some of the best and rising artists from across the entire globe today. Some of the names you know (and even from past FIFAs); others will soon ear-worm their way into your collective consciousness as you hear them over-and-over-and-over during the course of the next 12 months.

Another FUTTIES vote, another Premier League winner.
Manchester City's Raheem Sterling became the latest in what's turned into a long line of 2017 FIFA Ultimate Team FUTTIES winners from England's Premier League. He joins teammate Leroy Sane, Stoke City's Jack Butland, and Manchester United's Chris Smalling and Luke Shaw as upgrade pink-and-gold item recipients from arguably the most popular league in the world.
The next 72 hours' vote could be tilted towards the Prem again, with Tottenham's wantaway right midfielder Moussa Sissoko a nominee in the first truly creative category -- Position Swaps. If Sissoko wins, he'll move from RM to CM. If Roma's Alessandro Florenzi gets the nod, he'll move from RB to CM. If Basque RW Inaki Williams takes it, he'll move from RW to ST.
Who are we to tell you to who to vote for -- but Williams certainly seems the most interesting on paper.
You have until Friday to complete the voting SBCs and/or build the upgraded Sterling, if that's your bag."

After FUT LIVE yesterday, fairly or not, a lot about FIFA 17 feels a little bit like an after thought at the moment. But since we're stuck waiting another nearly two months for FIFA 18 to be here, we may as well make the best of what we've got.
The forty sixth Team of the Week was unveiled today with not a ton of surprises but also a lingering lack of star power. Two weeks from a few of the big leagues' start in earnest, this shouldn't be a problem for long at least.
Long time Arsenal/Koln/German national team standout Lukas Podolski is currently finishing the twilight of his career over in the Japanese league. Accordingly, his play's garnered him a special item this week. He's joined by New England Revolution's (and former MLS MVP finalist) Kei Kamara and the best the Colombian and lesser known leagues have to offer. One time US national side up and comer Mix Diskerud even gets his first in-form. Fair play.
If you're still chomping at the bit for this TOTW side after this hard sell, here's who makes it up as well as their relevant stats. Just a few more weeks, everybody:"

FIFA 18 introduces some new teams to the game, like those from the German third division, 3. Liga, as well as returnees, AC Sparta Prague. Unfortunatley with the sweet comes the sour.
For yet another FIFA (particularly on Ultimate Team), the Brazilian top league, Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, will not be present. Joining them this year is the Chilean Campeonato Scotiabank, who will also not be in FUT and whose players will be generic on Career Mode. Konami signed Chilean heavyweights Colo-Colo and Universidad de Chile to exclusive arrangements similar to those of Brazilian clubs Corinthians and Flamengo, this past August.
While it'll be disappointing to not have the same depth of clubs, many FUT partisans probably won't miss the leagues too terribly much. They traditionally produce lower rated player items which outside of SBCs, lack the value they once did in game for anyone other than the most ardent collectors.
Via EA, here's the full list of clubs in launch at FIFA 18:

If you loved spending some 12 hours a weekend grinding 40 high-stress competitive games of FIFA Ultimate Team, we've got good news.
The FUT Champions Weekend League is back and at least on the surface, is an awful lot like its predecessor.
The game mode was a revelation last season undboutedly; besides advancing the ball on FIFA's march towards legitimacy in sports esports (and beyond), the in-game competition made it truly possible for anyone with enough talent and hustle to build their ultimate team (or a close approximation there of).
While the play-to-win possibilities have never been greater, the game did represent a pretty significant bandwidth grind that either wasn't realistic or was too taxing for many.
So far, the schedule, structure, and even prizes -- as visible in the video overview of the mode above -- seem rather familiar. Of course, particularly when it comes to structure, prizes, etc, the team deputized with being in charge of those can experiment and tweak, as they did throughout the inaugural go of the offering.
Though it's unconfirmed, it's expected FUT Champions' Weekend League will remain the primary qualifier to competitive FIFA events this coming season."

The days of the old FUT Web App are over. During FUT LIVE, EA Sports FIFA announced that the FIFA Ultimate Team companion app has been rejuvenated and rebuilt from the ground up. 
The FIFA 18 Web App will dawn a new interface that should make it easier to manage ones’ club. The app is also coated in the new orange and purple FIFA 18 color scheme.
The app will be available on smart phones, tablets, and PC. Users will be able to continue building squads, completing Squad Building Challenges, and now, they will be able to complete new Daily Objectives -- think the Manager Objectives at the beginning of FUT, but year round.
Much like the initial tasks that every FUT player partakes in upon starting a new club to receive a free gold pack, FUT gamers can now complete Daily Objectives for prizes and more. These objectives will offer players various prizes throughout FIFA 18’s run time. They'll also be randomized so you and your friends won't get the same ones on the same day. 
The Daily Challenges look to be straight forward. An example provided during the stream was 'Keeping Fit.' In this objective, you must apply a Fitness Consumable to a player on your Squad.
Not bad, right?
If you complete all four challenges, then you earn a bigger and better reward.
All in all not too bad. Excited to be able to finally complete SBCs on your PC?"

Not all FIFA Mobile players are fortunate enough to have plugged in, dedicated league mates.
But if you aren't in a competitive league -- or want to be in a more dedicated one -- there's never been a better time than now (if that's you, the Futhead Mobile leagues are currently seeking new members).
Beginning late Friday, July 21, the popular ""End of an Era"" player items make their way to FIFA Mobile. All six 99-rated, Xabi Alonso, Francesco Totti, Frank Lampard, Philipp Lahm, Dirk Kuyt, and Steven Gerrard get to call it a career in FIFA Mobile in style.
To unlock any of the six living legends, you'll need 100 ""Year"" tokens, 25 ""Club Era"" tokens"", and 5 Elite ""Legacy"" tokens (10 ""Club Era"" tokens = 1 ""Legacy"", but with a lengthy week-long cool down timer if you leverage the exchange plan). The awesome news is, while the usual packs (including a special one-time only option) will be available in the store, this is a predominately League v. League powered program, meaning it's open to anyone of all approaches to the game -- so long as you're in a league.
There'll be a twice weekly live event that will give you a random ""Club Era"" token. And just like the recent changes to the ""Retro Stars"" program, those will be tradeable.
An LvL win will get you a Gold Pack that includes a ""Club Era"" token, 10 ""Year"" tokens, and 1 Elite ""Shield"" token. And those ""Shield"" tokens? You guessed it -- You can use them to upgrade the previous League Master players, Mata, Modric, and Pirlo. Each upgrade requires 10 Shield Tokens -- and they're only available (at launch) from LvL wins.
Drawing and losing still net you something as well; a draw gets you a Silver Pack with 5 ""Year"" tokens while a loss gets you a Bronze Pack with 3 of them. So even just being active in a league, regardless of wins and losses, is rewarding now.
This is a pretty cool program for all as it's primarily gameplay driven. If you're not in an active/engaged league and still playing FIFA Mobile, well, what are you waiting for?"

FIFA 18's (pre-)release week is upon us.
With EA Access 72-96 hours away and then less than a week after that to the pre-order release period, Tuesday, September 26, the excitement is reaching a fever pitch.
To ring in the festivities, our friends at the FUT Weekly Podcast put together an action packed episode at and after last week's FIFA Capture Event in London, England. Ben interviewed myself about Squad Battles, the evolution of game play, manual defending and much, much more and also sat down with friend of Futhead, Chu Boi, to talk about his early impressions of what could be the best FUT yet.
Finally, Futhead News market expert Jamey (aka @FUT_Economist) of the FUT Economist team and fellow trader WyseFIFA break down everything you need to know about EA Early Access and how best to spend your time (and FIFA points) to maximize your return. After you've read Jamey and co.'s latest, the podcast can only help reinforce those guiding principles.
If you haven't already done so, be sure to subscribe to FUT Weekly on iTunes or Stitcher.
The hype is real, boys and girls."

Community Teams of the Week have come to an end, with this week's being the final iteration of the long-running program, as it makes way for new things to come. This means that the Player of the Month plan for September may be similar to that of Luka Modrić in June, which only required 2 token, but needed 100 Elite trophies to be traded in as well, in order to get the POTM item.
For those wondering, even with cTOTWs at an end, VS Attack season winners will get rewards moving forward. Expect those announced in the not too distant future.
With what may be the highest fan count ever seen in a single Versus Attack Mode season, Mario strolled to victory with an incredible 1.642 million fans, but only just edging out last week's cTOTW winner themighty for the number one spot. 
Mario seemed to go with a very patriotic approach with his choices, with England’s Tom Ince being the only non-Polish player in his line-up, following on from Din’s Ukrainian laden team a few weeks ago.
The players featured in the second cTOTW of September are:
88 GK Wojciech Szczęsny
86 LWB Maciej Rybus
84 CB Thiago Cionek
91 CB Kamil Glik
86 CDM Eugen Polański
85 CM Karol Linetty
90 CM Grzegorz Krychowiak
96 CM Piotr Zieliński - Master Player 
85 ST Łukasz Teodorczyk
90 ST Arkadiusz Milik
88 RW Tom Ince"

If you were sitting by your PS4 or Xbox One anxiously awaiting the latest and greatest Gold Cup themed orange items for you to pack/snipe to your heart's content, have we got good news for you.
Friday evening once again, EA's FIFA 17 content team went for the gold, releasing new items inspired by the likes of the US Men and Mexico National Teams. Victorious Jamaica is also represented by Portland Timbers FC's Darren Mattocks. Even close-but-no-cigar Canada gets into the act, with an out-of-position Marcel De Jong at Left Winger.
The big enchiladas are the US's Michael Bradley (of Toronto FC) and Philadelphia Union's Alejandro Bedoya along with Mexico's duo of Jose de Jesus Corona and Rodolfo Pizarro. The latter already has a nice Silver TOTS item, but this one is his first gold of FUT 17 -- and inexplicably even upgraded over this TOTS.
Will we see another Mexico-US showdown for all the semi-annual marbles? Stay tuned.
Happy weekending, FUT fans."

Another week, another set of 'Retro Stars' players getting upgraded, and this week we have some very useful position changes.
With the recent release of the League v League Juan Mata, EA decided to move the 92 rated African Tournament RM Mohamed Salah, to the other wing and make him into the second best LF in the game, as he provides a great option for those who decided to build the Blue Star Eden Hazard in either the CAM or ST position. And with an excellent combination of +2 Speed and +3 Ball Control as his boosts, he is one of the best Retro players to date.
Elsewhere, Real Madrid's latest signing Dani Ceballos has received a very nice upgrade to his 92 rated CM St. Patrick's Day.  His original 5% coin boost is now gone, with boosts of +2 and +1 to Short Passing and Long Passing respectively.
Lastly, we have one of the greatest FIFA Mobile players thus far being upgraded to a rating still short of how he played in the first few months of the game. Anyone who has been playing the game since near the beginning will remember just how over-powered the 83 rated MLS Cup Tim Howard was, but now he looks like he could fit into many teams, as he receives a much needed upgrade to 92 rating. Boosts of +1 to both Positioning and Reactions make him one of the best 'cheap' Retro Stars upgrades that we have had so far.
Do any of these players appeal to you? Or are there any players left who you would like to see get an upgrade in the Retro Stars promo? Let us know in the comments below!"

The much ballyhooed ""PreSeason"" program is here. In a twist/surprise, a second concurrent/complimentary one is here as well.
""Treasure Hunt"", in honor of International Talk Like A Pirate Day this coming Tuesday, September 19, brings a new look to FIFA Mobile's global map, while offering plenty of daily/weekly plans to help your progress in PreSeason.
It seems complicated on paper, but what we've been able to digest from the plans is it's a lot like Summer Celebration. You use tokens -- in this case, pieces of a map -- to unlock various Live Events, which the early indications are are quite lucrative. After you unlock all of them, you can trade in all Golden Treasures to receive a pre-season rank up token, 10 Doubloons, plus a ""Now and Later"" Elite Treasure chest. The latter gives you something in both the current and next seasons of FIFA.
Perhaps the most exciting part of the new program is all the new Live Events. If you enjoyed the Football Freeze or Carniball more themed ones that took actual football and merged them with the impossible, you'll definitely dig the more pirate-influenced events rolled out during the course of the next five weeks. 
Stay tuned for plenty of engaging offerings including kicking a cannon ball at a pirate ship, trying to score goals in the face of head winds, and even dodging a shark in the week ahead. The tokens you earn will help your end goals in Preseason as well.
This should be a pretty fun program to cap Autumn the right way."

With the surprise announcement of the conclusion of the Community Team of the Week series, we have an early release of the final Player of the Month item, due to the amount of new content that is being released both today and in the coming weeks. 
Enter 98-overall Real Madrid keeper, Keylor Navas. Navas comes equipped with dual +3 boosts .
As with Player of the Month Luka Modrić in June, there are only 2 tokens to be put into the plan, more is also needed (50 elite trophies) to unlock the upgraded version of the Costa Rican goalkeeper. 
However, with prices being high, and elite trophies also being needed as a part of one of the PreSeason program trade-ins, it's likely that he will be very expensive and may not be/is not as good as the 100-rated Versus Attack Mode Master Jan Oblak or even the 98-overall Retro Stars Thibaut Courtois, who offers an auctionable version of a similar card.
If you're a huge Madrid fan and/or did the first two weeks and need a keeper, this might worth while. He may also help you progress through PreSeason faster. But otherwise, this one may be one to cut your losses on and just skip it in order to push for one of the other new items which are coming out."

Another ""off-season"" (at least for the big five domestic leagues around the world) Team of the Week is here. The net positives are the usual: We're another week closer to the big boys being back at it; the closer we get to those, the more and more gold items we see; and did we mention FIFA 18 being just around the corner too?
An MLS mainstay plus an early season Russian league striker (and former Argentine TOTS recipient) find their way into FUT 17's 45th Team of the Week. Enner Valencia's hot start since moving to North America included a hat-trick for new Mexican club Tigres is validated with his inclusion this week. One time starter pack staple Jonas Olsson gets his first FUT 17 Swedish league in-form as well.
You probably won't make a ton of profit this TOTW, but if you're a dutiful collector or just trying to pass the time until today's new transfers and throwback Squad Buildling Challenges get here, it might just do the job yet.
You can see the Team of the Week 45 squad here:

Note: In EA's TOTW social graphic this week, both a bronze bench player's club and a second player was misrepresented we believe as bronze when he should've been silver (due to a previous inform). We're awaiting clarification on both."

(For those of you who don't know, this TOTW will forever remain in FIFA 17 - from now, until the FIFA 17 servers go down, these cards will be the versions that remain in packs.)
Next Wednesday, EA will launch the FIFA 18 FUT Web App, thus bringing an end to the FUT 17 TOTWs.
With FIFA 18 nearly within reach, take a look at this week's Team of the Week which features a 97 rated ST Lionel Messi card.
Messi's teammate Jordi Alba also make his way into the TOTW with one of the most well rounded LB cards of the season featuring 90 dribbling to go along with 95 pace.
An IF 82 Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting will make FUT fans from back in the day excited, so if you're feeling nostalgic why not try to pack him?
A pair of 93-rated Manchester City players down the middle of the pitch make for lethal green link in the TOTW. Sergio Aguero's 93 pace and 96 shooting put him up there with any of the best ST items in the Premier League, while Kevin De Bruyne's 93-rated item unsurprisingly falls short of his TOTS item.

Last week's score: 12/23
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad Link:http://www.futhead.com/18/squads/23803/


Goalkeeper
Salvatore Sirigu - GK - OVR 82
We look set for back to back Serie A keepers after Sirigu put in a top performance for Torino which saw them run away as 1-0 winners away to newly promoted Benevento. The Italian does like to switch clubs but potentially could settle in his home country. He picked up a 7.5 for his five saves which resulted in a clean sheet.
Defenders
Davide Astori - CB - OVR 81
When it came to gold defenders to say there was a lack of them would be a massive understatement. Had Fiorentina not have won convincingly I feel as though Astori would have been nailed on but considering he scored just the one goal in a 5-0 win it could become overlooked. With not many Serie A options alongside the fact that no single player from Fiorentina stood out he has positive factors in his favour.
Arnaud Souquet - RB - OVR 73
On most of occasions this spot goes to a defender with multiple attacking contributions, however, this time I am going for a big-league name in Souquet. The Nice defender playing an important role in their impressive 4-0 home win over Monaco, picking up an assist alongside a brilliant defensive performance.
Javier Pinola - CB - OVR 76
To complete a rather lackluster defense we have another player which won’t be used by the majority in Pinola. The Argentine more than deserves his spot though after picking up both a goal and assist in a 3-1 home win for River Plate.
Midfielders
Jose Callejon - RW - OVR 82
A bit of a punt now but with not many Serie A options Callejon picked up one of the higher ratings with a 7.5. The Spaniard scored once and assisted another as Napoli went on to beat Bologna 3-0.
Illarramendi - CM - OVR 79
Illarramendi is now 26 believe it or not and although he is no longer the hyped-up Madrid talent he is still more than capable of playing. The Spaniard scored two of Sociedad's four goals as they recorded a 4-2 win over Deportivo picking up a perfect match rating in the process.
Danny Welbeck - CAM - OVR 80
Welbeck has started the season well for Arsenal, consistently performing for them in the opening few games, something of which he always struggled with. He was involved in all three of their goals, scoring twice and assisting another as Arsenal bounced back from their demoralising loss to Liverpool with a 3-0 home win over Bournemouth.
Kevin De Bruyne - CM - OVR 88
KDB has been largely disappointing thus far in the 2017/18 campaign but he was finally given a more attacking role for their game against Liverpool and pulled the strings in the middle to help them to a 5-0 win. Multiple players could get the nod here with Jesus, Sane, KDB and even Aguero being potential selections. De Bruyne picked up two assists and was voted MOTM by many. I can't see City missing out but if that is KDB or not is yet to be seen.
Forwards
Ciro Immobile - ST - OVR 81
There were huge expectations for Milan this season after the summer window and the transfers they made. Lazio knocked them back to reality though putting in a performance which saw them run away as 4-1 winners. Immobile scored three of those four goals and picked up a huge 9/10 from Gazzetta for doing so.
Edinson Cavani - ST - OVR 86
It could have been significantly better for Cavani considering that he hit the woodwork twice but with two goals and an 8 from L'equipe to his name he is well and truly in line for another IF to end the year. Neymar once again stood out and continues to prove that he doesn't need Messi to look good. 
Lionel Messi - ST - OVR 93
Once again, I am going with the big name in Messi. The last couple of times have been punts with it being towards the end of the game but this one is almost a certainty. Messi has one spot left for a special item and with a hat trick on the final week of FIFA what more could you want. Barca ran away as 5-0 winners and although they could easily pick up two from the match it's just Messi for me.
Substitutes
Andre Hansen - GK - OVR 71
A bit of a punt now but if EA consider this one they will see that although Hansen only made 5 saves in a 2-0 away win he was one of if not the main reason they came away with three points. Several of his saves were crucial and he became big in the crucial moments of the match receiving multiple plaudits for this match.
Krystian Pearce - CB - OVR 65
With EA confirming a deal with the Npower leagues in the last few days we are more than likely to see one if not two Npower IF's feature in this side. With no hat tricks present for the first time this season that leaves it down to the defensive side. Pearce scored twice for Mansfield in a 4-1 home win. Alternatively, Daniel Jones grabbed a goal and an assist in a 2-0 win. 
Jamaal Lascelles - CB - OVR 71
Another silver defender and once again he makes it with just the one attacking contributions to his name. Lascelles scored the only goal of the game to help Newcastle to all three points against Swansea. Not only did he score the goal but he also saved one, clearing the ball off the line and went on to claim MOTM as you would expect.
Lee Seung Gi - CM - OVR 69
The easiest selection of the week came over in the K-League after Jeonbuk's central midfielder found the net three times in a closely fought 4-3 win at home to Gangwon. Not the most convincing performance form the reigning champions but three points and an inevitable IF nonetheless. 
Steven Berghuis - RW - OVR 75
Feyenoord continued their 100% start to the season with their fourth win from four coming via a 4-2 away win. Berghuis scored two of those four goals and picked up the joint highest Dutch rating by doing so.
Pierre-Michel Lasogga- ST - OVR 77
The quality of the championship is forever increasing and Leeds have tackled that by signing a big-name striker in Lasogga from Hamburg. The German looked deadly for them, scoring twice and assisting another in a convincing 5-0 win for the former Premier league side.
Stefano Pettinari - ST - OVR 64
Pettinari was snubbed just a couple of weeks ago after scoring a hat trick. The Italian has done it again though, scoring all three of Pescara's goals in their 3-3 draw with Frosinone. Surely not two hat trick snubs?
Reserves
Pascal Gross - CAM - OVR 76
Whoever watched German football knew that Gross was capable of big things, pulling the strings for Ingolstadt. This was his first top end performance in England though almost singlehandedly giving Brighton their first win of the season. The 25-year-old midfielder scored twice and assisted the other in their 3-1 home win over WBA.
Ryota Morioka - CM - OVR 67
Waasland-Beveren recorded an impressive 5-1 home win on Saturday from which two players could get the nod from, firstly striker Thelin who picked up three assists alongside scoring a penalty, secondly, as you can see is Morioka. The Japanese midfielder is often behind their wins and this one was no different with him scoring twice and assisting another.
Mark Uth - ST - OVR 76
There are a few players who could make the cut from Hoffenheim's shock 2-0 win over Bayern Munich but I have gone for the easy option in Uth. The German scored both goals and picked up a perfect 1 rating from Kicker. Multiple strikers performed though which does go against him.
Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting - ST - OVR 78
Another Premier league new boy getting the nod now after it was Stoke who were the first team to stop Manchester United's 100% record. Moting was the player with both the Stoke goals and although they didn't manage to pick up all three points it should be enough for him to receive the nod.
Alfreo Finnbogason - ST - OVR 77
The days are long gone where Finnbogason would be scoring week in week out but he showed that the ability is still there for Augsburg on Saturday, scoring all three of their goals in a 3-0 home win."

It’s FIFA season! With the official launch of FIFA 18 just two weeks away, let’s take a look at what we can expect to see over the next couple weeks. Below, we’ve mapped out everything from potential SBCs to official launch dates (So you can better plan your “sick” days). Please note that some dates are speculative.
September 12th

    Demo Release
                ○ Many believed that the demo was set to drop on the 12th at 1 am UK time. This was based on the release time that Microsoft and Sony advertised on their posts about the demo. As it turns out, the drop was closer to 4 pm UK after the marketplaces for the both consoles updated. In situations like this, EA is at the mercy of the platform (Xbox and PS) which have proven to be a bit inconsistent and unpredictable. This is important to keep in mind for EA Access.

September 15th

FIFA 17 Web App Shut Down
            ○   EA confirmed this date with an article on their site. They did not specify a time. 

September 20th

EA Access (Xbox)
            ○ While the official release date of EA access is set for the 21st, in previous years and in other games that offered EA access (i.e. Madden) the release came sometime the evening before. 
EA Access SBCs
            ○ Last year, EA dropped an “EA Access SBC” that offered a blue kit and a gold players pack. Based on this, we anticipate that EA will do something in a similar fashion this year.



Launch of Weekly/Daily Challenges
            ○ This year, EA are rolling out daily and weekly challenges. Our guess is that they’ll have some daily challenges set up for the EA Access members. We are less confident that they’ll have weekly challenges ready to go on this date because of the awkward start time in the middle of the week. An alternative start date for the weekly challenges could be Monday the 25th.




TOTW 1
                ○ Last year, EA released their first TOTW on the 21st of September. This was one day after the release of the web app. This year, it doesn’t appear that there will be any platform up and running at the launch of this potential TOTW (Web app or EA Access). While this doesn’t necessarily mean EA can’t release this TOTW for FIFA 18, it does make it a bit awkward. In the same vein, it would be a bit awkward to not have a TOTW in packs for EA Access and the start of the Icon and Ronaldo release. 


Launch of Squad Battles
        ○ Under the same reasoning as the challenges, our guess is that EA will have squad battles ready to try in some fashion for EA Access. The only tricky thing here could be the reward system. Essentially a single player version of FUT Champs, we are not yet sure how long the ranking window will be (equivalent to the weekend we had this past year to play 40 games). While it would certainly be a bummer for EA Access members if they weren’t able to try out one of this year’s headline new features, EA might prefer to kick things off at the full launch. 



September 21st

FIFA 18 Web App (Desktop Version)
            ○ EA confirmed this date with an article on their website. They did not specify an exact time, but it does read ""September 21 GMT"".
First League SBC(s)
            ○ Admittedly, the date that we set here is the most arbitrary on this calendar. Last year the Giovinco and Jonas SBCs dropped on the 22nd of September which lined up with the official launch of EA Access for FIFA 17. This year, the advertised launch of EA Access is the 21st. Assuming the same pattern as last year, it’s possible that we could see some sort of league SBC(s) drop on this date.



Daily Gifts
        ○ In years past, EA gave out daily gifts as a reward for opening the web app or companion app every 24 hours. Last year, the daily gifts lasted 4 weeks, starting September 20th (the release of the web app) and ending October 17th. We anticipate EA will do something similar this year.


September 22nd

Companion App Launch
        ○ EA confirmed this date with an article post on their website. They did not specify a time. 


September 26th


Ronaldo/Icon Edition Release Dates
    ○ EA confirmed this date with an article post on their website.


Ronaldo/Icon Edition SBCs
    ○ Given that EA did special SBCs for the EA Access members last year, one might guess that they would have some sort of exclusive SBC for those that ordered the Ronaldo and Icon Edition.


September 27th

TOTW 2
    ○ Assuming EA follow the same schedule as last year, we will likely see our second TOTW.


September 28th


Marquee Matchups
    ○ Last year, EA kicked off Marquee Matchups the Thursday of launch week. Using history as our guide, we think there is decent chance they do this again. 



September 29th


FIFA 18 Worldwide Release
    ○ EA confirmed this date with an article post on their website.


One to Watch Release
   ○ EA confirmed the release date of OTW cards into packs during their FUT Live event and on Twitter.



August Player of the Month SBC -- Mane
    ○ Last year, EA released the August POTM SBC for Sterling the Friday following the worldwide launch. POTM SBCs also regularly dropped last year on Fridays. With this in mind, one could speculate that EA will release the POTM version of Mane on the first Friday at launch. However, this is a very hyped SBC. Everyone and their uncle is planning on investing for this, and in an attempt to throw the investing community a curveball, we wouldn’t be surprised if EA skipped over the August POTM altogether. 


Icon SBC
        ○ Last year EA released an SBC for a loan Del Piero item on the day of the worldwide launch. With this in mind, we wouldn’t be surprised if EA did something similar this year.

As the 'Retro Stars' promo enters its fifth week, we see another former promotional event receive it's first upgrade in the form of 84 rated Heart Breaker Roy Krishna. Released as a part of the Valentine's Day promo, Krishna is an excellent player to use already with his 92 pace and 85+ finishing and shot power. With an upgrade to 91 overall, he now looks even better, and in a relatively underused CF position, his pace boosts could offer you a very nice, and fairly cheap, option to improve your team.
With a recent swell of right wing-backs being released, the position change of the Lunar New Year Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain offers a nice middle ground between the high-value 97 rated Kyle Walker and Dani Carvajal, and the cheaper options of DeAndre Yedlin and Michail Antonio with his 95 rated item. His boosts to Dribbling and Reactions make him an altogether excellent option to try and go for as a medium-level upgrade.
Finally, the Freeze Football promo returns with a bang with an incredible 98 rated Kevin De Bruyne, who has been moved back to a CM position. An upgrade to his original 93 rated item makes him the second highest rated CM card in the Premier League to date. Along with his amazing +3 boost to Short Passing, and +2 Awareness, he is definitely worthy of the 'Master' upgrade slot this week. His hefty pricetag may rule him out for many players, but he will be an excellent addition to any team.
There are still plenty of players left who could get upgraded. Are there any who you want to see get upgraded in the near future? Let us know!"

In just over two months (September 29), FIFA 18 will be available for fans to buy and download. But if you have the itch for new FIFA content, you can pass the time by guessing upcoming player ratings along with former EA Sports FIFA community manager and current YouTuber Chu ""Chuboi"" Morah.
Since late June, Chu has been releasing weekly videos offering his predictions for top tier teams' player ratings. He has covered teams such as Manchester United, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, and Real Madrid. Now Chuboi has released a video discussing his predictions for Chelsea FC's player ratings. 
With the Blues coming off a Premier League title winning season, it is easy to agree with Chuboi that most of the club's players deserve ratings boosts. Amongst those who Chu predicts to increase are Eden Hazard, Cesar Azpilicueta, and Victor Moses. My only personal gripe is that he elected to give Gary Cahill a +1 boost, but after last season's defensive inconsistencies, I believe that the English center back does not deserves an upgrade. 
What do you think? Do Chu's Chelsea's FIFA 18 ratings mesh with yours?

            Updated on
            



Today, we'll be taking a look at the newly released End of an Era SBC Steven Gerrard.

Stevie G receives this item to commemorate an 18-year career, during which he spent 17 years at Liverpool (28 if you count his youth career), before ending his career at LA Galaxy (the club this item is at). Famed for his versatility and all-round ability, his stunning long-range shooting, and his leadership, Gerrard is widely regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of his generation, and by many Liverpool fans (including myself), to be the greatest player to ever wear the red.
In full disclosure, Steven Gerrard is my favorite player of all time. I may or may not have been impatiently waiting with the Companion App loaded on my phone, constantly refreshing the SBC section to see if his SBC showed up. And when it did show up, I may not have screamed like a little girl in the middle of dinner with my girlfriend (we were in the middle of a relatively crowded restaurant, and people definitely game me some really strange looks), and then proceed to chuck any player I could find into the SBC just so that I could get the item within the first 120 seconds of him being released. I also didn't proceed to nearly have a panic attack when I thought I had accidentally discarded him (I hadn't), or rush home just so I could try his item out.
In-game Stats and Ratings
Gerrard has some incredible in-game stats, including 99 shot power, 95 long shots, 98 short passing, 99 long passing, 99 curve, 96 reactions, 92 strength, 99 aggression and 83 stamina.

I used him with the Basic Chemistry style, which gives him a nice all-round boost. He gets a nice little pace boost, a good increase to his finishing and positioning, a marginal increase in passing, a much needed agility boost, a solid defensive upgrade, and an solid boost to his physical.

With the Basic chemistry style, here are his in-game ratings:

Squad
I used Gerrard in this team: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7411799/

I switch to the 41212(2) in-game, and Son is subbed on for Alessandrini. I used Gerrard in the LCM spot.

Stats
Here are my stats with Steven Gerrard:
Price: Around 240K, as I the only player I didn't already have was a TOTS Moreno, that I picked up for 53K.
Games: 30
Goals: 23
Assists: 16
Chemistry Style: Basic
Let's get into the review.
Review
There is only one negative, and it's a minor one. His balance is a little on the low side, so he can fall over at times. That being said, it's no worse than Ibrahimovic or Pogba, and just like with them, it doesn't affect the item too much. However, I feel like I should always include a negative in these reviews (since no items are truly perfect), so here it is.
Now, let's get into the positives.
The first is something that cannot be explained by any stat. He pops up exactly where you need him, when you need him. So far, he's scored nine (9) game-winners, and probably set up a handful more. He can single-handedly win you games, just by being in the right place at the right time, and having the end-product needed to score the goal. He's making the run when no one else is, he's at the edge of the box when no one expects it, and he's just within shooting range when you need it most.
What I loved most about this item was, rather unsurprisingly, his shooting. It is the best in the game, bar none. His long shots are perfect, and he can score from anywhere within 45 yards. His free kicks are deadly, and he scored a couple for me from < 35 yards out. His finesse shots are incredible, and incredibly consistent. His finishing is on another level -- it genuinely feels like 99 in-game. He can score from any angle, against any keeper, no matter how much pressure he's under. The best part is that all of this is true even when he's on his weaker foot -- it feels like a four-star, and possibly even a five-star, weak foot. He can really bang them. He's also reliable when it comes to scoring -- he usually gets one every game, and if he doesn't, he picks up an assist.
This is also one of the best passers in the game, right alongside SBC Alonso and SBC Lahm. This is not surprising, given that his passing stats are almost perfect. His crossing is as good as Lahm's, and his crosses created more chances than I can possibly count. Short and long-passing are absolutely spot on, 100% of the time. I don't think he misplaced more than five passes in all the games I've used him for. My favorite aspect of his passing is how effortless it is. He can coolly play 50-yard passes off his weaker foot, even if he's marked by three men and facing the wrong way. That's how good he is.
Something that surprised me was his dribbling -- his agility was surprisingly good, and his other dribbling stats (beside balance) are perfect. You can dribble with ease, and weave your way past opponents. He's quick on the turn, can stop instantly, and can change direction quite easily when he's at top speed. His first touch is very consistent, and something you can always reliable.
Speaking of his top speed -- his pace is fantastic. He does feel like he has 85+ pace, and at times, he feels even faster. He's quick on the ball, quick off the ball, quick going forward and coming back, and quick when it comes to breaking through the opponent's defensive lines. He can burst away from defenders, and easily hunt down and stop many attackers. His runs were sensational -- most of the time, I'd look up and see Stevie G tearing forward, racing past the defensive line without any difficulty. I had no issues with his pace -- in fact, it was incredibly good in-game.
His defending does feel like it's 90+. He's constantly intercepting and tackling, and he dispossesses opponents without giving away the ball. His aggression makes him win every 50-50 challenge, and he comes away with the ball 9 times out of 10. He could honestly play as my CDM, and he would crush anyone in his path. It's truly ridiculous.
Finally, his physicality. It's one of his best stats -- 90+ strength, paired with 99 aggression, gives you a player that cannot be dominated. He will muscle people off the ball like it's nothing, and will win every 50-50. He is a real fighter on the pitch. His jumping is decent too, and he can win balls in the air. Stamina is only 83, but it feels fine in game. He's running up and down that pitch all game long, and he has something in the tank until the 90th minute. If you have to go to extra time, sub him off - he's not going to survive that.
Summary
This is the one of the best players in the game, in my opinion. He's changed my FIFA experience, and has single-handedly propelled me to another level in the WL. He's an unstoppable force, and he will destroy anything in his path. I'm currently 28-2 in FUT Champions, and it's mainly because of Stevie G. He's racked up 39 goal contributions in 30 games, and that's the best in my squad (Son is second with 25 goals and 11 assists). He's a game-changer in all aspects of the game. Gerrard is about as close to perfection as I have found this year, and I'm really glad that EA gave him an item that honors all he achieved in his career.
For those of you who are still on the fence about getting him, let me tell you this -- there is only one midfielder who I think rivals Gerrard, and it's Ruud Gullit. Even then, I give the edge to Gerrard - he's as fast, as strong, with better shooting, passing and defending, and only slightly worse dribbling. This man is on the level of TOTS Nainggolan, TOTS Hamsik, OTW Pogba, Matthaus -- literally anyone in the game.
The fact that you can get him for < 300K is ludicrous. For that price, this is one player you cannot miss out on.
Rating: 10/10 (I would give him an 11/10)
Value for coins: 10/10"

As we near the end of the year, it seems FIFA Mobile is just beginning, with the launch of its ‘Pre-Season' program. Over the next six and a half weeks, 27 different 100-overall rated players -- one for each spot in a squad -- will be released, which you can work on unlocking through a variety of means.
First, there are three players which can be unlocked just from playing different parts the game, as we're revealed last night on twitter.
By winning League vs League tournaments, you will earn a League token. Trading in 20 of them will give you the 100-rated James Rodriguez who offers boosts of +1 Overall and +2 Dribbling to all your players.
Winning Versus Attack Mode matches will now also give you a Versus Attack token as a reward. When you manage to amass 500 wins, you will unlock the 100 Overall Gonzalo Higuain who will boost your team by +1 in Overall and +2 Short Passing. 
Lastly, a 100 Overall Lucas Biglia is obtainable by completing 1500 live events. That may be a lot, but boosts of +1 Overall and +2 Ball Control are amongst the best available in the game so far. 
These three players are all obtainable without spending any money, just as long as you are willing to put in the grind. 
On top of these three which are available just by playing different parts of the game, there are different players released each week which you can try and complete. This week, there are five players who you can try and complete, with the first four players each having five different stages before you can unlock their 100-rated version, which has +1 Overall to all. Each stage requires a certain number of player specific kit tokens and position specific XP tokens. 
These tokens can be obtained in a number of different ways:
There are three different repeatable live events which will be available daily, with a different one being available for whichever position set - Defence, Midfield or Attack - that you wish to improve.
Next, there are a variety of packs which you will be able to buy with both coins and FIFA Points.
For 150,000 coins you will get 15 random Pre-Season items: 10 gold or better players and a chance at XP or Kit tokens.
For 1,000 FIFA Points, you can choose a position set that you are aiming for and get 15 specific Pre-Season tokens along with 10 gold or better attackers and a chance of some attackers XP or Kit tokens.
Then there is a 10,000 FIFA Points bundle which contains 10 of the aforementioned 1,000 FIFA Points packs plus a guaranteed Kit token 
On top of this, there is a ‘Master Player’ each week who will receive an additional +1 Overall boost to their existing card. The Master this week gives you a chance to upgrade your 100 Blue Star Eden Hazard, irrespective of the position you opted to go for, to a ST version with an insane +3 Overall and +3 Finishing. 
To help you get enough XP to be able to upgrade your desired players, there are a number of new trade-in plans which give you XP as a reward. These plans start with 150 gold players and decrease the number of required player as the players ratings increase, with the highest being 7 95-98 rated players; along with a trade-in of elite trophies, Versus Attack Mode victory tokens, and new FIFA Champion victory tokens. These plans should help everyone be able to increase their chances of completing at least one of the plans that you wish. 
This week, the available players are:
100 ST Eden Hazard with +3 Overall and +3 Finishing
100 RB Serge Aurier with +1 Overall and +2 Tackling 
100 CB Javier Mascherano with +1 Overall and +2 Tackling 
100 CDM Danielle De Rossi with +1 Overall and +2 Short Passing 
100 CM Paul Pogba with +1 Overall and +2 Short Passing
100 ST Gonzalo Higuain with +1 Overall and +2 Ball Control 
100 CAM James Rodriguez with +1 Overall and +2 Dribbling 
100 CDM Lucas Biglia with +1 Overall and +2 Short Passing"

Ones to Watch will be back in FIFA 18 Ultimate Team in a big way. FIFA producer John Shepherd confirmed during the FUT LIVE stream with Castro and Spencer FC that OTW items will feature again in the next version of FUT, and this time earlier than ever. There won't be a slight delay after launch for the dynamically upgraded special items to be released either -- they'll be available at worldwide global launch, September 29.
The first FIFA 18 Ones to Watch were revealed exclusively as well with a few folks we all expected. Manchester United's Romelu Lukaku, Arsenal's Alexandre Lacazette, Bayern Munich's James Rodriguez, AC Milan's Leandro Bonucci, and Juventus' Douglas Costa will get special black items that get upgraded when these players receive special items. And it sounds like this year it won't just be in-forms.
""It won't just be Team of the Weeks this year [that get upgrades]. It'll actually be a little bit more. But we don't have anything to announce today,"" Shepherd added.
Almost everyone loved Ones to Watch in FIFA 17. Sounds like it'll be even better in the next FIFA to come."

Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad Link: http://www.futhead.com/18/squads/142051/



Goalkeeper
Lukasz Fabianski - GK - OVR 80
For the first time in a while now, the keeper we open the prediction with is not a punt, but instead a rather easy selection. Fabianski was vital for the Swans as they managed to come away with a point, away at Tottenham at Wembley. The Polish stopper made a total of eight saves to keep his clean sheet, claiming Man of the Match in the process.
Defenders
Antonio Valencia - RWB - OVR 83
Although United ended up winning by four goals to nil, which makes Valencia's strike that much less important on the score line, the matter of fact is that three of those four goals came very late on. Valencia's goal stands out due to the caliber of it and is perhaps more important than it has credit for. Either way, a United defender with a goal and a clean sheet is unlikely to miss out.
Galvez - CB - OVR 77
Galvez scored the solitary goal of the game in Eibar's Friday night 1-0 win at home to Eibar. The CB picked up a perfect rating from MARCA and with next to no options from the division, I find it hard to believe that he will miss out.
Joshua Kimmich - RB - OVR 81
There were no less than four Bayern players which picked up a 1 rating from Kicker from their 4-0 win over Mainz. However, one player in particular stood out. That is of course Germany's rising youngster, Joshua Kimmich. The defender picked up the assist on three of FCB's goals and helped keep a clean sheet. Lewandowski, Muller and Robben are the others with a 1 rating.
Midfielders
Mathieu Valbuena - LW - OVR 81
There were multiple Turkish league options available to us. However, I've just gone with the one in the side: Mathieu Valbuena. The Frenchman should appear in TOTW on multiple occasions this season with him being more than capable of performing in the best leagues. He scored two of Fener's four goals in a 4-1 win to earn his spot.
Aranguiz - CM - OVR 77
Although it was Volland who found himself on the scoresheet twice during Leverkusen's 4-0 win, I believe that we will be seeing Aranguiz pick up the in-form. The Chilean midfielder scored once and assisted another two which saw him claim the best Kicker rating available.
Paulo Dybala - CAM - OVR 88
From a marketing perspective, EA had it easy when creating a top end side to introduce FUT 18. With players like Dybala, who is 88 rated, scoring a hat trick, everyone expects him to make the side. That is further solidified by the fact he picked up player of the week in Italy with a huge 9 rating. 
Maximillian Philipp - LW - OVR 77
I believe that Philipp's official position is LW, however, you could also interpret it as ST/CF depending on the source you use. Either way, after he picked up player of the week in Germany for his two goals in Dortmund's 5-0 win over Koln, he will be included.
Forwards
Falcao - ST - OVR 84
Falcao has seemed to find his feet again in France after multiple unsuccessful attempts in England. The last couple of seasons have been good for him, picking up another two goals, and an assist this week, helping Monaco to a 3-1 win.
Dries Mertens - ST - OVR 86
Mertens is not the only player to make my side courtesy of two penalties this week. But with the Belgian being a big name, scoring a hat trick in a convincing 6-0 win and picking up an 8/10 as MOTM makes him almost impossible to ignore. Ghoulam is another player with a shout, picking up two assists in the same game. It's Mertens all day for me, though.
Sergio Aguero - ST - OVR 89
Although in a sense this would be a back to back IFs, in terms of FIFA, they do come in different games and thus we should be seeing an opening week Aguero. The Argentine scored three alongside picking up an assist in City's 6-0 demolition of Watford. With Aguero looking lively, it looks promising for City this year.
Substitutes
Robert Zwinkels - GK - OVR 68
There were a few keepers in line for the substitute spot but it largely comes down to two for me: Zwinkels and Matus Putnocky. Putnocky saved a penalty and made a total of six saves, keeping a clean sheet. Zwinkels on the other hand, made five saves in a 1-1 draw with Ajax. The deciding factor in this one came down to the fact Zwinkels was player of the week in the Dutch league, with a big time 8.5 match rating.
Simen Wangberg - CB - OVR 67
Over to Norway now, which is often a division which gets overlooked. With two goals and a clean sheet to his name, Wangberg is one of the best options this week though and thus should make the side with ease. Tromso went on to win the match, 5-0, which could turn out to be a turning point in their season.
Lee Frecklington - CM - OVR 67
This one could easily be overlooked due to it coming on a Tuesday, but with EA recently announcing an official partnership with the EFL, it should improve his chances. Should EA notice the match, there is very little doubt surrounding his inclusion after he scored three from midfield as Rotherham won 5-1.
Keith Ward - CAM - OVR 60
A hat trick from midfield is something you just can't ignore and with Ward doing just that for Bohemians in a 4-1 away win, he looks set to be included for the opening side.
Weverson L. De Oliveira Moura - RM - OVR 67
When it comes to the position of Oliveira, it is very questionable with multiple sources all having different positions for him. Regardless of where he played, we should be seeing him in Wednesday's side though after the Brazilian scored three of four Kashima goals in a 4-2 win.
Alexander Sorloth - ST - OVR 69
It's been a slow start for Midtjylland, who often dominate the division, but there will be multiple positives taken from their 5-1 home win against second placed Hobro. Sorloth scored three of those five goals, which makes him a prime candidate for Week 1.
Mikael Ishak - ST - OVR 68
With three German leagues in action, it is likely that we will continuously see at least one feature each week. This time we stay with a familiar league with the 2 Bundesliga, where Mikael Ishak claimed player of the week after scoring on three occasions for Nurnberg in an impressive 6-1 away win.
Reserves
German Pezzella - CB - OVR 78
Although Pezzella failed to keep a clean sheet while other gold defenders did more on paper, the fact we have a reliable source in Gazzetta for Italy helps the decision process. The Argentine claimed an impressive 7.5 rating, which is not a score you often see defenders with.
Joaquin - RW - OVR 78
At 36 years of age, Joaquin still has it! The Betis winger found the net twice as the scraped three points via a 2-1 home win over Deportivo. With the Spaniard still claiming gold item status, I can't see him missing out on the side.
Pablo Perez - CM - OVR 77
The reserve section was difficult to select with various players looking set to miss out should EA opt for the reserves over the bench for additional gold items. That’s the way I personally believe it should be done with lower items getting at least a chance. Perez could miss out should it happen, but with two goals and an assist from midfield he fully deserves his place.
Cedric Bakambu - ST - OVR 81
With limited La Liga options available in what was a quiet set of fixtures for them, Bakambu is by far the best option. With a maximum three-star rating and two goals to his name, I fully expect to see him included come Wednesday.
Josef Martinez - ST - OVR 76
Although two of Martinez's goals came from the penalty spot, I feel as though the fact Atlanta came away as 7-0 winners drastically helps his cause. It's not often you see such a convincing result, and with a hat trick present in that game, it’s hard to ignore. To then make his case that much stronger, Martinez went on to score another hat trick in a 3-3 draw on Saturday."

One of the more debated aspects of the inaugural go of EA SPORTS' ""FIFA Mobile"" can be put to rest. A reset is happening. EA announced Friday (alongside two blockbuster plans to close their first season out) that a ""Season 2"" will be arriving in November, 2017. 
Though specifics are still to come for the next iteration of the game, those who've played the new ""Madden Mobile"" 18 can expect some of the same look and feel to carry over if history is any precident.
While EA's announcement (and prior years for anyone who's played any of the console FIFAs) makes what happens next relatively clear, there's understandably still plenty out there less familiar with what happens next. Here's the gist of it:
What happens next?
FIFA Mobile Season 1 wraps up in early November. The game, live events, etc that you've grown to know and love will be replaced by an updated version of the game around that time.
Do I get to keep my players?
Nope. If you successfully complete one (or multiple) of a short list of players in FIFA Mobile's ultimate promotion, ""PreSeason"", you'll start Season 2 with a lower rated version of that/those player item(s). The rest of your players will not come over to the second iteration of FIFA Mobile. Other player plans can be completed to get packs and other rewards at the beginning of Season 2 as well.
What about my coins?
Coins don't come over either, sorry.
But surely FIFA Points?
Good news; those will. In almost every iteration of FIFA on console as well as other EA mobile games, you're given a one-time opportunity to migrate your FIFA points when you begin playing the next version of the game.
This isn't fair/I worked so hard for my team/etc.
Unfortunately this isn't a simple situation with a simple answer. Resetting the game gives everyone a shot to build over from scratch. If you think the gulf between those that spend on the freemium game and those who do not is big now, imagine how big it would get if there wasn't some kind of annual reset. 
There are also licensing issues a foot; in order to add new player items, new clubs, new kits, and new badges, per their agreements with FIFA and the various leagues/player bodies, EA have to do this.
We understand this may be the most jarring to Eastern players familiar with ""FIFA Online 3"", but the jurisdictions where that game is released have different licensing rules that would appear to differ pretty dramatically from the rest of the world.
It may seem like a litlte bit of a bummer at first to some, but those well versed in the annual resets from console FIFAs know it's better in the long run.
For everyone else, let the hype begin. If Season 2 is even in the ballpark of the other EA mobile game's latest releases, we should be in for quite a good one."

Last week's score: 8/18
Formation: 3-4-1-2
Squad Link: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7430480/ 

Goalkeeper
Brad Guzan - GK - 75 OVR
With the sheer amount of golds likely to make the cut this week, I think that even though there are arguably better options than Guzan, the fact that he is gold works in his favour. The American keeper made a total of five saves to keep his clean sheet intact alongside Atlanta United taking all three points.
Defenders
Solomon Kverkvelia - CB - 72 OVR
RPL silvers are set to become a lot better with the likely inclusion of Solomon Kverkvelia on Wednesday. The Lokomotiv defender scored the solitary goal of the game as his side managed a 1-0 home win over Arsenal Tula.
Salvatore Bocchetti - CB - 78 OVR
As far as defensive performances go, Salvatore Bocchetti put in one hell of a shift this weekend. Spartak only managed to come away with a point thanks to a 0-0 draw with Ufa, but Salvatore really did shine picking up MOTM after being dominant in the air and making a total of six tackles.
Jonas Olsson - CB - 76 OVR
Jonas Olsson always used to pop up with the odd goal while playing his trade in England. He now plays over in Sweden for Djurgaarden and is still finding himself on the scoresheet. Two goals for him this time around which alongside a clean sheet makes him a certainty for this side.
Midfielders
Quincy Promes - RM - 81 OVR
Although the match was played on Tuesday, the Moscow derby is still a huge game in Russia and thus should have an impact on this week’s selection. Quincy Promes was the stand out player, as he often is, managing both a goal and an assist for Spartak.
Christian Roldan - CAM - 65 OVR
A late entry into the side after Christian Roldan was superb on Sunday evening for Seattle in their 3-0 win finding himself on the scoresheet twice. Could be too late to be noticed seeing as it was Monday UK time, however, with it being the MLS, I can see it slide. 
Yimmi Chara - RM - 75 OVR
I think that if Yimmi Chara had not of been gold that he would have been on the fringe of this side, but considering that he is, I would be surprised if he were to miss out. The Colombian scored two of Junior's three goals in their 3-0 home win.
Joao Plata - LM - 74 OVR
There are several top end silvers included in the side this week and Joao Plata falls into that category. The RSL winger managed to get himself on the scoresheet twice during their 4-1 away win over Timbers.
Forwards
Sebastian Driussi - ST - 75 OVR
Sebastian Driussi is almost a certainty from Zenit after he scored both their goals in a narrow 2-1 win and although he may not be the only Zenit player to feature in the side he is the one I am confident on being included on.
Enner Valencia - ST - 76 OVR
Enner Valencia is making a quick impact in Mexico for Tigres, much like teammate Gignac did when he first arrived. The Ecuadorian managed a hat trick for his new side as they went on to win by the convincing score line of 5-0.
Dejan Damjanovic - ST - 77 OVR
Another familiar face within the K-League is Dejan Damjanovic and he put in one of the best performances of the week managing to score three in Seoul's convincing 5-1 win. Fellow K-League striker Johnathan also managed to score a hat trick, however, due to being in Week 44, he becomes unavailable for selection.
Substitutes
Jose Cuadrado - GK - 72 OVR
Jose Cuadrado had a respectable performance during the previous week but didn't quite make the cut. The Colombian keeper made an impressive 11 saves in total as Caldas recorded a 2-1 away win.
Jonas Thorsen - RB - 59 OVR
Jonas Thorsen looks set to become the second AC Horsens player in as many weeks after the RB assisted two of their four goals during a 4-1 win. Although he did concede, the fact he has two attacking contributions is likely to stand out.
Daniel Royer - RM - 71 OVR
New York Red Bulls lined up in an unusual manor and thus I am not 100% on Daniel Royer being a RM. However what I do know is that he scored twice for them and in turn picked up Man of the Match honors. Sascha Kljestan also picked up both a goal and assist but I believe Royer will be the player receiving the IF.
Gavan Holohan - RW - 58 OVR
My Irish sources are never reliable in terms of position, so I can only guesstimate on the position of Gavan Holohan with RW. The Galway midfielder scored three for them this weekend and although I do struggle with the Irish predictions this one is pretty certain.
Christian Jakobsen - LM - 58 OVR
Christian Jakobsen already has a bronze inform item and thus should he feature again this week he will become a silver. He has a good chance of doing that as well after the winger picked up three assists during his sides 4-1 win.
 Angelo Rodriguez - ST - 72 OVR
Another easy selection now after Angelo Rodriguez banged in three goals helping Tolima to a comfortable 3-0 win. Alongside his three goals, he is also the only stand out non gold striker further solidifying his position in the side.
Edgar Mendez - ST - 75 OVR
This side sees the return of the Mexican league and with it usually comes some gold options. Edgar Mendez is likely to become one of those after scoring twice from the wing in Cruz Azul's 2-0 win."

Since the beginning of FIFA Mobile, everyone has slowly been working their way towards the free 99-rated Marco Reus. Getting him was the end of the road for many people in regards to upgrading your Left Wing position, with a 99-rated player that you get just by actively playing the game for a few months seeming irreplaceable, regardless of his somewhat ‘poor’ boosts of +3 Awareness and +3 Shot Power. 
However, as much as it pains my inner Dortmund bias to say, the time has come for him to step aside and let the new big boy in, as 100-rated Top Transfer master Neymar enters the fold. His boost of +3 Ball Control is better than Reus’s combination of boosts, before factoring in the incredible +1 Overall that makes him a player that simply can’t be ignored.
Comparing the boosts he gets compared to Reus, against those offered by others that you may be tempted by to replace your upgraded LvL Masters, Neymar completely outshines all of them by far, even though he ‘only’ gains 1 base overall rating over Reus.
Let’s take a look at his stats. 

His pace may not be as insane as some others in the game, but he still is definitely no slouch, especially with 107 Acceleration meaning he can quickly burst away from almost every defender in the game.
You can certainly feel his 101 Finishing, and put it to excellent use, whether that be curling efforts to the far post, neat finishes inside the box or cracking long shots. 
His main standout attributes are his dribbling and ball control, which are among the best in the game even before his boosts improve them. Based on his stats, comes as little surprise that he is able to weave between opposition defenders with minimal effort and such high consistency. 
STATS
To get used to him, I played three turns in a League vs League tournament, two turns in League Championships, and twenty Versus Attack Mode games against teams rated between 103 and 117. My team was in the basic and wing attack variations of 343 and 433.

These were his stats after those 25 games:
Goals: 32
Assists: 4
There were a few games where he was involved only once or twice, and some where he wasn’t seen at all, but his influence on many games was incredible and almost single-handedly won me some games in Versus Attack mode against some very difficult and higher rated opposition.
REVIEW
Let's start things off with his pace. As his stats suggest, he is extremely quick, both on and off the ball. Having higher acceleration then sprint speed, unlike Reus, made him feel that bit quicker as he was able to get going in the blink of an eye. And with his high sprint speed to match, he was rarely caught once he was running unchallenged. His speed off the ball meant that he was able to run on to through passes or crosses before the majority of defenders could get close to him. In terms of comparison, he is slightly faster than 99 World Qualifiers Master Gareth Bale, and could cruise past the likes of 99-rated Player of the Month Sergio Ramos and 100-rated Versus Attack Mode Master David Luiz.
Goals are what it's all about, and goals are what Neymar provides. He doesn't have the most powerful of shots, but he makes up for that with the accuracy and consistency of his finishing. I scored several long range shots or curling efforts in at the far post with far more frequency than with any other player I’ve used on the left wing, including the 100-rated Blue Star LF Eden Hazard and Reus. 
Despite passing being fairly irrelevant in game, when I did pass or cross with him, he was extremely accurate with both buttons and tapping/swiping. His pinpoint crossing helped to make up for a mis-directed run or rainbow, instead of the chances being completely wasted. 
By far his best attribute is his dribbling and ball control. The ball stuck to him like a magnet, and he was able to weave in and out of defenders without any issues. His rainbow skill move helped open up defences with ease and led to a large majority of his goals as he was able to get past all who stood up to him, including 99 Global Tour Legend Kostas Manolas on a regular basis. I must say, I  felt far more comfortable using Neymar and cutting in with his rainbow compared to Reus and his roulette, as it was far superior in terms of how effective and consistent it was. One rainbow and he was away from the player attempting to steal the ball away. And with his pace and finishing, running at the keeper in a 1v1 situation almost always led to a goal. 
The only real negative I can think of is that he isn't the strongest of players. If a defender was able to keep up with him, he was at risk of being pushed off the ball. Sometimes that was a positive as it resulted in a free kick, but against some of the more ‘top of the range’ centre backs, his lack of strength meant he lost a key chance that could have resulted in a crucial goal.
SUMMARY
Simple question, is he worth grinding to? I think so.
He is expensive, coming in at roughly 7.5 million coins to build, but you can do that gradually over a number of months, using other plans and events to help build your coin total each week. 
However, when you put that into context, he comes in at roughly the same cost as a 98-rated player bought from the market, and is cheaper than the likes of World Qualifiers Master Gareth Bale, who comes in at roughly 9 million coins to craft, or one of the Player of the Month players which costs somewhere in the region of 5-6 million coins (though Bailly cost a lot more due to the four-token situation/hype) and does not have a +1 Overall boost, making Neymar is somewhat of a bargain at that price. 
Whether you work on him slowly, or deliberately drop down divisions to give yourself easier wins to speed up your progress, saving coins to get him and doing the daily player trade-in for the chance of a PSG contract are fully recommended in order to gain what I feel is one of the best, if not the best, player in the game.
His speed, agility, finishing, rainbow and amazing boosts are all things that have been missing at the LW position for a long time, so passing up on him is at your own peril. 
Rating: 9/10
Value for Coins: 9.5/10"

What is a “Starter Team”?
A starter team is created at the early stages of FUT. It is the first side that you’ll create on your Ultimate Team journey and often features cheap, lower rated players who have stats that leverage game mechanics (pace, strength, etc.) to take advantage of inexperienced defenders just getting used to the new game.
We've broken down and analyzed some of the most popular leagues and nations to base starter teams around. We'll look at their strengths and weaknesses by position and even their and projected value for money. But before we dive into the breakdown, let’s go over our methodology. 
Methodology
We have divided each of our breakdowns into five sections. The first four are by position; attack (ST, CF, LW/LM/LF, and RW/RM/RF), midfield (CAM, CM, and CDM), defense (CB, LB, and RB), and goalkeeper (GK). 
In each of these sections, we give a “Starter Squad Strength” rating out of 10. To arrive at this rating, we went through each league/nation position by position looking to identify players that could slot into starter squads. We only considered players who will likely cost less than 3,000 coins in the first month (give or take a couple 1,000) to ensure that the hypothetical squad doesn’t cost anymore than 25k. We also considered the depth of the starter squad tier of players in our rating out of 10. The more high quality starter tier players, the higher the rating.
We also gave upgradability rankings. “Upgradability” is our term for the potential to upgrade your starter squad with mid/upper tier players from that league/nation. For example, La Liga has one of the highest upgradability ratings in the attack because of the likes of Ronaldo, Suarez, Messi, and many other solid mid-tier attackers. 
Our fifth section is a value breakdown. Here we start with projected “Starter Squad Prices”. In some leagues/nations, we project that to create a starter tier squad, it should cost far less than 25k. For these leagues/nations, we assigned ratings of low or medium/low. For leagues/nations on the opposite end of that spectrum, we assigned values of high and medium/high. 
We also assigned a “Value for $” rating out of 10. This took into consideration the overall starter tier strength of the different positions and the projected price of that team. A high value for $ rating indicates that you can buy players with good stats for cheap.
Also in the value breakdown is a section labeled “Investment Grade?”. Many of the players in these squads have the potential to rise during the first couple weeks of the game. We considered some of the factors at play in the early FUT market, which you can read about in our FIFA 18 Web App trading guide, and predicted if any of the cards in that hypothetical team have the potential to rise in price. 
Finally, in the value breakdown is a label for “Hybrid Ability”. This rating out of 10 reflects our opinion on how easily one could make a hybrid team with multiple nations or leagues using this team as a base. 
Top 5 FIFA 18 Starter Leagues and Nations
Now that we’ve explained our methodology, let’s start by ranking our Top 5 leagues and nations to base a starter squad around. This year, it will be especially important to consider because when you first load up Ultimate Team, you will be presented with the menu at the top of this article. It will ask you to choose a starter nation. Your selection will determine which nation is most populous in your starter packs. Obviously, you’ll want to choose a nation that will get you off to a strong start! 
#1 - 'Calcio A' (Serie A) Starter Team
Do not sleep on the Italian league this year! Arguably the best starter league option, the Serie A boasts a diverse player pool that can fit any player's style. They have plenty of pace all around the pitch, and there is a nice balance between hidden gems and meta options which boosts the league's value for coins. There is also plenty of upgradability, so start getting familiar with 'Calcio A'.

#2 - Bundesliga Starter Team
Although primarily known for its efficiency, the flair of Germany's top-flight should not be ignored. This league looks to be one of the best starter options. A slight lack of depth in the LB position is a con, but all other positions are a go! Plenty of options mean it should be easy to pick up some serious deals.  Great hybrid ability and upgradeability means  you’ll be seeing a lot of the Bundesliga.

#3 - Spain Starter Team
No doubt Spain is an elite team in international football, but can they cut it as a FUT starter team? This year, the answer is a resounding yes! All around the backline, one can find great stats (pace) for a good price. This also holds true for their attack. Their midfield is reliable, but they lack depth of gritty ball winners. Huge upgradability, easy hybrids, and solid value for your coins makes them an attractive option. 

#4 - Premier League Starter Team
The Premier League is, without a doubt, the most popular league in FUT. It has depth and upgradability in virtually every position. This year, Premier League starter squads that focus on wing play with a pivot around a strong holding midfielder will excel. However, because of its popularity, prices will be high, pushing down the value for money.

#5 - Germany Starter Team
The reigning World Cup champs have undeniable talent on FUT 18. Their attacking options look to be stacked at every level, and a robust midfield at every price point. However, their CBs may be too good, putting them out of reach for many starter squad budgets. Regardless, the Germans make for an intriguing option. 


Honorable Mention - Ligue 1 Starter Team
Although primarily known for its flair, the efficiency of France's top-flight should not be ignored. Previously thought of as a luxury league, there are plenty of possibilities for a starter squad. Another league that is held back by their full backs, Ligue 1 looks to make up that lost ground with a creative midfield and deadly attack. Don't be surprised if you see more France than ever before in FIFA 18.


Honorable Mention - Argentina Starter Team 
Last year, Argentine sides felt like they were missing an x-factor. But this year, interesting position changes and young bloods coming into their own, makes them a hot prospect for starter teams. They keep their deadly attack, and add a few defending options to support a reliable midfield. Also, wide disbursement of players makes hybrids easy. If you're looking to spice it up, give Los Gauchos a look.

Now that we’ve gone through our favorite leagues and nations, let’s breakdown the rest of the list. We'll start with the other leagues that we looked at.
Major League Soccer (MLS) Starter Team
Despite recent growth in the league, the MLS remains a comparatively weak league to base your starter squad around. A lack of depth in key defensive areas will likely expose even the best defenders with this year's new crossing mechanics. While there are a number of solid options in select attacking positions, the lack of depth may lead to price premiums, pushing down the value for coins. 

La Liga Starter Team
Players tend to shy away from making starter La Liga teams. The league lacks a solid core of mid-tier players leaving only the ultra expensive/competitive tier to work towards. Despite this, La Liga has an impressive line-up of starter squad depth. While, in terms of numbers, there are less than the other popular leagues such as the Premier League, the lack of mid-tier upgrades could scare enough players away to make value for your money high.

Liga NOS Starter Team
Last year, Liga NOS was a popular league to base starter squads around. Despite a number of transfers that weakened the defense, the league's upper tier of players are ideal for a starter team. Formations that take advantage of wing play will be best suited for this league. While upgradability is very low, value for coins should be exceptionally high.

Russian League Starter Team
If you are looking for an attack heavy fitness/starter team, then the Russian league is the place for you. Plenty of well rounded attacking options and solid midfielders means you'll give your opponents headaches. In addition, while there is exception pace on the backline (you know who we are talking about), we question whether they will stay cheap. Elsewhere, reasonable prices will be a plus, yet exploitable flaws and a lack of depth causes this league to remain on the fringes of a Tier 1 starter league. 

Nation Breakdowns
Finally, let’s break things out by nation. You’ll notice that many of the nations have similar ratings to their domestic leagues. 
Italy Starter Team
Italian teams are somewhat of a rarity in FUT, but maybe it shouldn't necessarily be that way. Aside from weaknesses in wing back positions and a pinch for depth in creative midfield roles, the starter squad attack is on par with the best of the best. In addition, creative midfield woes can be partially remedied by pushing one of the CMs higher up the pitch. Overall upgradeability is a bit weaker than most would hope for, but there are great options at CM/CDM and the wings. They also boast a great value for coins.

France Starter Team
The French were a fixture last year, and this year looks no different. While there are worries about upgradability at wing back, they offer affordable quality on the wings, making them appealing to anyone looking to abuse the new crossing mechanics. A bonus of building a French team is that because of the popularity of nation, many cards can serve as potential Squad Buildling Challenges investments. 

Brazil Starter Team
Brazil has always been a popular starter team nation. While the glory days of skiling to glory may have passed, that doesn't mean the Brazilians can't put together a decent budget squad. Despite weaknesses at CB and ST, there is plenty of pace and flair to go around (as one would expect). While it will be possible to pick up some bargains, we caution that a combo of popularity and a lack of high quality depth could push prices up.

England Starter Team
To be blunt, we don't recommend building an English team. You are essentially building a Premier League team with fewer options. While it is true that you can reach into the lower leagues of the Championship, because of the popularity of the nation and the Premier League, value for coins will be low. In addition, they are curiously lacking in select attacking positions (i.e. LW/LM).

Belgian Starter Team
Belgium seems to be a FUT fan favorite at the moment. They have the upper-tier to compete with the best, and a solid starter tier lineup. Their attack and midfield provide a solid foundation, but select positions lack the depth required to bring them into the elite category. Do not write this nation off though, especially considering its upgradability."

We'd heard some rumblings that more special kits than ever would be in ""FIFA 18"". And while surely there's a finite number of hours for the visuals team to add assets, one popular football club/esports team will get their day in the sun in the late September released title.
As announced Friday afternoon, Hashtag United will have their kits in FIFA 18. It remains to be seen if these will be unlockable through a Squad Building Challenge, be one of the free monthly FUT Champion giveaways, or what exactly.
If you're new to FIFA, Hashtag United is a YouTube featured football club primarily showcased on and around the various social media arms of popular FIFA YouTuber, Spencer FC. The club also sports a strong esports side, with their pro players Tassal 'Tas' Rushan, Ivan 'BorasLegend' Lapanje, Michael 'Dirty Mike' LaBelle, and 'Hashtag' Harry Hesketh all regularly making their presences felt in some of the biggest FIFA/Ultimate Team tournaments out there.
Their many fans will surely be thrilled to have the opportunity to sport the Hashtag look and feel in FIFA, though some lesser profile possessing organizations may perhaps feel a bit hard done. It'll be curious to see what other kind of community-centric reveals will happen throughout the course of this year's game.

UPDATE: Looks like AS Roma esports, Team Liquid, and France's Team Vitality will have kits in-game as well:

After a very odd week which saw a or near a FIFA Mobile Season 2 high three draws, we have another week of derbies, including one of the biggest in Germany. This one sees the return of one of the best games of the season, that we also correctly predicted back in the fourth week of Matchups.
And for the fourth week in a row, there is a chance for one of the teams that we are trying to predict the result of to win the league this weekend. 
Rather than the normal four games, we have an extra game to predict to try to get right this week to help get you the four tokens needed to pick up the reward of your choice.
So, let's get into this weeks games.

Schalke v Dortmund
We start off with what was perhaps the most insane game of the season which we had the difficulty of trying to predict the first time the sides met. Of the three Dortmund games that we have had to predict, I have managed to get each one correct, but I have to admit that this is the one I'm least confident about by a long shot.
Schalke suffered a shock defeat last weekend at the hands of relegation-threatened Hamburg, ending their six game winning streak in which they conceded just one goal. They have a one point advantage over their rivals, and will be hoping to keep or extend that advantage to help them stay ahead due to their inferior goal difference. Their recent form has matched Bayern in terms of points and goals conceded in the last five games, and a win this weekend will help them move four points ahead of their rivals and should almost guarantee them an automatic Champions League spot for next season with just four games remaining.
Dortmund suffered a demoralising thrashing at the hands of Bayern a couple of weeks ago, but came back, thanks a rather lucky opening goal, to beat Stuttgart 3-0 the following week. Away from home, Dortmund were on a seven game unbeaten run until that defeat in Munich, but they had been lacking conviction, and haven’t reached their high scoring streak that they had at the start of the season. With a nearing full strength team at their disposal, they will be hoping to take confidence from their win last weekend to push for the three points with Batshuayi’s scoring run continuing. Three wins from three in their last home games will no doubt give them a much needed boost ahead of what is perhaps their second toughest game of the season, and the one that fans want to wins most.
The last four Revierderby games have ended in draws, with Dortmund winning the two prior to that, and I can see this game being just as close. I feel like this one will also end as a draw, maybe not quite as exciting as last time, but it will certainly be a game worth watching. 
Game played: Sunday 15th, 2:30 p.m. (BST) / 9:30 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw

Benfica v Porto
Our second game this week is one that won’t necessarily decide the title, but could prove crucial as the two teams are separated by just one point and two goals in goal difference. 
Hosts Benfica are currently at the top of the table, having scored three more goals than their opponents. They are in fine form, and will be looking to win their 10th game in a row,   which would extend their unbeaten run to 18. In Jonas, they have the only player who has outscored Messi and Salah in their respective leagues, including eight goals in his last five appearances. This season, only third place side Sporting have managed to take anything away from the Estádio da Luz. One thing worth noting is that he missed last week due to injury, and I haven't been able to see any news about his fitness this week to be able to tell if he's going to play this Sunday.
Porto boast the second best away record in the Primeira Liga, picking up 30 points from a possible 42. Their incredible defensive record, which has seen them average a goal conceded every 163 minutes in the league, is a league high, and a record they will be hoping to keep this week. However, their away form of late has been poor, losing their last two in the league after drawing 0-0 in their Champions League second leg against Liverpool. 
The last three games between these two have ended in stalemate, with Porto winning the two games before that. Although the bookies are predicting a very close game, I feel like Benfica’s excellent home form will help them get the three points, but it may be worth waiting to see what news surfaces about Jonas’s fitness.
Game played: Sunday 6:00 p.m. (BST) / 1:00 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Benfica win

Lazio v Roma
Next we move over to the Derby della Capitale as the two teams from Rome battle it out for far more than just points. This game is extra special, as the two teams are currently tied on 60 points after 31 games, separated by 11 goals on goal difference, so a win for either side could prove crucial as they both battle it out with Inter Milan for the automatic and qualifier spots in next season’s Champions League.
Lazio have the best attack in Calcio A, mainly thanks to the incredible form of Ciro Immobile. With 27 goals, the most in the league, and 9 assists, the second most in the league, the Italian striker has proved all doubters wrong after some disappointing years in Germany and Spain. To put that into perspective, he’s directly contributed to more goals than nine other Calcio A teams have scored this season, and only Messi and Salah have been involved in more goals than him in Europe’s top five leagues this season. Lazio face a tough game against RB Salzburg on Thursday night in the second leg of their Europa League quarter final, so how easily they can overcome their opponents may help them rest a few players ahead of this crucial league game. With four wins and three draws in their last seven games, they are in fine form, having scored two or more in six of those games.
Roma come into the game after one of the biggest shocks of the year as they came from 4-1 down in the first leg to beat Barcelona 3-0 to reach the Champions League semifinals. That result comes as more of a surprise as their league form hasn’t been that impressive since the winter break, having won just half of their league games since the winter break. That result will no doubt give them a massive psychological boost which, along with a couple of days extra rest, may prove decisive in this game. Although they are not as threatening in attack, Roma’s impressive defensive record is what is helping them stay battling near the top of the table. Just nine goals conceded in all 15 of their away games this season shows how difficult they are to break down, something that a top tier attack like Lazio will no doubt see as a good challenge to take on.
Roma have won the majority of recent games between these two, winning seven of the last 11 meetings compared to Lazio's two. I feel like this will be a very close game and very tough to call, but Roma’s two day extra rest may prove decisive and will give them the advantage that they need to help get ahead, but Lazio’s goal scoring prowess will help them stay in the game, so I feel like this one will end as a tie.
Game played: Sunday 15th, 7:45 p.m. (BST) / 2:45 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: Draw

Austria Wien v Rapid Wien
A bit of a more obscure game just now as we head to Austria for the Wien derby between Austria Wien and Rapid Wien.
Hosts Austria Wien are currently sixth with seven games left to play. With nine points to try and gain in that time to be in with a chance of a Europa League qualifier, they will be hoping that a win against their city rivals will help start that chase. Four wins in their last five has seen them recover from a horrendous run which saw them fail to win in nine games in a row, and they will no doubt be hoping to build on that going into the business end of the season. Three home wins in a row will no doubt give them confidence against their opponents, but with those wins all being against the three sides currently at the foot of the table, it remains to be seen how they cope against a tough opponent.
Rapid Wien are sitting in the first of two Europa League spots in the A.Bundesliga, ten points clear of their opponents in third. With just one clean sheet in their last seven games, they can be thankful that their attack is as impressive as it is, with 11 goals in their last four games. Their away form has been fairly in recent weeks, with just one win from five, but they will no doubt be hoping that their good home form can finally carry over on their travels.
Games between these two have been fairly interesting recently, with the home side having only won one game out of the last 12 meetings, with the visitors winning on eight of those occasions. Rapid have been particularly successful when playing at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion, with five wins and a draw in their last six games away to their city rivals. I feel like recent form overall may favour the hosts, but the visitors record against them and their confidence will help carry them to victory.
Game played: Sunday 15th, 3:30 p.m. (BST) / 10:30 a.m. (EST)
My prediction: Rapid Wien win

PSG v Monaco
Lastly, we head to France where the two biggest teams in the country face off in a top of the table clash. 
After Bayern Munich and Manchester City failed in the last couple of weeks, PSG have a great chance of sealing the Ligue 1 title, needing only to prevent their opponents from winning to take the title. The hosts will come into the game high in confidence after winning the Coupe de la Ligue against Monaco just two weeks ago. Home and away losses to Real Madrid may be in the back of their minds still, but they are clear favourites for this game, having scored an average of 3 goals per game in the league, and conceding a goal every 131 minutes on average. On top of that, they have not dropped a point at home all season, in an incredible run that has seen them score 61 goals in 16 games at the Parc de Princes in the league.
Monaco are the only team who can technically catch the Paris giants, but with 14 points to gain over just five matches, it looks like an impossible task. They have proven difficult to beat though, and are unbeaten in the league since the new year. However, their defence has been struggling of late with no clean sheets in their last seven games. Away from home, Monaco haven’t been too impressive this season, picking up just 26 points from their 15 games on the road this year.
As expected, PSG are big favourites for this game, and recent games between these two would favour them massively as well. PSG have won the last five encounters against last years champions, winning 16:3 on aggregate over those games. I expect that run to continue and the hosts to claim the Ligue 1 title.
Game played: Sunday 8:00 p.m. (BST) / 3:00 p.m. (EST)
My prediction: PSG win

That’s what I think might happen this week, with good mix of games to try and predict this week. As a reward, you can pick yourself up an 85 Overall CM Andrija Zivkovic, or some ever important coins to help you with SBC’s or get to the next level with your team.
As always, good luck and happy predicting!"

FIFA 18 Ultimate Team's Team of the Week 30 brings some interesting names to the virtual pitch. One curious omission though will surely have folks speculating however.
A 92 RM (!) Christian Eriksen, on the heels of keeping Spurs' Premier League winning streak afloat, joins a 93 CF Paulo Dybala -- who now has in-forms at LW, RW, CAM, and CF -- to lead the way this week. And we couldn't forget Manchester Derby game-changer, Paul Pogba. The blue-tipped mohawk sporting dab-king turned that rivalry contest around, and for it, he gets a 91 CM black-and-gold IF.
Those either playing the Path to Glory dynamic player items market or just fans of having items whose stats boost after top performances get a trio this week: West Ham's Joe Hart, still with a shout at England's third goalkeeper spot, get his first IF of FIFA 18. His PTG will now go up to 84 overall. Eden's brother Thorgan Hazard jumps to 84, while Danny Welbeck's late-winner as Arsenal continues trying to leapfrog Chelsea for fifth sees him up to 83 overall.
We've reached the point of the FUT IF cycle where ""sleepers"" are few and far between, but hey look, Will Grigg is all the way up to 84 overall (!). And it's hard to say a TOTW starter is anything of the sort, but Memphis Depay's 85 striker (insert all the fire-emojis) could potentially be a late-season FUT Champions darling.
Last but not least, the elephant in the room: no Lionel Messi. Yes, Tuesday was a disaster for Messi's FC Barcelona. But a hat-trick from midfield over the weekend should've gotten it done. Team of the Knockout Stage incoming?

Amongst the rows of monitors and multitudes of colorful costumes at PAX East, a FIFA tournament with global implications is underway. A four day affair, this FIFA tournament features professional players from 19 MLS clubs, who are vying for two places at the FIFA Global Series Qualifiers. The eMLS Cup kicked off yesterday with Preliminary Rounds just wrapping up today, so let's dive into the action.

What is eMLS?
If you aren’t familiar with the eSports branch of Major League Soccer, the organization released this tidy video FAQ to get you up to speed. 
.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }

Standings after Preliminary Rounds
After two days of two-legged preliminary matches, the tables below provide a snapshot of how the “regular season” ended. Players will now be seeded based on their standing within their conference, determining their path to the final over the next two days.



Players to Watch & What to look forward to?
Being the inaugural year for the eMLS, the players at this event came from a wide variety of backgrounds. Not every player was a traditional pro, and the diversity made for some interesting speculation about who were the favorites entering this cup. 
However, with today's standings indicating a significant portion of matches, the field looks a little more transparent. Experienced pros like Memo Trevino (Kid M3Mito) and Chris Holly (didychrislito), of Houston Dynamo and New York City FC respectively, hold down the top spots. Some dark horses have emerged like FUT Champions Barcelona qualifier and Sporting Kansas City’s Alex Betancourt (SKC Alekzandur), who split his tie with first place Trevino 1-1, as well as Toronto’s Phil Blake (PhilB94) and FC Dallas’ Alan Avila (AlanAvi) who are both former professional footballers. 

Another relatively unknown player emerged in Graham Ellix (Skamm), who topped the Eastern conference after Thursday, but a rough finish saw him fizzle. He could be one to watch if he can return to form, and might even surprise a few. Also, be on the lookout for two seventeen year olds, in Philly’s Cormac Dooley (Doolsta) and Vancouver’ Erfan Hosseini (Skill Shack) who have held their own through the tournament, looking like great talents for the future. Unfortunately no Buck Army, but other fan favorites like Giuseppe Guastella (GGGodfather) and Mike La Belle are all still in the mix, although the later has his work cut out for him as an 8-seed.
Here's the complete bracket for the start of the playoffs (e.g. the knockouts):

Going forward, both Saturday and Sunday’s single elimination playoff rounds will be live streamed so we can get an even better look at the level of competition at the eMLS Cup. Running from 1-4 p.m. (EST), you can tune in on Twitch. With commentary talent including the SpinBros, Air Japes, and Chu Boi this is one you won’t want to miss!"

Diego Maradona's been one of the most anticipated FIFA Ultimate Team Icons (formerly Legends) for some number of years now. When Chu Boi, Mavric Wolves, and Castro revealed that the Argentinian all-time great would be making his way to FUT, it was hard not to get excited.
Now we know just how impressive his FIFA 18 stats will be.
In a Sunday afternoon U.K./late Sunday morning in the US tease, EA continued to hype Tuesday's ""FUT Live"" by revealing the 95-overall rated Maradona item:

This follows on the heels of Friday's reveal of ""R9"" Ronaldo's rating and our first look at the new FUT item designs.
Maradona's ratings look almost exactly what we'd expect from one of the greatest ever to lace them up. The only question that remains is whether or not Pele will be the same or higher rated.
In other news, for those that missed it on Saturday, the only goalkeeper to ever win the Ballon d'Or, Russia's Lev Yashin, had his ratings unveiled as well:
Highest rated GK in #FUT18? Maybe. Tune in to FUT LIVE on Aug 1 to see more ICONS + first look at #FIFA18 gameplay. https://t.co/Pa2xrdocNf pic.twitter.com/9umgQuiDX7— EA SPORTS FIFA (@EASPORTSFIFA) July 29, 2017

Many seem most excited about Yashin's signature hat making its way into the game. But there's a very decent chance if Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer gets a slight downgrade, he could be one of if not the best keepers in FUT 18.

Which Icons are you most excited about? Who else do you hope to see announced Tuesday at FUT Live?"

Day 3 had it all at the inaugural eMLS cup. Plenty of goals, a penalty shootout and great commentary marked another successful day at this tournament. After yesterday saw the end of the “regular season”, today was all about single elimination playoff matches. There were two rounds today with the Conference Quarterfinals and Semifinals, so continue on to our coverage of each individual match below.

Round 1, Conference Quarterfinals
Eastern Conference Quarterfinals
NYCFC (1) vs Orlando City FC (8)
NYCFC’s Chris Holly (didychrislito) defeats Orlando’s Abraham “Abe” Valbuena (FIFA Abe) 3-1
From the start the number one seed showed his quality, with Chris using his Gareth Bale to open the scoring after 11 minutes. Orlando City’s Abe was definitely not out, and held his own testing Chris at the back; however, he wasn’t able to get anything going before Chris netted another to go up 2-0. Eventually Abe did pull one back, but a chip shot from Chris put the game to bed at 3-1. 
Montreal Impact (3) vs Chicago Fire (6)
Montreal’s Lyes Ould-Ramoul (LyesMTL) defeats Chicago’s Edhem Jukovic (HekTicJukeZ) 2-1
A matchup that did not receive quite as much attention, but still a very tight affair throughout. The first half finished level on 1-1, and the second half was just as tight until Lyes’ Ignacio Piatti smashed in the winner at the 78th minute. The tricky Argentine has been Lyes’ lifesaver more than once this tournament, and it might speak to the importance of having gold MLS options going forward.

Philadelphia Union (4) vs Columbus (5) 
Philadelphia's Cormac Dooley (Doolsta) defeats Graham Ellix (Skamzz)  3-2
Doolsta opened the scoring early with Sergio Ramos from a corner after only 9 minutes. Skamzz simple but calculated build up almost led to a response in the 18th minute but an equalizer did come for Skamzz nine minutes later through Leonel Messi. Moments later, Doolsta was back on top with a top of the box thunderbolt into side netting making it 2-1. He kept the pressure on with three great chances to make 3-1, but instead Skamzz’s found his second equalizers off a give-n-go with Messi on the stroke of halftime.

The second half began in a much tighter fashion. It opened up after Doolsta played a tidy ball through Skamzz’s defense in the 79th minute goal, and it was Paul Pogba grabbing his brace off a rebound to go up 3-2. Doolsta held out with smart possession play to secure his place in the Eastern Conference semifinals.
Toronto FC (2) vs New York Red Bulls (7)
Toronto’s Phil Balke (PhilB94) defeats NYRB”s Mike LaBelle 1-0 A.E.T
This tie began as a cagey affair, and in the 38th minute Sebastian Giovinco was denied by incredible save from Mike’s David De Gea. The tight affair continued with tactful possession from both players leading to 0-0 scoreline at half. In the dying moments it was Mike’s turn to be denied after a beautiful ground cross picked out a man at the back post, but an even better block from Phil’s defenders kept the contest level. 
This one would be decided in Extra Time after Phil put away a goal in the 107th minute with One to Watch Neymar. The five-star weak foot coming in clutch, but Mike would be lamenting a poor giveaway that created the chance. Phil was relieved at the final whistle, and we are sure Mike is wondering how his 90th minute didn’t find the back of the net.
Western Conference Quarterfinals
Houston (1) vs San Jose (8)
Houston’s Memo Trevino (Kid M3Mito) defeats San Jose’s Alan Ortega (CaliSCG) 3-0
Messi goes bar down after a class finesse shot from the top to put Memo Trevino up 1-0. Then moments later Cristiano Ronaldo doubled his lead after a lethal counter attack. Goals kept coming, and right before half, N'golo Kante would increase the lead to 3-0, leaving Calli with a mountain to climb. The second half would be a much more controlled game, but Memo would see the game out at 3-0, and book him a place in the semifinal. 
FC Dallas (3)  vs Minnesota (6)
FC Dallas’ Alan Avila (AlanAvi) defeats Minnesota’s Elias Baca (Pacify x) 6-1
FC Dallas' Alan went up 1-0 early, although viewers weren’t able to see that goal. Minnesota would have the lionshare of chances before half, but the scoreline remained the same. Right after the break, Alan went 2-0 up with Messi netting his second. The contest heated up after Pacify x pulled one back with Minnesota's own Sam Nicholson. Hope would prove to be short lived. Just moments after, Alan would respond with Ronaldo to restore his two goal advantage at 3-1. To compile Pacify’s misery, Kellyn Acosta made it 4-1 and put this game to bed, eventually finishing 6-1.  

Sporting Kansas City (2) vs Portland (7)
SKC’ Alex Betancourt (SKC Alekzandur) defeats Portland’s Edgar Guerrero (XThiagpSilvaO) 3-2
Alekzandur opened the scoring with beautiful finesse from Cristiano Ronaldo, and after half, Alekzandur doubled his lead. He further cemented his position after going up 3-0, and with the third goal making it a hattrick for CR7. Edgar immediately responded off kickoff, which was a positive as he didn’t deserve to be shutout. In 90th minute stoppage time, Edgar grabbed another to make it 3-2, but it was too little to late.

Vancouver (4) vs LA Galaxy (5)
La Galaxy’s Giuseppe Guastella (GGGodfather) defeats Vancouver’s Erfan Hosseini (Skill Shack) 4-3
Giuseppe came out hot with a great chance, which was in turn answered by Erfan creating a chance of his own. Yet, Giuseppe would keep up the pressure and find an opener with Messi on a low driven. Erfan kept the game tight after finding an equalizer with Ronaldo in the 30th minute. Giuseppe broke the deadlock, with his team's very own Romain Alessandrini to make it 2-1 right before half. The second half began with Giuseppe’s De Gea making two great saves, and on the counter Alessandrini made it 3-1. Following that, the players exchanged goals making it 3-2 then 4-2 in quick succession, but it would finish at that score.

Round 2 Conference Semifinals
Eastern Conference Semifinals
NYCFC (1) vs Philadelphia (4)  
*NYCFC’s Chris Holly (didychrislito) defeats Philadelphia's Cormac Dooley (Doolsta) 2-1 A.E.T *
Both players came out testing eachother, but Doolsta had the first chance falling to convert with Ronaldo. After a surprising bounce going forward, Chris took the lead through a CR7 of his own. AirJapes almost lost his rocker when Chris decided to chip Doolsta looking for that two goal lead, but the linesman was on hand to call it offside. With that slight turn of fortune Doolsta bounced. A little luck of his own allowed him to find the back of the net with Ronaldo after a finesse from the top of the box making it 1-1. 
Coming out of half, Doolsta was pressing forward and creating quite a few chances. That being said, Chris was still looking dangerous on the counter attack. Doolsta continued to dominate possession, but Extra time was on the cards. Although the Philly man controlled most of the ball, Chris did what he does best and put one in off the post making it 2-1. And so, it would end at that score after an amazing match.   

Check out Chris' winner here:

Toronto (2) vs Montreal (3)
Montreal’s Lyes Ould-Ramoul (LyesMTL) defeats Toronto’s Phil Balke (PhilB94)  4-3 after penalties. 
An eMLS version of the 401 Derby kicked off this portion of the semifinal, and it was the definition of a cagey affair. Both players were content with holding possession and trying to find the other’s weaknesses. The half finished 0-0, and looked to be going that way, but an absolute beauty from Pogba put Phil up 1-0. Then with seconds remaining Lyes delivers a beautiful cross to equalize and send this game into extra time as well.
With only half chances in extra time, we got to see the first penalty shootout of the tournament. Both players converted their first attempts, but Lyes stayed home to deny Phil’s second. To compile his misery, Phil missed his third, but there was hope after Phil denied Lyes’ third shot with a kicksave. In the end, Lyes stepped up with ice in his veins going back down the middle to secured his spot in the conference final.

Western Conference Semifinals
Houston Dynamo (1) vs LA Galaxy (5)
Houston’s Memo Trevino (Kid M3Mito) defeats La Galaxy’s Giuseppe Guastella (GGGodfather) 2-1.
At the start, Memo used patience to pick a part Giuseppe's defense, and it took a brilliant diving block from Gregory Van der Wiel to deny the Houston man and keep it level. Gustella’s experience allowed him to stay cool and slot away a tidy low driven shot with Luis Suarez to make it 1-0. It would remain that way though half, but Memo would pull it level off a well worked free kick routine that ended in a Ronaldo low driven shot. 
Neymar would again be in the spotlight for Memo, with a quality finish in the 78th minute giving him a 2-1 lead. At this point Giuseppe brought on LA’s main man Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who immediately made an impact. Two extremely close chances for Giuseppe put pressure on Memo, but it would remain 2-1 with Houston advancing to the conference final.   

Sporting Kansas City (2) vs FC Dallas (3)  
FC Dallas’ Alan Avila (AlanAvi) defeats SKC’ Alex Betancourt (SKC Alekzandur) 3-2
The scoring started around the 30 minute mark, with Gareth Bale putting one top net from a beautiful shot to give Alekzandur the lead. FC Dallas’ Alan was not out, as he used his TOTY Messi to find an equalizer through a tidy header on the 41st minute. The fireworks kept coming as Bastian Schweinsteiger converted off a SKC corner making it 2-1 to Alek at the half. 
The second half seemed poised to be a snoozer, but an 85th minute equalizer from Messi changed all that. Alan Avila was pumped and the rest of the crowd was feeling it too. Both players changed their tactics to position themselves for the win, and Alan would find it with a low driven shot from Ronaldo beatings Alekzandur’s De Gea. An amazing finish to a truly exciting game.
Day 4 Outlook
Tomorrow will see the Conference finals, with the winners squaring off in the overall final. With $10,000, a beautiful trophy and two spots in FIFA Global Series on the line, these matches shouldn’t disappoint.  So, after an incredible Day 3 make sure to tune in to the livestream tomorrow on Twitch (also hosted on Futhead.com) from 1-4 p.m."

Futhead's Mobile Leagues are looking for a few good men or women.
After recently splitting into two leagues — one focused on the highest levels of competition in the game and another more so on mixing business and fun — we're looking to grow.
We're currently seeking FIFA Mobile players with 103+ OVR squads who can score 20+ goals each LvL for our legacy league (currently ranked 30th in the game) as well as players who are 95+ OVR and can score 15+ goals each LvL for our newer project.
If you regularly perform in the second league and your team is higher ranked to match, there'll be opportunities for promotion to the competitive league for those looking to start out slower before competing at the top of the FM leaderboard.

The MLS All-Star team is the final hoorah in the FIFA Ultimate Team season, and it looks set to produce some incredible items yet again. The full 24-man squad was announced earlier on today, so lets get into some more detail about who you will be able to pick up on the market in the coming weeks. 
Note: FC Dallas' Hernán Grana is not in FUT, so he will not receive an item.
From the fan-voted XI, Sebastian Giovinco's incredible performances in the league continue to impress, but it was his goalscoring in games of FIFA which saw him win the 'More than a Vote' competition, as he scored the most goals in FUT and Seasons, which secured his obvious spot in the team.
Nemanja Nikolić took a short time to adapt to life in the MLS, but after a month of adapting to his new surroudnings, he went goal-daft. With 15 goals in 15 games, the Hungarian international is in fine form, and a looks set to get a well deserved TOTS.
Bastian Schweinsteiger may not be able to win the World Cup with Chicago Fire, but he will be hoping to help take the All-Star team to victory over Real Madrid. The German legend may have only moved to the MLS at the end of March, but, as a firm fan-favourite, he has been selected for the squad.
Similar to Schweini, Tim Howard's move the Colorado Rapids only happened in March, but with his status in the US game, he will receive a very good TOTS.
Perhaps one of the strangest position changes of the year, Graham Zusi looks set to earn his fifth TOTS in six years, but at a rather unorthodox RB position (where he moved for Sporting KC and also features for the US National Team), compared to his LW base item. How good he is in that role remains to be seen, but it will definitely be an interesting position change.
Another player who is haivng an excellent first season in the MLS is Miguel Almirón of Atlanta United. With 8 goals and 6 assists, he has been crucial to their good run in their first season in the MLS, and has been one of the most consistent performers in the legaue so far.
One player who will almost certainly be seen in the squad of a certain Twitch streamer (Castro_1021) is Mexican striker Giovani Dos Santos. Mexican fans are known for their incredible voting power, so despite the L.A. Galaxy being in such poor form, Dos Santos being included comes as no real shock.
Finally, MLS Commissioner Don Garber's picks are highlighted by newly nationalised Dom Dwyer. The English-born USMNT striker scored in both of his first two appearnaces for the national team, bringing a lot of attention on himself, which was enough to see him included in the roster for the All-Star match.
The match takes place in Chicago on August 2, and players who drop out of the squad will be replaced by a member of the reserve list.
You can see the full squad of players, along with their predicted TOTS item stats here!"

Marco van Basten, Lothar Matthäus, Roberto Carlos -- players don't get much more iconic than the latest trio of Icons to reach FIFA Mobile. The success of SBCs has allowed for their implementation in the acquisition of Icons, you'll need to complete a set of 5 SBCs of increasing difficulty to obtain an Icon. Meanwhile, Champions League Man of the Match players return and the Weekend Tournament continues to offer some tantalising rewards as we wrap up EAster -- don't forget to use up your eggs before the promotion ends -- good luck finding a Golden Ticket! 
Weekend Tournament
The third Weekend Tournament is here, and a whopping 1800 SBs are up for grabs. This time around, the OVR range has been increased from 70-90 to 70-95, have a look at the VSA S1 players for upgrades so you can keep competing without facing Counters.
The 7 win SBC has 200k coins and 50k XP as rewards, while the 10 win SBC has a speedy 90 LW Dries Mertens on offer if you can string together those 10 wins. As always, check out Futhead's SBC features to get a head start on the players you need. 
Man of the Match
Previous weeks have seen the return of Man of the Match packs, featuring chances at players whose real life performances in games have seen them chosen as that game's best player. These packs, which cost 1000 FP, had small chances at tradeable MOTM cards, and for the Champions League quarterfinals a similar system is used. This time, the chance of packing a UCL-inspired MOTM is much higher, however, these MOTM players are untradeable, so only go for the packs if you are really keen on one of the new MOTMs. Featuring in this round are Real Madrid's 92 rated CM general Toni Kroos, Bayern Munich's longest serving player Franck Ribéry as a 91 LM, Barcelona's utility man Sergi Roberto picks up an 89 RM in his third different position this season, and the scorer of Liverpool's stunning second Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain grabs a 88 CM for his wonder goal against Manchester City.
Main Icon Chapter
The main Icon Chapter has undergone some renovations of its own, being reduced to 8 nodes consisting of 7 weekly Skill Games/Icon matches plus one Mystery Match. Skill Games and the Icon match reward 5k Icon XP, while the Mystery Match is random for each user from a pool of 10 different scenarios. Winning the Mystery Match will earn you an Icon Token or a random Icon, 8 Icon Tokens can be traded in for a random Icon. This means that every 8 weeks you will be able to earn at least one guaranteed Icon. You can speed this up by buying the Icon Bundle in the store.
Icon Packs
Icon Packs are unlimited and cost 1000 FP each. They contain 10 gold+ players with a high chance of being from the league/nation of the current Icons. The Icon Bundle can be bought once a week and contains 10 Icon Packs plus an Icon Token as a Bundle Topper.
New Icons
Along with MVB, Matthäus, and R. Carlos, the first round of the Icon revamp sees Filippo Inzaghi, Jay-Jay Okocha, and Rio Ferdinand  return as sets of 5 career-related SBCs. The new system for Icons requires one to complete these five SBCs before obtaining the Icon themselves. They are separated into Attackers, Midfielders, and Defenders chapters, and we should be seeing three new Icons each week along with three 'old' Icons being re-released in this new format.
The first SBC for each Icon is 'generic' and simply requires a squad of 11 players that average to a certain OVR. No positional requirements, no league requirements, just 11 players with a minimum OVR. This OVR differs from Icon to Icon, with MVB (93 OVR) requiring an 81 OVR squad and Inzaghi (87 OVR) requiring a 77 OVR squad as examples.
The second SBC is the 'Office' and requires a squad of 11 players from 11 different nations.
'Career' is the third SBC theme, requiring a minimum OVR, and players from the leagues that Icon has played in throughout their playing days.
'Origins' needs a squad of players of the Icon's nationality, again with a minimum OVR, and also a minimum number of players in position.
Finally, 'Legacy' features the club team that the Icon made the biggest impact on, completing this last SBC will earn you the Icon's player card.
These SBCs won't be cheap, but offer some tantalising rewards (coins, SBs, generic XP, and player specific XP) along the way. MVB's first SBC offers 250k generic XP, 2.5 million coins and 100k MVB XP for an 81 OVR squad, for example. 
The new Icon system is not designed to be accomplished in one sitting bt all, rather a work in progress throughout the rest of FIFA Mobile Season 2.  Icons released in SBC format are now permanent, which means you've got a long time to gather the resources if you're keen on playing with R. Carlos' 120 Shot Power and 108 Free Kicks. 
This also allows you to plan in advance for unreleased Icons -- think PSV, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Real Madrid, and AC Milan players for Ronaldo Nazário. All new Icons will be a minimum 90 OVR  and will no longer have an Icon campaign. All current Icon campaigns will remain if you have already unlocked them. 
Obtaining an old Icon will no longer unlock their Icon campaign; think of these as exclusives for those who have already obtained those Icons. For example, if you missed out on Rio Ferdinand the first time around, but complete his SBC, you won't be able to access his Icon campaign. 
Without Icon Campaigns, player-specific XP can be scarce, however the player's SBCs will reward some player-specific XP, plus you can also use the generic XP you earn to train your new Icon. If you require more XP, two 1000 FP packs are available once you complete that player's 'Legacy' SBC which will give you some more player-specific XP to use.

Market Overview
The FUT market remained pretty quite this week, continuing its gradual increase; however, EA spiced it up by dropping the FUT Swap promotion on Tuesday. This content blindsided us all, and something fresh was a nice touch. The increased hype helped continue to keep players engaged, but it also might have started to get their gears grinding about some big promotions on the horizon. Looking back to last year, the Team of the Knockout Stage was an excellent promo, but it also crashed the market. So, with the preceding fears in mind, the end of the week saw a dip begin in general market prices.   

Turning to the Ones to Watch sector, this index had very positive week! A solid TOTW inclusion, plus a couple high profile items that narrowly missed out demonstrated these items can still be profitable investments. It also affirmed our recommendations about selling into the hype, because it is super important to take profit whenever you can get it at this stage. After a bumber week, keep reading to see how you can use the OTW sector to possibly make a few coins to blow on packs in a about a month. 

Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats



The graphs above are concise overviews of all the keypoints from the data that I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the OTW market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:   We are entering a stage in FUT where the market will begin to get shaky, so now it’s more important than ever to stick to high hype potential individuals. Looking at the high & low spreads, consider players who have taken a hit this week, but still have significant high values. We’re talking about the likes of Nelson Semedo, Diego Costa and Virgil Van Dijk who will offer solid risk/reward positions this week. 
Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the OTW player’s item.
-- Quick take:  There are some substantial figures in this week’s weekly rundown, but that is giving us hope if the market can stay relatively stable for another week or two. Kylian Mbappe, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Nicolas Tagliafico are players catching our eye with large volatility that could be profitable to pick on open bid and flip quickly. 
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Another week with a multitude of various figures here; however, items’ betas could be really helpful when trying to plan for impending changes in the market. If you’re trying to stay cautious we’d recommend staying away from the likes James Rodriguez and Serge Aurier considering if there is another market dip these prices are poised for significant drops.  

TOTW Shout
A lot to talk about this week with four OTW items generating some serious hype, but ultimately only one player made the cut. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted a brace and unselfishly forwent a penalty in his weekend performance, which earned him a tidy upgrade to 90 overall. With that 98 pace and BPL connections, I might be sitting this Weekend League out! 
Now for the remaining three players, Alexis Sanchez dashed many investors’ hopes when he was excluded from TOTW 29, but that was just another prime example of how selling into the hype is a great call.  Joao Mario also had a solid performances  after he grabbed a goal, but was always a dark horse. Lastly, Alexandre Lacazette has an asterisk next to his TOTW consideration because it’s more of a Man of the Match Shout. After slotting away two goals in the Europa League first round, make sure to track him going forward as he could easily get an upgrade.
In-depth daily analysis
For your sake and mine, every week I will focus some in-depth analysis on a few OTW items highlighting a big winner(s) & big loser. I have provided a snapshot of their daily returns, but will also be referring to some of the statistics in the Weekly Rundown graph. So, let's begin.
Big Winner - Alexandre Lacazette (Arsenal)
Looking at the OTW player list, Aubameyang has been in sinilating form, but we opted for his Arsenal teammate,Alexandre Lacazette as this week’s biggest winner. Not too long ago we picked on Lacazette as a biggest loser, but within that article we stressed there was opportunity, and now some people will be reaping the benefits.

After recovering from a lengthy injury, the French striker seems to be finding form he hadn’t experienced since his summer transfer. His value should stay steady around its current price even after this hype, so we are going to forgo in-depth statistical analysis this week. Instead we're going to focus on his outlook which is almost better than Aubameyang considering he can feature in the Europa League. Also, if defenses start focusing on the Gabonese striker, this Frenchman could make them pay for giving him too much space. 
Make sure to check that optimism and always do your research, especially when a player is experiencing serious hype. At this point, if you are thinking about picking up this item, we recommend getting in low on open bids or snipes, and take profit when you can get it. 
Big Loser - Federico Bernardeschi (Juventus)
So, we’re not doing Cenk Tosun again, and Khouma Babacar may have had a big loss but now he’s discard (so keep that in mind), but that leaves us with our third choice for this week's biggest loser in Federico Bernardeschi. It pains me to rag on an ex-Fiorentina player, although his departure wasn’t the prettiest, so I am sure the Viola faithful would allow it. 
Bernardeschi sports an interesting weekly stat line with a medium volatility figure (~4,000) and high beta (3.59). We don't see that combination often, but it demonstrates that the Italian winger maybe in store for even greater price shifts. If he can pick up a second upgrade his price could skyrocket; however, at the moment it is looking more likely that his price trend should continue downward. At 84 overall he is one of the better RW options in Serie A, but he is currently selling at a premium for special items around that rating. 
In terms of outlook, Bernardeschi has a pretty positive one. His price is still slipping down to its equilibrium; however, recently back from injury he should get plenty of game time due to Juventus’s busy fixture list this month. So, be patient on this week’s biggest loser, but there is still value here. 

Recap & outlook
For most of the week, the FUT market continued its gradual climb up, but when EA dropped the unforeseen FUT Swap promo the hype generated coincided with the general market beginning to dip. Fears of large promotions such as Team of the Knockout Stage and Team of the Season may compound this decline, so stay on your toes. The Ones to Watch sector delivered some great returns this week, but make sure to be more cautious as domestic season draw to a close. The window for profit is getting smaller meaning its imperative to take it whenever you can get it! On that emfatic note, here are some final quick takes:
-- OTW traders: Look into some of those items that missed the TOTW, panic sellers present a great opportunity for flipping.     

-- OTW investors: Your profit window is getting smaller, and be weary of a market crash at the end of the month. There are still plenty of close to discard options and that's probably the best place for positive returns at the moment.  

This week we are throwing you a curveball, and would love to know which One to Watch item you’ve most enjoyed playing with this year? I know, since when does gameplay have a place here? All kidding aside, if you can’t get enough market analysis check out our latest Path to Glory update too.

CONCACAF is a heck of a drug.
While it doesn't always provide the best possible football, both semifinals as well as this year's Gold Cup Final were appropriately decent. Jamaica snuck past Mexico on a late free-kick, powered by Philadelphia Union's masterful keeper Andre Blake's play. While he'd go down with a consequential injury in the final, the US Men's National Team would secure their spot over a more senior Costa Rica team thanks to near-record-breaker Clint Dempsey of Sounders FC, who equaled the USMNT's all-time goal scoring record late in that one.
The final, after Blake went down, wasn't exactly all USA. Jamaica had a couple opportunities to take it, but a late rebound rocket from Dempsey Seattle teammate Jordan Morris proved to be the difference in the US's 2-1 win.
For their Gold Cup troubles, all three get week-long orange upgraded FUT items.
You might not care, but maybe your favorite Jamiacan or American senior team fan will be into it. Or maybe the most hardcore collector you know. EIther way.

Market Overview
Another tame week for the FUT market overall, with the FUT Swap promotion stilling ramping up. We did receive some surprise League SBCs, so hopefully you can sell off any long term investments you locked up. Generally, prices continue to rise and fall holding relatively stable, but with big promotions on the horizon it might be time to consider going liquid (selling some of your players). 
Focusing on the Path to Glory market, these items amplified the regular market fluctuations. Mostly big weekly gains show a nice picture on the surface, but we are a little weary this week. Positive returns are not a good sign for every item, which we will cover later in the article. It is getting to the point where it's imperative to sell if you see profit, and stick close to discard players in high hype leagues.
Important Note: The data/prices will be taken from Xbox One. However, this year, player prices across both consoles seem more similar than ever. If PS4 players have feedback, please let us know. 
Weekly Returns & Stats



The graph above is a concise overview of all the keypoints from the data I collected over the week (data below). Do not fret if some of the terms are unfamiliar as I will do my best to explain what they are, and how they are significant to the PTG market. 

Highs/Lows
These figures represent the highest and lowest prices of the items over the week. Note that these can come from any price during the week, so always check the price before listing. 
-- Quick take:  The are some wacky high/low spreads in the graphic above, and that is a testament to the market’s uncertain state. Like we said above, we are going to stick to high hype leagues, and a few players who catch are eye as good value targets are Alejandro Gomez, Divock Origi and Ousmane Dembele.      

Volatility
Volatility, measured in terms of coins and a metric of risk, reflects the price fluctuation trends of the PTG player’s item.
-- Quick take: There are some big time figures in this section this week. Volatility up this high continues to reinforce our comment about uncertainty in the market, and with Team of the Season looming we can see why. Usually we look for opportunity, but this week we’re focusing on those who might drop. Marcus Rashford, Raphael Varane, and Rodrigo might be players you want to close positions on, and look for better risk/reward options. 
Beta
Beta, another risk statistic, represents the tendency of an item to respond to swings in the market, and the higher the value the greater the expected price shift.
-- Quick take: Interestingly, there seems to be some discrepancy between Autumn and Spring items when it comes to beta. Autumn items have much higher figures across the board, so you should take note that they might be more susceptible to market swings going forward. With that in mind look to the likes of Tiemoue Bakayoko and Thomas Lemar to hold their value relatively well, especially if you can pick them up on open bids near their “low” price. 
TOTW & Upgrade Shout 
Another week with a couple TOTW shouts and a MOTM watch. This week, some great low price and high hype players stole the show in Danny Welbeck and Thorgan Hazard. The English striker put away two goals against Southampton, and finally looks to pick up a special item after a rather solid Europa league campaign. Shifting to Germany, Eden’s younger brother also grabbed a brace in a 2-1 win, which will put a smile on investor who liked the look of that central card.

Now, it's worth mentioning Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain received some hype after a beautiful long range strike against Manchester City in the first leg of their Champions League tie. So, keep in mind his hype is directed more towards a Man of the Match or Team of the Knockout Stage item. This means an upgrade might be coming in the next couple weeks, rather than Wednesday.

Big Winner - Danny Welbeck  (Arsenal)
Over the past couple of weeks, we have been preaching the low value high hype potential items, and the Arsenal man proved us right. So, with a massive 133% return Danny Welbeck is this week's biggest winner. 
The Manchester United youth product is currently extinct on the market, and because of that his stat line is super inflated at the moment. So, we will forgo digging into his volatility and beta, and go straight to our recommendation. At the moment, you should be looking to sell into the hype. It’s best practice to sell most now for the guaranteed profit, then hold a couple if you think you can list them right when that price range updates.   

Going forward, Welbeck’s price will follow the trend of past upgraded dynamic items meaning it will gradually fall alongside his informs price. Keep that in mind, but also we would stay away from him as an investment considering there are only a finite amount of games left and Alexandre Lacazette still eats into his minutes.

Big Loser - Raheem Sterling (Manchester City) 
Last week we said expect Dimitri Payet’s price to drop and it did. So, with expectations already in place for his item we had to find a different loser. And, Manchester City fans might agree this week’s biggest loser is Raheem Sterling. 
The team’s midweek UCL rout was exacerbated by the fact they blew a two goal lead over the weekend , and now half to wait for the title. How Sterling comes into play is that he missed a couple sitters which should’ve put the game away at 4-0. Besides the slight embarrassment for Sterling, we also chose him this week considering his price is at risk if the market begins to tank. 
It might be time to take profit if you can get it on Sterling, but there is a silver lining in his outlook. If the ex-Liverpool man’s price does plummet around TOTS he could be a sneaky investment choice going into the World Cup. Still a lot of hype in this item, so monitor accordingly. 
Recap
A pretty standard week for the general FUT market, but make sure you take note of its uncertain state. With big promotions such as Team of the Knockout Stage and Team of the Season set to drop over the next few weeks, selling some of your highworth players should be considered. Always better to get ahead of the market when it comes to liquidating, and it also presents an opportunity for you to spice up FIFA by trying some budget beast like Valere Germain (shoutout FUT Weekly Pod). 
The Path to Glory sector had a positive week, which is great for investors, but just like the overall FUT market, it might be time to sell. There is definitely still value in this sector, but prices are a little inflated at the moment. If you do plan on trying to make moves here, stick to those low value players in the high hype leagues (PL, La Liga etc..). 
Let us know any budget beasts you’ve been using this FIFA, and bonus points if its a PTG item? Share below, and we’ll catch you all next week!

The final EA Sports FIFA 17 Team of the Season is finally here. 
This evening, we got the MLS TOTS officially. iGoldenBear and others on Twitter first noticed them when a video revealing the players leaked early in-game.
The team features a handful of international superstars like Kaka, David Villa, and Bastian Schweinsteiger, as well as a plethora of American players fresh off of a CONCACAF Gold Cup Victory.
Toronto FC’s Sebastian GIovinco will likely be the most popular MLS TOTS card, as the CF has 95 pace, 90 shooting, and 95 dribbling. His teammates Michael Bradley and Jozy Altidore also get TOTS cards. Bradley joins the Gullit Gang with an extremely well rounded card featuring a 93 physical raiting.
American LB Demarcus Beasley gets a silver TOTS card with 90 pace, a card that could go for quite a lot of coins even this late in FIFA 17 as the only solid LB option for American national squads. 
The squad will be available in packs until August 8.
Check out the full squad below and their ratings here:

We nailed it with last week's predictions, predicting that EA would follow their Europa League selection with Champions League ties. Going 4/4 is always nice, but there was still a major curveball with EA making the reward FUT Swap Fellaini. This unexpected twist gave the community mixed feelings, but regardless, it raised the value of the featured clubs’ players tremendously. Going forward, we would love to see more special cards be part of Marquee Matchup rewards. If that continues it’ll be even more important to get in on investments early. 
Top Picks
As only four matchups typically make the SBC group, here are the four we think are the most likely to be selected:
Disclaimer: These are educated guesses and NOT guarantees. Invest accordingly at your own risk.
Manchester United vs Tottenham
Match Info: We start this week with a big time cup match in England. The semifinals of the FA cup feature this match, as well as Chelsea vs Southampton, and last year EA dropped a Marquee Matchup including FA Cup fixtures last year. So, looking back at that example, pick up a few of these cards on open bid. They should hold their value due to League SBC.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team 


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Juventus vs Napoli 
Match Info:  Turning our attention to Italy, a huge matchup between the league’s top two sides highlights their match week. Napoli needs the win to stay in the race with Juventus, and a matchup of this caliber should warrant EA’s selection even though Juventus is currently featured in this week's matchups. If they forgo this game because of the Old Lady’s current inclusion, look to Fiorentina vs Lazio as the next best bet.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


AZ Alkmaar vs Feyenoord
Match Info: Another cup match makes its way into our predictions; however, this one is the final of the Dutch domestic cup. Cup finals have made their appearances in this SBC recently, and we think this will follow suit. Stock up a some non-rare gold options here. 

Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 rated


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 players from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Dortmund vs Leverkusen
Match Info: Bayern may have wrapped up the Bundesliga title this past week; however, there is still plenty to play for in the German top flight. This week, two top-four clubs in Dortmund and Leverkusen square off in a heated battle to secure Champions League football. This is just the type of match up EA’s alley, so a few investments can’t hurt here.
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 78 overall 


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Sleeper Picks
There’s never four clear locks for Marquee Matchups, and we would not be doing our due diligence as investors if we didn’t consider additional fixtures. With already plenty of writing above, we’re going to keep this section short this week, and just hit you with the essentials: 
Arsenal vs West Ham
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 76 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Midtjylland vs Brondby 
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 72 overall


Player Requirement: 1 player from each team


Team Chemistry: Min. 95 chemistry


Real Salt Lake vs Colorado
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Liege vs Anderlecht
Predicted Requirements:


Team Overall Rating: Min. 74 overall


Player Requirement: 1 to 2 player from either team


Team Chemistry: Min. 90 chemistry


Deep Sleeper Picks
This cycle has an interesting mix of derbies and high profile matches, so we are going to go with a pick from the former in this slot. Serie B players from these teams should be low risk and high reward, just don’t go crazy here.  

Foggia vs Bari
Recap

With money, fame and bragging rights on the line, Day 4 of the first ever eMLS Cup did not disappoint. Quality competitive FIFA from all the competitors meant every fixture hung in the balance. At the end of the day only one player could come out on top, and Houston’s Memo Trevino (Kid M3Mito) was the last man standing. He was in control throughout the tournament, and capped a surreal week in Boston as the undefeated champion of the eMLS.

Round 3 Conference Finals
Eastern Conference Finals
NYCFC (1) vs Montreal Impact (3)
Montreal’s Lyes Ould-Ramoul (LyesMTL)  defeats NYCFC’s Chris Holly (didychrislito) 2-1
A lot of hype before this match considering their two draws in the “regular season”.  NYCFC’s Ronald Matarrita cut out a dangerous cross from Lyes, but after 10 minutes it was Lyes opening the scoring with a low driven shot from Cristiano Ronaldo. This early goal prompted Lyes to make an early defensive change by bringing on TOTY Leonardo Bonucci to hold down the backline. With Lyes continuing to dominate possession, and Chris waiting for a mistake the half finished on that scoreline.

The second half kicked off where the first half left off in a cagey possession game. The 70th minute saw a huge save from Chris’ David De Gea, and with only twenty minutes remaining it prompted him to make changes of his own. The clock was winding down, but Holly kept his cool and a beautiful turn and finish from Paul Pogba leveled the score. After a rough give away at the halfway line, Lyes made Chris pay cutting through the defense and clinically finishing with Lionel Messi. NYCFC pushed everything, but it was not to be with Montreal’s Lyes advancing to the eMLS Cup final. 

Western Conference Finals
Houston (1) vs FC Dallas (3)
Houston’s Memo Trevino (Kid M3Mito) defeats FC Dallas’ Alan Avila (AlanAvi) 4-3
A matchup that was poised for lots of goals, kicked off with a quick strike from Memo using Houston's very own Alberth Elis. Coincidentally, that goal also came in the 10th minute, but FC Dallas’ Alan leveled quickly with a beautiful hit from Luka Modric in the 14th minute. This game’s intensity level just kept rising with Memo restoring his lead through a tidy Romain Alessandrini header. After a nice shot from Messi, Memo’s Alessandrini was there for his second to make it 3-1 before half. 
The Houston man kept up his domination in the second half, with Neymar making it 4-1. Alan kept his spirit up, but after missing a great opportunity around the 50th minute it looked dier. The 60th minute saw Alan break through after a well worked counter making it 4-2, and after a few half chances a penalty followed in the 90th minute making it 4-3, but it wouldn’t be enough.

Round 4 Third Place match & Grand Final
Third Place Match
NYCFC (1) vs FC Dallas (3)  
NYCFC’s Chris Holly (didychrislito) defeats FC Dallas’ Alan Avila (AlanAvi) 5-3 on aggregate
In the first cross-conference matchup both players looked a little disappointed, but once the game got rolling there was no holding back. Alan had two great chance to start the match, but De Gea bailed out Chris. It was Chris’ turn to strike and Gareth Bale an absolute beauty was put placed in the top left corner to open the scoring, 1-0 to NYCFC. Just like he’s done throughout the tournament, Alan equalized at 1-1 with Messi making no mistake this time. The second half of the first leg saw players trade chances, but both De Geas were standing on their heads. In the 86th minute, Alan broke the deadlock with his own Bale taking a 2-1 lead into the second leg. 
The second leg began in a much more subdued manner. Neither player could really find traction until Chris broke the deadlock right on the 45th minute after a scramble in the box. Then, the second half kicked off with Chris banging in a CR7 header to go 2-0 up (3-2 on aggregate). Alan’s misery was compiled after the 70th minute when Chris struck twice quickly making it 4-0. There was slight hope for Alan as he slotted a low shot past De Gea in the 80th minute but again it was too little too late. Two entertaining ties capped off a greater tournament for both players, and they should be proud.
Grand Final
Houstoun (1) vs Montreal Impact (3)
Houston’s Memo Trevino (Kid M3Mito) defeats La Galaxy’s Giuseppe Guastella (GGGodfather) 2-1.
With $10,000 and a beautiful trophy on the line, both players settled in for this two leg affair. It was 4-4-2 versus 4-3-3(5), and this final would prove to be the real deal. With the stakes high, both players were playing tentive in the opening minutes; ten grand at stake can do that to you. In the 37th minute, it was Memo opening the scoring through Alessandrini, following a brilliant counter attack, 1-0 Houston. 
As the second half opened Lyes found an equalizer with Messi, as he has done so often this eMLS Cup. He was again rewarded by Messi in the 81st minute to make it 2-1 late on. But, with the last kick of the game Memo made it 2-2 after an extremely well worked possession build around the top of the box. All square after the first leg meant it was all on the line in the second tie.
After a short break, the players strapped back in for a wild ride. Houston’s Memo would take another lead after a Ronaldo shot was saved by De Gea, yet the deflection looped up and in (3-2 on aggregate). Memo continued to pepper Lyes’ goal, but he held firm, leaving it 1-0 at half. After a crazy sequence in the box, Marcelo collect his own rebound off the post to level it for Lyes at 1-1 (3-3 on aggregate). Only moments later, Memo’s Ronaldo drove a low driven shot under the legs of De Gea to restore his lead. Not a moment for the crowd to catch their breath.
Nearing the 70th minute, Lyes tried to pull a sneaky offside trap, but Memo played around it perfectly and capitalized on an empty net to open up a two goal lead (5-3). But as soon as the crowd settled down, the Montreal player responded with a beautiful Messi drive into the bottom corner to keep the pressure on. In the end, Memo played around Lyes’ high pressure and netted a hattrick with Ronaldo to see it off 4-2 (6-4 on aggregate). The Houston man capped off an amazing tournament, but both competitors should hold their heads high.
Day 4 Recap & Final Thoughts
The eMLS Cup put on an extremely entertaining tournament. From eight-goal thrillers to great sportsmanship, the competition had it all. The squads were fresh, and the no Icons rule didn’t dampen the fun at all. Overall, a step in the right direction for North America competitive FIFA, and hats off to Memo ""Kid M3mito"" Trevino for coming out as champion. We're all looking forward to both Houston Dynamo’s Trevino and Montreal Impact’s Lyes ""LyesMTL"" Ould-Ramoul representing North America in the FIFA eWorld Cup Global finals.

Though there are no further End of an Era SBC player items being released, today, we'll be taking at look back at the End of an Era SBC Frank Lampard.

Just like the other EoaE items, Lampard receives this item to celebrate the end of his illustrious career, which included long spells with West Ham and Chelsea, as well as shorter stints with Swansea, Manchester City, and NYCFC. A profilic goal-scorer, Lampard ends his career having scored 274 times in 913 club appearances, as well as 29 goals scored in the space of 106 England caps.
In-game stats and rating.
This EoaE SBC item is very similar to the item given to Francesco Totti, in terms of the pace, dribbling and physical.

He has 80 pace, with 99 acceleration but just 63 sprint speed, 96 shooting (including 99 long shots and shot power), 93 passing (with 95 short and long-passing), 88 dribbling (but just 62 agility and balance), 78 defending and 90 physical (with 96 strength and 72 stamina).
To boost his abysmal sprint speed, agility and balance, I used the Engine chemistry style.

This gives him 82 pace (with 68 acceleration), and boosts his dribbling to 95 (with 67 agility and 72 balance). He also receives 97 passing. With this chemistry style, he becomes a 96-rated CAM, a 95-rated CM and a 94-rated ST. 

Squad
I used Lampard in the following set up. He was used as a CAM in-game, with instructions to stay forward and not come back and defend.
http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7504709/

I was originally planning on using a squad that I wouldn't need to rearrange in-game. Then, I saw a wonderful comment on the FUTHead Facebook page (be sure to check us out!), on my SBC Gerrard review, about people who switch formations in-game and sub on Son, so I just had to do it again.
So, just for that guy (you know who you are), this is what the team looks like in-game (look, it's Heung-Min Son!):

Stats
As I didn't want to waste too many coins on this item (saving up for TOTS Lacazette), I used his loan version.
Here are my stats with Lampard after those 5 games:
Games: 5
Goals: 5
Assists: 2
Chemistry Style: Engine
Let's get into the review.
Review
I'm not going to sugar coat it: I didn't like this item. He's a solid player, but he has some major issues.
Many of these are the same issues I had with Totti. Lampard's stamina is horrific. He's dead after 50-60 minutes, even if he isn't dropping back to defend. He seems to love dropping deep, and then running into space, and that drains his tank incredibly quickly. In this game, you need at least 80 stamina to be competitive, and this item just doesn't have it. As his stamina falls, he feels worse on the ball, slower off the mark -- he becomes a worse player. Once again, this card is sold short as a result of having very low stamina.
Then, we get to his pace. It's awful. He's fast off the mark, but after a couple of steps, the defender is right back on him. His top speed is barely a sprint, and his high acceleration doesn't do anything for him. He can't get away from his man, he can't get into space quickly, and he can't break away when you need him to. It also affects his ability to close players down -- he just can't get there fast enough. With Totti, his sprint speed was much higher, so that item was deceptively slow, but still quick enough for some situations. This item is just not fast enough for most situations. As a result, you are forced to limit the amount of time Lampard spends on the ball, and desperately rely on his initial acceleration to get him away from the defenders closest to him.
The next con is a strange one —- unlike Gerrard, he felt stiff on the ball. This may have been because he was stopping and starting so often (so I could get away from his markers), or because his stamina was so poor, but he just didn't feel that good on the ball. His control and dribbling were perfect, but he turned like a tank, and I just couldn't wriggle my way past my opponents. And with a player with such poor speed, you need them to be decent on the ball to have a chance against the elite defenders. Frank Lampard just doesn't cut it in this aspect.
The card is still fantastic in other aspects. His shooting is incredible, and he can score from anywhere with any kind of shot. The four-star weak foot is crucial, and means that he's a threat on either side. His shot power is ridiculous — he hits the ball so hard that keepers struggle to react in time, and even if they do, they often just parry the ball out for a corner. His long shots were like bullets — they have curve, dip, power and accuracy, and are virtually impossible to stop if you hit them well. I tried a freekick or two with him, and he pinged the post twice.
His passing is very, very good. He has some of the best distribution in the game, and he does it effortlessly. He misplaced only a handful of passes in the five games, and was consistent under pressure. No issues here.
His physicality was a lot of fun. He wins every 50-50, and puts up a fight against every opponent. He's a very dominant player, and a lot of fun to use. The combination of high strength and high aggression means he is a nightmare for any opponent, and he can actually end up serving as a sort of battering ram to break through the opponent's defensive line.
His physicality makes his defending feel a lot better than it is. His tackles are a little sloppy, and interceptions can be all over the place, but he's so strong and aggressive that he inevitably ends up winning the ball back. He cleans up very well, and rarely lets players get away from him. However, the more he defends, the sooner his stamina gets depleted, and the worse he becomes. He might suit the CM position, but all-in-all, he might be a little lacking defensively.
I didn't feel like the lack of four-star skills was an issue at all. He made some excellent runs into good attacking positions, and was always on hand to cause the opponents issues. EA have got the mental attributes spot on. Lampard actually feels smart in game -- makes good decisions, brilliant runs, and sees passes that very few others can see. I haven't experienced this with too many players, so it was a welcome relief.
Summary
It boils down to this. For the same price, you can get Gerrard, and Gerrard is a way better player in FIFA 17. Lampard is slow, stiff, and has awful stamina. He gets closed down too easily in game, and he's just not nimble enough to get out of tight situations. And no matter how good he can be at times, he's useless at the end of games. This card has got some great technical and mental attributes, but they don't make up for this. Unlike Totti, whose main issue was the stamina, Lampard is lacking in some crucial aspects, and these issues prevent him from being a truly elite player.
Do I recommend getting him? No. I recommend getting the loan card, trying it out, and deciding for yourself. I know that 5 games isn't enough time to get a measure of the man, but my first impression was not great. I feel that Gerrard, and to some extent, Totti, can do everything this card can, and you should get those cards instead.
However, just like any other EoaE SBC card, if you are a fan of Lampard in real life, you should get this card. This is the best card he'll ever get in FIFA, and it can be a lot of fun. Just don't expect him to be the best player in the game.

Today, I'll be reviewing the FUTTIES Winner, position-changed, Alessandro Florenzi.

In a stunning turn of events, we have a non-BPL FUTTIES Winner! Florenzi receives this 86-rated CM FUTTIES card ahead of a potential CM Moussa Sissoko or a ST Inaki Williams.
In-game stats and rating
Florenzi's card looks utterly disgusting. Not only is he a member of the Gullit Gang, but every one of his card stats is 83+.
His in-game stats are similarly incredible. With only three stats in the 70s (74 strength, 77 heading, 79 composure), he has some of the most well-rounded stats in the game. He has a blistering 89 pace, solid shooting at 85, 86 passing, 88 dribbling, and 83 defending with 84 physical.

I felt that the Basic chemistry style was the best way to go for Florenzi.

Using that chemistry-style boosts all his card stats by at least 2, and leaves him with fantastic in-game stats. The best among them are his 95 acceleration, 93 positioning and shot power, 95 short passing, 99 agility, 95 ball control, 90 dribbling, 92 standing and 90 sliding tackle.
His in-game ratings are fantastic -- with the Basic chemistry style, he's 88+ rated in every position, and 91 rated at CM.

Squad
I used Florenzi in the following squad:

I did not change the formation in-game. I sometimes switched to the 41212(2) if I was defending a lead, but I wanted to try out this formation.
(This review was done on my friend's account, hence the lack of my beloved POTM Heung-Min Son, Maldini, FUTTIES Smalling and SBC Gerrard.)
Stats
Here are my stats with FUTTIES Florenzi:
Games: 6
Goals: 6
Assists: 3
Chemistry Style: Basic
I wanted to get this review out while the SBC was available, hence the limited number of games. 
Let's get into the review.
Review
I have two issues with this card. The first is that he does feel a little small and weak at times, and can get dominated in game. It means he can't play as a CDM, and he can get bullied by stronger CMs. These issues are largely fixed him he's played at CAM, or in a central CM role.
The second is his 3-star/3-star combination. It can hurt the card at times, especially when he's in tight situations. He's restricted to passing and shooting with his stronger foot, and that makes him very predictable. It also means that if he finds himself on the left-side of the field, he's quite useless -- he can't cross, his passes have to be forced onto the right foot, and he can't shoot across goal. His lack of skills can also pose an issue, especially if he plays further up the field (CAM/CF/ST).
Aside from these (relatively minor) issues, the card is spectacular. He's one of the better box-to-box midfielders I've used in this game.
First, his pace. He's very quick, and it's makes him a handful in the midfield. He's fast enough to get forward, as well as recover and win the ball back. I had absolutely no issues with his pace. He feels like Kante in this respect, and it means he can be everywhere on the field at once.
One of his big pros was his shooting. He can really hit them from a distance, and he's good enough to challenge the keeper inside the box. Just get yourself a yard of space, power up that shot, and watch it fly for the top corner. At this point in the game, there are a lot of keepers who are good at saving long shots, so he scores less than he would have a few months ago, but it's still a lot of fun to see. His finishing in and around the box is very good -- I didn't score too many with him (due to the lack of games), but his shots were accurate, powerful, and tested most keepers.
His passing was very good. He has good long and short passing, so he can distribute the ball with ease. His crossing is also very good, so I was able to whip a few into the box (didn't manage to score a header with Lacazette though). He honestly felt like a 90+ rated midfielder in this respect -- his passing is that good. It's very difficult to predict what pass he's about to pull off, because he can do all of them perfectly.
His dribbling surprised me, though in hindsight, it probably shouldn't have. He's incredibly agile, with phenomenal balance, ball-control and dribbling. You'll have no problem dribbling with this card. I don't think I saw him take a bad touch in the games I used him for, and while dribbling, the ball is no more than an inch or two from his feet, making him very hard to dispossess.
Finally, I really like his defending and physical. He has great interceptions, and very, very good tackling. He cleans up in the middle of the park, tackling anyone who crosses his path, and intercepting any loose balls that drift near him. Throw in his high aggression, and decent strength, and you have a player who just won't give up. He goes into every tackle with gusto, and more often than not, comes away with the ball. And did I mention his 99 stamina? Because he use that to work his magic all game long.
A word of caution though -- he feels like every other box-to-box midfielder with 78+ rated card stats. There isn't much about this card that will take your breath away, and not much that he can do that the rest of them can't (really, his pace is his only unique aspect). He's great, and he consistently gets the job done, but he's not unique in that respect. At this point in the game, there are plenty of good cards that you can get that play to his level -- TOTS Dendoncker and TOTS Jensen come to mind, as does TOTS Srna or TOTS Stindl (I found all of these players to be better than him). He's a brilliant player, and he will dominate the midfield, but he doesn't bring anything too new to the table.
Summary
As you can tell, I really enjoyed this card. He's a real game-changer, and one of the best box-to-box midfielders you can get in this game. He's so good going forward, fantastic creatively, and very solid defensively. Most importantly, he's a lot of fun to use, and he's very effective in game.
However, 100K is a lot of coins to put into an untradeable. This is especially true if he's not going to be a starter, and instead will be a super--sub. If he's going to be used as a super-sub, I recommend not getting this card. You'd be better off getting TOTS Dendoncker, TOTS Jensen or TOTS Srna as your sub. Florenzi's a very, very good player, but not an elite one. That's why I don't recommend getting him if you're looking for a super-sub.
As I mentioned earlier, I played these games on a friend's account. He loves Roma, and Florenzi is one of his favorite players, so he got this SBC without even thinking about it. Personally, I will not be unlocking this card -- he's not going to fit into my main team, and I already have better super--subs (TOTS Jensen, TOTS Dendoncker, TOTS Stindl). He was a lot of fun to use, but in my opinion, he's not worth 100K as a sub.

The English/Premier League fan-lip-service Squad Buildling Challenges we've all been waiting for are here.
Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard along with Chelsea great Frank Lampard have finally been immortalized with two of the best items their storied careers have received in FIFA Ultimate Team. Sure, they're with LA Galaxy and New York City FC in-game respectively, but with a couple English players around them, you should be sorted Chemistry wise.
The trickier part comes with the likely expense necessary to get these potential future Icons into your team. Many players (and traders alike) have been anticipating the pair for the last several weeks. Accordingly investments may well see the costs necessary to complete the SBCs at a high of the three week run of End of an Era players.
Like Totti, Kuyt, Lahm, and Alonso before them, you have until the end of FUT 17 to build and redeem Gerrard and Lampard. If you race to complete them, don't hesitate to let us know how they are in the comments below."

Crossing's been a bit of a ghost over the last couple FIFAs.
As is often the case in these sorts of situations, crossing a few games back was so overpowered, it needed to be governed. But the check almost more than outdid the previous issue. You shouldn't be scoring and/or conceding three goals on crosses a match ideally, but they also shouldn't be impossible, right?
FIFA 18 is a step back in the right direction. WIth new and improved crossing controls, it's easier than ever to put the ball where you want to and create opportunities you've been wanting to but been unable to for the last several games. Whether down the flanks in a 4-3-3 or 3-4-3 or while building an attack more centrally, you'll have more a more realistic ability to leverage the true marksmen/maestros of the game this coming Autumn:

One of the more fun promotions from the inaugural season of ""FIFA Mobile"" was the Golden Egg promo. Similar to those previously found in Madden Ultimate Team (and of course modeled after Charlie & The Chocolate Factory), if you received an ultra rare Golden Egg token, you were able to craft a 99-rated untradeable player of your choosing.
Some players chose to upgrade a FIFA console cult favorite. Others went for their favorite players in real life. And those that went for Silver or Bronze players produced particularly OP beasts.
Just like MUT, after giving the players that sculpted them an exclusivity period, Golden Egg packs were released, allowing all players a shot (albeit a slim one) to get their hands on these monster items themselves.
And while it's been some times since the first (and later second) run of those, a new round of Golden Egg promos ensures an awesome way for the potential final few months of FM -- assuming there's a reset as anticipated -- to get a whole lot more fun.
With new Golden Egg plans, you can obtain not just players but tokens and build new that Golden Egg player you wished you packed earler in the game. If you're lucky to enough to have already secured one, you can trade it in for five tokens, which may be enough to land another high-powered player now, or work towards another.
Some may be quick to look for fault in the offerings, but why not give newer players (and hardcore collectors) one final shot at the fun too?"

After some domination in the past few weeks from the usual big names, such as Hunterkiller and MooPiCait, this time it was a relatively unknown player who won the Versus Attack Mode (VsA) season, and has been honoured with a cTOTW. Enter 'Daniel' from the 'Royals' league.
Having taken the leaderboard by storm in the first few days of the seaons, Daniel quickly changed his team to feature some of the 'legends' of FIFA Mobile, such as Diego Alves and the 'Holy Trinity' of Ciman, Bailly and Chedjou - a trio who used to destroy all who came across them in the early months of the game - in order to provide us with a true throwback version of the Community Team of the Week.
The plans and players will be available from around 8 p.m. ET (1a.m. BST) on Thursday 20th July, with packs and the live evnet available twice throughout the week as usual.
The plan is available here for you to look over, as well as all of the players in game items for you to look at:
83 GK Diego Alves
89 LB Alex Sandro
88 CB Eric Bailly
84 CB Aurélien Chedjou

While there was some buzz about a second consecutive Premier League upset in Futties voting, Mousa Dembele takes home the win for favourite CM. Dembele's 86-rated Futties card puts him in the Gullit Gang, and it might even be better than Florenzi's position-swap CM card from last week.
Dembele was able to hold off Bayern Munchen CM Renato Sanches, a 78-rated player that has been in FUT squads all season.

Today, we'll be taking a look at the recently released End of an Era SBC Xabi Alonso. Alonso receives this item at the end of a storied and successful 18-year career, featuring stints with clubs such as Liverpool, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, 114 caps for the Spanish National team, during which he won everything that a player could win in football. 

This 94-rated Premium SBC item sees Xabi fall just two stats short of the ""Gullit Gang"" -- the elite group of players with 80+ on all six item stats -- and harkens back to this midfield maestro's prime.
In-game stats and rating
Alonso has some of the best technical stats in the game, from 99 shot power, long shots, positioning and penalties, to 99 short and long passing with 98 vision, as well as 99 reactions and ball control. He's also incredible defensively and physically, with 99 interceptions, 95 standing tackle, 96 aggression and 91 strength.

I used Alonso with an Anchor chemistry style , which boosts his stats to truly ridiculous levels. He goes up to 84 pace, 98 defending, and 92 physical, and looks like one of the best defensive midfielders in the game.

Here are his in-game ratings with the Anchor chemistry style:

Squads
Here is one of the squads I used Alonso in: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7361072/

In game,  I switch to a 41212(2) with Alonso playing in that CDM role.
Stats
Here are my stats with Alonso (across all squads):
Price: The SBC cost me around 100K.
Games Played: 32
Goals Scored: 14
Assists: 17
Chemistry Style: Anchor
Let's get into the review.
Review
I'll start with his negatives, because there aren't too many.
The first is his pace. Even with an anchor, he's a little on the slow side, and that does let him down at times. There are a handful of occasions, both offensively and defensively, where he is too far out of place, and too slow to recover. However, these are few and far between -- his pace is perfect for the CDM role, and he can cope with most situations.
The second is his stamina. It's not even close to as bad, or as problematic, as Totti's. This is because, unlike Totti, Alonso does his job perfectly and doesn't unnecessarily get involved in plays. His stamina runs out at about the 80th minute, but he's still able to dictate the play without being able to move. That being said, it is a little frustrating to have to sub him off the pitch every game.
The final con is a small one -- he can feel a little stiff in game. His lack of agility lets him down at times, and it is possible (but very difficult) for opponents to wriggle their way around him. However, this rarely happens, so we're all good.
Now, let's get to the good stuff.
His shooting is the stuff of legends. He feels like he has 99 shooting in game, simply because his finishing feels perfect, and the rest of his shooting stats are actually perfect. From range, he's lethal -- pretty much any shot is going to test the keeper, regardless of where it is fired from. Of the 14 goals he scored, at most three were from inside the box (and they were three very good finishes). All of the rest were long shots, or his perfect finesse shots from the edge of the box. He's one of the best shooters I've used this year, and a huge goal threat.
I'm going to keep this part short -- his passing is flawless. He can pull of any pass, from anywhere in the field, with any foot. He's the best passer in the game, and he controls the game like no one else. The number of assists he accumulated was ridiculous, and he must have created at least twice as many chances. His distribution is deadly, unpredictable and game-changing.
Despite his low agility, his ball-control, first touch, dribbling and reactions are perfect. So when he's on the ball, he can easily dribble past opponents. It's a lot of fun, because his ball control is touch tight, and he's completely reliable in possession. 
Finally, let's talk about his defensive abilities. They are sublime -- tackling is perfect, interceptions are ridiculous, and his ability to track and mark a man is awesome. He's the best CDM I've used this year, based on his defensive stats. What makes him better than a lot of other CDMs is his physicality. He's pretty tall, very strong, and hyper-aggressive, so he can dominate opponents and bully them off the ball. He feels like a tank in game, and his physical presence is clearly noticeable.
Summary
A lot of people will wonder why I enjoyed Alonso so much, and yet had so many issues with Totti, so I want to take a moment to clarify this. What ruined Totti's card was his low stamina, which makes him essentially useless past the 60th minute. In an attacking position, you need to be able to chase the ball, burst past defenders, and press the back line, until the last minute of the game, and Totti couldn't do that. In contrast, a defensive midfielder with the technical, defensive and physical stats that Alonso has can control the game without being able to move. Furthermore, I found his speed to be deceptively low, and I thought he felt worse on the ball than Alonso.
But enough of that -- let's get back to Alonso.
This is one of the best defensive midfielders in the game. Not only does he have perfect passing, and near-perfect defending, he's also good on the ball, has one of the best shooting stats around, and is an incredible physical presence. I cannot recommend this card enough.

FIFA Mobile's third week of the 'Retro Stars' promo is perhaps the most enticing yet. A third group of players from previous programs are back, with more possibilities to upgrade them than ever before.
Recognizing that previous weeks had proved a touch too difficult, this week not only are the players all tradeable once again, but so are the program tokens. There's also a new trade-in plan which makes partaking in the upgrades plans more possible than ever.
This week, Carniball, Lunar New Year, and Football Freeze are all represented in the form of:
-95 Carniball Dybala, with a new found higher ceiling and improved boosts to make up for his Rainbow-ing.
-New Everton signee Davy Klaassen, the former 90 OVR CAM from the LNY program (and his Ajax days). His new item is up to 94 overall.
-And last but not least, 85-overall Flash Freeze Alvaro Morata. His newly boosted overall makes him a treat for F2P and Best-Possible-Spain players alike.
With at least four or five more weeks of 'Retro Stars' to go, who else are you chomping at the bit to see? Maybe another Bailly or Chedjou? Or what about more MLS Playoff players? Let us know in the comments below."

It's been known for quite some time that ""Legends"" in FIFA Ulitmate Team would become a thing of the past, being replaced by Icons. However, thanks to a new video released by EA, we have been treated to a very exciting new piece of information regarding just how these new item types will work. These iconic players won't just get one card in the game, nor two. They will have three total item types coming in FIFA 18. 
As the name ""Icon Stories"" suggests, these new items will go through a progression from humble beginnings to the climax, much like a great book or television program. 
Why have @10Ronaldinho when you can have 3? #ICONS #FUTLIVE #FIFA18 #FUT18 pic.twitter.com/94dzFpGHK4— EA SPORTS FIFA (@EASPORTSFIFA) August 1, 2017

The first version of an Icon will start out with a lower rating representing the beginning of that certain player's career. 
The second version will have the Icon's normal rating. This would resemble a base legend card in past editions of FUT with the player have a rating that best represents the ""prime"" of that player's career. 
Finally, the third and final version will feature an upgraded ""in-form"" version.
Also announced, is the addition of Ronaldinho to the collection of Icons! 
Legendary players in Ultimate Team are going nowhere, but they are getting a huge makeover. These new Icon Stories should provide users with a better chance of getting their hands on some of their favorite ""Icons"" from the past."

From all the so-called ""Team of the Weaks"", FUT 17's TOTW 44 is arguably the most struggle bus to date.
The even recognizable names (or faces) are few and far between; Team of the Season recipient (and former SBC Player of the Year item receiver) Mike Jensen would've arguably been the most notoriety garnering. But with multiple superior special items out there, unless you're catering to maniacal late in game pack openers, what's the incentive for the production team to include him exactly?
Oleg Shatov, the Zenit St Peterburg (and Russian national) attacker would have been a nice name to see. But we'll have to settle for digging deep for optimism and embracing his club (and national team) teammate Alexandr Kokorin.
The usual assortment of K-League silvers and Ireland Premier Division bronzes are here (and borderline plentiful). And we know someone in the comments below will be tickled pink to see Johnathan from Suwon Samsung Bluewings get the nod. 
There's not much else to say. If you're into it, good on you. Maybe some of these in-forms will be useful in super-in-life-cycle Squad Building Challenges?"

Highlighting seven matches over the next two weeks, a Summer Celebration/Saint Patrick's Day-like FIFA Mobile promotion is upon us.
Taking place July 29, July 30, August 2, August 5, August 6, and August 8, live events those days will help you earn tokens and build towards seven different Global Tour Program Master items. As teased on social media Thursday, the exhibition and annual matches incorporated are the following:



The Fill Up Live Event leads things off. By knocking that out, you'll obtain Mobile Mile Tokens, which you can also get in packs from the Store. Take those mobile Mile Tokens to finish the specific Match Day plans and chase the master player from each match day accordingly.
Similar to the popular ""Summer Celebration"", after you complete a Match Day plan, you'll be able to play its Pre-Match Day Live Event (which on the day of the match evolves into the Match Day event).
Completing those will give you Global Tour Jet tokens on first win and then City-specific Souvenir tokens, Mobile Mile tokens, Tourist players from the match, or potentially even more Global Tour Jet ones.
You can use Silver Souvenir and Mobile Mile Tokens to complete specific cities'. Tourist Player plans. You'll need all four players plus a fixed number of Jet Tokens per match to unlock a match global tour master player. You'll also get an Elite Souvenir Token which as you can guess goes towards the Global Tour Program Legend.
The program kicks off this weekend with events targeted towards the Miami Clasico, Real Madrid vs FC Barcelona, and Saturday's match in Nashville, TN between Manchester City and Tottenham. 93 RWB Dani Carvajal, 92 ST Benzema, 90 RB Sergi Roberto, 94 CM Sergio Busquets, and 97 RWB Master Player Dani Carvajal lead things off for the first matchup with 91 GK Ederson, 93 RM Bernardo Silva, 90 CDM Eric Dier, 92 CAM Christian Eriksen, and 95 CAM Master Player Christian Eriksen in the second.
This should be a fun few weeks with plenty of obtainable player items and some fun live events in the process."

Last week's score 14/18
Formation 3-4-1-2
Squad Link: http://www.futhead.com/17/squads/7525781/

Goalkeeper
Alexandr Belenov - GK - 75 OVR
I incorrectly predicted a Belenov IF a few weeks back but I am going to take the same punt once more. There’s a reason that the Ufa keeper was involved in last year’s TOTS and his consistent performances are showing once more. He made a total of eight saves in their 1-1 draw, claiming MOTM in the process.
Defenders
Aytac Sulu - CB - 78 OVR
For some reason Sulu didn't actually feature in Kickers TOTW but considering he scored the only goal of the game in Darmstadt's 1-0 home win I can see EA overlooking that, especially as he is gold. 
Brandon Mechele - CB - 73 OVR
Brugge would have been guaranteed an IF if Bonaventure was in the game but considering that he’s not it becomes a 50/50 call with Mechele, who scored one of their four goals in a comfortable 4-0 win.
Ismaily - LB - 76 OVR
This ones a complete punt considering that Ismaily only recorded an assist in a 2-1 win but I am hoping that the gold factor will kick in and thus increase his chances of featuring in the side.
Midfielders
Mix Diskerud - RM - 70 OVR
The Swedish division offered very little this week which in contrast to previous selections made things difficult. One player who did stand out though is Diskerud who managed both a goal and assist during Goteborg's 4-1 home win.
Bribas Natcho  - CM - 77 OVR
The RPL is likely to feature heavily once again however with the lack of realistic options available who they are is hard to call. Natcho on paper has just the one goal but alongside a MOTM award he stands out from the division.
Ruben Sambueza - CAM - 78 OVR
There are a couple of players from Toluca which could make the cut but due to being gold I feel as though Sambueza is the best option. Although he has a goal and assist compared to Uribe's brace I believe he also picked up the MOTM award further helping his cause.
Kevin Molino - RM - 72 OVR
With Molino already obtaining a silver IF item if he does get in this week he will therefore be gold. This will help him as two assists for a silver midfielder looks significantly worse than two for a gold, that’s just the way it is. Two assists in a 4-0 win for Molino alongside MOTM puts him in line for that SIF.
Forwards
Lucas Podolski - ST - 80 OVR
A bit of a random one now with Podolski now playing his trade over in Japan for some reason. As a result of that his brace this weekend should see the German pick up an 87 rated IF at ST. Not so hard to link due to his nationality and likely to be the star of this side.
Kei Kamara - ST - 77 OVR
New England came away with a comfortable 3-0 win when they were visited by Philadelphia on Saturday. Kamara played a huge part in that as he not only scored two of the three NE goals but also recorded a goal line clearance to help keep the clean sheet. 
C.J Sapong - ST - 71 OVR
Due to the All-Star game the MLS has limited options in terms of who can actually receive an IF and thus that rules out the likes of Giovinco who was fantastic once again for Toronto. Sapong can pick up an IF though and with a goal, two assists and MOTM to his name he has a very strong chance.
Substitutes
Jules Goda - GK - 62 OVR
There are a couple of keepers that I feel are fighting for this position and either one of them would be a valid choice. I have selected Goda who made a total of eight saves in Ajaccio's 0-0 away draw. The other option is Sion's keeper, Mitryushkin who made seven saves in a 1-0 win. Seeing as the French league started this week and Goda is by far the best option I am going down that route.
Piotr Celeban - CB - 70 OVR
There were several defenders with attacking contributions to their name this week but with Celeban scoring two vital goals over in Poland I can see him getting the nod over them. The CB scored both the first and last goals of the match which resulted in a 3-2 home win for Wroclaw.
Daniel Toth - CDM - 66 OVR
Admira came away with an impressive 4-1 home win when they hosted Altach this weekend and the star man came from an unlikely source. Toth who was occupying the CDM role was involved in three of those goals, scoring two of his own alongside picking up an assist.
Cristian Ceballos - LM - 70 OVR
Sint Truiden upset Gent on the opening day of the season recording a 3-2 home win. The Spaniard was the star an scoring two of the three home goals alongside picking up MOTM. Due to the upset I can see him getting the nod over other potential players.
Lasse Vigen Christensen - CAM - 67 OVR
Christensen put in quite the performance in Brondby's thrilling 5-3 win over Lyngby after coming off the bench for the second half he somehow managed to bag himself a hat trick and an assist in order to turn the match around.
Christain Gytkjaer- ST - 72 OVR
There are several sub striker who scored twice this week and it then becomes a lottery as to who EA end up selecting. I am taking the punt on Poznan's striker, Gytkjaer who did exactly that.
Ola Kamara - ST - 71 OVR
Another Kamara now and although Ola is not as clear cut as Kei I can still see him getting in. Ola also scored twice for his side however it came in a 2-2 draw and with him being silver rather than gold it limits his chances. MLS often gets favoured though and with not many top performances he does stand out."
